2009,18927431,A peptomimetic inhibitor of BCL6 with potent antilymphoma effects in vitro and in vivo.,"The BCL6 transcriptional repressor is the most commonly involved oncogene in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). BCL6 lymphomagenic activity is dependent on its ability to recruit corepressor proteins to a unique binding site on its N-terminal BTB domain. A recombinant peptide fragment of the SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) corepressor that blocks this site can inhibit BCL6 biologic functions. Shortening and conversion of this peptide to D-amino acid and retro configuration as well as the addition of a fusogenic motif yielded a far more potent and stable BCL6 inhibitor that still retained the specificity of the original SMRT fragment. Like the L-peptide, retroinverso BCL6 peptide inhibitor (RI-BPI) selectively killed BCR rather than OxPhos-type DLBCL cells. The RI-BPI could recapitulate the failure to form germinal centers seen in BCL6 null mice yet was nontoxic and nonimmunogenic even when administered for up to 52 weeks. RI-BPI showed superior duration of tissue penetration and could accordingly powerfully suppress the growth of human DLBCLs xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, RI-BPI could kill primary human DLBCL cells but had no effect on normal lymphoid tissue or other tumors."
2001,12555508,[Is thiamine supplementation necessary in patient with cardiac insufficiency?].,"Interest has recently risen regarding thiamine deficiency in patients with cardiac deficiency who are receiving long-term diuretic therapy. Thiamine deficiency can lead biventricular myocardial failure (cardiac beriberi), and treatment consists of thiamine administration. Studies have shown that long-term furosemide use may be associated with thiamine deficiency through urinary loss, contributing to cardiac insufficiency in patients with congestive heart failure. Thiamine supplementation could improved left ventricular function. However, the results of those studies are controversial, and none study have till proved the clinical impact of a systematic administration of thiamine in a cohort of patients with cardiac insufficiency. To date, and waiting for available literature, thiamine administration should be consider in patients at risk for thiamine deficiency (elderly, malnourished, alcoholic), and in patients receiving very large doses of diuretics."
2004,15013856,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in grapes, suppresses oxidative damage and stimulates apoptosis during early colonic inflammation in rats.","Oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoid generation are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal bowel disease. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities, however, its effects on experimental colitis remain unknown. We have investigated the effects of resveratrol on the colon injury caused by intracolonic instillation of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) in rats. We determined the production of prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and PGD(2) in colon mucosa and the expression of cyclo-oxygenases (COX)-1 and -2 immunohistochemically. The inflammatory response was assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase activity, as an index of neutrophil infiltration. Interleukin-1 beta production, histological and histochemical analysis of the lesions were also carried out. Finally, since resveratrol has been found to modulate apoptosis we intended to elucidate its effects on colonic mucosa under early acute inflammatory conditions. Resveratrol (5-10mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the degree of colonic injury, the index of neutrophil infiltration and the levels of the cytokine. Resveratrol did not revert the increased PGE(2) levels but produced a significant fall in the PGD(2) concentration. Compared with inflamed colon, no changes in staining for COX-1 were observed in colon of resveratrol and TNBS-treated rats. In contrast, COX-2 expression was decreased. Furthermore, resveratrol enhanced apoptosis compared with already high level induced by TNBS. In conclusion, resveratrol reduces the damage in experimentally induced colitis, alleviates the oxidative events and stimulates apoptosis."
2013,23411221,"Investigation of isotope dilution mass spectrometric (ID-MS) method to determine niacin in infant formula, breakfast cereals and multivitamins.","An isotope dilution LC/mass spectrometric (ID-LC/MS) method was developed as a candidate reference method for the accurate determination of niacin in infant formula, breakfast cereals and multivitamin. After spiking nicotinamide-d(4) as an internal standard, infant formula and breakfast cereal samples were hydrolysed under alkaline condition. Samples were then analysed in SRM mode to detect nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid-d(4) at m/z 124→80 and 127→84, respectively. In the case of multivitamin sample that contains mainly free nicotinamide, LC/MS monitored nicotinamide and nicotinamide-d(4) at their SRM channels of m/z 123→80 and m/z 127→84, respectively, after simple extraction. The repeatability and reproducibility were tested for the validation of the developed ID/LC-MS method. Additionally, the developed analytical method was applied to determine total niacin contents in homogenised infant formula, homogenised multivitamin, and commercially available products including different types of infant formula, breakfast cereals, and multivitamin tablets."
2013,23656796,Dietary arginine affects energy metabolism through polyamine turnover in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).,"In the present study, quadruplicate groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were fed plant protein-based diets with increasing arginine inclusions (range 28·8-37·4 g/kg DM) to investigate whether arginine supplementation affects growth and lipid accumulation through an elevated polyamine turnover. Dietary lysine was held at a constant concentration, just below the requirement. All other amino acids were balanced and equal in the diets. Arginine supplementation increased protein and fat accretion, without affecting the hepatosomatic or visceralsomatic indices. Dietary arginine correlated with putrescine in the liver (R 0·78, P= 0·01) and with ornithine in the muscle, liver and plasma (P= 0·0002, 0·003 and 0·0002, respectively). The mRNA of ornithine decarboxylase, the enzyme producing putrescine, was up-regulated in the white adipose tissue of fish fed the high-arginine inclusion compared with those fed the low-arginine diet. Concomitantly, spermidine/spermine-(N1)-acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine turnover that consumes acetyl-CoA, showed an increased activity in the liver of fish fed the arginine-supplemented diets. In addition, lower acetyl-CoA concentrations were observed in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet, while ATP, which is used in the process of synthesising spermidine and spermine, did not show a similar trend. Gene expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, was up-regulated in the liver of fish fed the high-arginine diet. Taken together, the data support that increased dietary arginine activates polyamine turnover and β-oxidation in the liver of juvenile Atlantic salmon and may act to improve the metabolic status of the fish.

2011,21039435,Strategies for prevention of scars: what can we learn from fetal skin?,"Fetal wound healing occurs rapidly and without scar formation early in gestation. Studying the mechanisms of scarless repair can lead to novel scar-preventive approaches. In fetal wounds, collagen is deposited early and is fine and reticular with less cross-linking. Several important differences of fetal vs. postgestational wound-healing response have been determined, such as the presence of less inflammation, higher hyaluronic acid concentration and a greater ratio of collagen type III to type I. Compared with typical wounds, there are also altered ratios of signaling molecules, such as higher ratios of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3 to TGF-β1 and -β2, and matrix metalloproteinases to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Furthermore, fetal fibroblasts do not exhibit TGF-β1-induced collagen production compared with their mature counterparts. Patterning genes (homeobox genes) involved in organogenesis are more active in the fetal period and are believed to be the ""first domino"" in the fetal cutaneous wound repair regulatory cascade. The recommended scar-preventive agents, such as Scarguard MD®, silicone gel and sheet, Seprafilm® Bioresorbable Membrane, topical hyaluronan, onion extract, oral tamoxifen and 585-nm pulsed dye laser are reviewed in this study. Despite the lack of supporting evidence, there is a widespread false presumption that the acceleration of healing with the widely assumed scar-preventive commercial agents is associated with decreased scar formation. Humans are erroneously inclined to make a negative correlation between the healing rate and the degree of scar formation, while such a correlation does not exist in reality. Despite the importance of scar prevention, no FDA-approved therapy for this purpose is available in the 21st century, which reflects the important challenges, such as the presence of redundant pathways, that these approaches are facing."
2015,24719213,"Effects of Nigella sativa, Lepidium sativum and Trigonella foenum-graecum on sildenafil disposition in beagle dogs.","The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of some commonly used herbs namely Nigella sativa, Lepidium sativum and Trigonella foenum-graecum on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in beagle dogs. The study design involved four treatments in a non-balanced crossover design. Sildenafil was given one tablet 100 mg orally to each dog and blood samples were obtained. After a suitable washout period, animals were commenced on a specific herb treatment for 1 week. Blood samples were withdrawn at different time intervals and sildenafil was analyzed by HPLC method. Oral administration of Nigella sativa resulted in reduction of AUC0-∞, C max and t 1/2 as compared to the control. Treatment of Lepidium sativum resulted in a significant reduction in the C max and AUC. There were no significant differences between the rests of the pharmacokinetic parameters relative to those of the control. For Trigonella foenum-graecum, the effects were similar to those obtained in case of Lepidium sativum. It was concluded that concurrent use of investigated herbs alters the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil. Co-administration of investigated herbs should be cautious since their concomitant use might result in decrease in sildenafil bioavailability. "
2014,25105221,Vitamins B2 and B6 as determinants of kynurenines and related markers of interferon-γ-mediated immune activation in the community-based Hordaland Health Study.,"Vitamins B2 and B6 are cofactors in the kynurenine pathway. Many of the kynurenines are neuroactive compounds with immunomodulatory effects. In the present study, we aimed to investigate plasma concentrations of vitamins B2 and B6 as determinants of kynurenines and two markers of interferon-γ-mediated immune activation (kynurenine:tryptophan ratio (KTR) and neopterin). We measured the concentrations of vitamins B2 and B6 vitamers, neopterin, tryptophan and six kynurenines (i.e. kynurenine, anthranilic acid, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and xanthurenic acid) in plasma from 7051 individuals. Dietary intake of vitamins B2 and B6 was assessed using a validated FFQ. Associations were investigated using partial Spearman's correlations, generalised additive models, and segmented or multiple linear regression. The B2 vitamer, riboflavin, was positively associated with 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and xanthurenic acid, with correlation coefficients, as obtained by segmented regression, of 0·20 (95 % CI 0·16, 0·23) and 0·24 (95 % CI 0·19, 0·28), at riboflavin concentrations below the median value (13·0 nmol/l). The vitamin B6 vitamer, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), was positively associated with most kynurenines at PLP concentrations < 39·3-47·0 nmol/l, and inversely associated with 3-hydroxykynurenine with the association being more prominent at PLP concentrations < 18·9 nmol/l. Riboflavin and PLP were associated with xanthurenic acid only at relatively low, but normal concentrations of both vitamers. Lastly, PLP was negatively correlated with neopterin and KTR. These results demonstrate the significant and complex determination of kynurenine metabolism by vitamin status. Future studies on B-vitamins and kynurenines in relation to chronic diseases should therefore integrate data on relevant biomarkers related to B-vitamins status and tryptophan metabolism. "
2017,28992471,Parkia speciosa empty pod prevents hypertension and cardiac damage in rats given N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester.,"Parkia speciosa Hassk is a plant found abundantly in Southeast Asia region. Its seeds with or without pods and roots have been used in traditional medicine in this region to treat hypertension. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential effect of the plant empty pod extract on hypertension development and changes in heart induced by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) administration in rats. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Groups 1 to 3 were given l-NAME (25mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 8 weeks. Groups 2 and 3 were also given Parkia speciosa empty pods methanolic extract (800mg/kg, orally) and nicardipine (3mg/kg, orally), concurrently with l-NAME. The last group served as the control. l-NAME reduced plasma nitric oxide level and therefore, increased systolic blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme and NADPH oxidase activities as well as lipid peroxidation in the heart. Parkia speciosa extract and nicardipine treatments had significantly prevented the elevations of blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme, NADPH oxidase activities and lipid peroxidation in the heart induced by the l-NAME. Parkia speciosa extract but not nicardipine prevented the reduction in plasma nitric oxide level caused by l-NAME. In conclusion, Parkia speciosa empty pods methanolic extract has a potential to prevent the development of hypertension possibly by preventing the loss of plasma nitric oxide, as well as has cardioprotective effects by reducing angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and oxidative stress in the heart in rats administered l-NAME."
2004,15283463,Tissue factor inhibitory sesquiterpene glycoside from Eriobotrya japonica.,"Tissue factor (TF, tissue thromboplastin) is a membrane bound glycoprotein, which accelerates the blood clotting, activating both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways to serve as a cofactor for activated factor VII (VIIa). The TF-factor VIIa complex (TF/VIIa) proteolytically activates factors IX and X, which leads to the generation of thrombin and fibrin clots. In order to isolate TF inhibitors, by means of a bioassay-directed chromatographic separation technique, from the leaves of Eriobotrya japonica Lindley (Rosaceae), a known sesquiterpene glycoside (2) and ferulic acid (3) were isolated as inhibitors that were evaluated using a single-clotting assay method for determining TF activity. Another sesquiterpene glycoside (1) was also isolated but was inactive in the assay system. Compound 3 was yielded by alkaline hydrolysis of compound 2. The structures of compounds 1, 2, and 3 were identified by means of spectral analysis as 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl nerolidol (1), 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[alpha-L-(4-trans-feruloyl)-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl nerolidol (2) and ferulic acid (3), respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited 50% of the TF activity at concentrations of 2 and 369 microM/TF units, respectively."
2013,23827652,Sulfur mustard induced nuclear translocation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH).,"Sulfur Mustard (SM) is a vesicant chemical warfare agent, which is acutely toxic to a variety of organ systems including skin, eyes, respiratory system and bone marrow. The underlying molecular pathomechanism was mainly attributed to the alkylating properties of SM. However, recent studies have revealed that cellular responses to SM exposure are of more complex nature and include increased protein expression and protein modifications that can be used as biomarkers. In order to confirm already known biomarkers, to detect potential new ones and to further elucidate the pathomechanism of SM, we conducted large-scale proteomic experiments based on a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) exposed to SM. Surprisingly, our analysis identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as one of the up-regulated proteins after exposure of HaCaT cells to SM. In this paper we demonstrate the sulfur mustard induced nuclear translocation of GAPDH in HaCaT cells by 2D gel-electrophoresis (2D GE), immunocytochemistry (ICC), Western Blot (WB) and a combination thereof. 2D GE in combination with MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis identified GAPDH as an up-regulated protein after SM exposure. Immunocytochemistry revealed a distinct nuclear translocation of GAPDH after exposure to 300μM SM. This finding was confirmed by fractionated WB analysis. 2D GE and subsequent immunoblot staining of GAPDH demonstrated two different spot locations of GAPH (pI 7.0 and pI 8.5) that are related to cytosolic or nuclear GAPDH respectively. After exposure to 300μM SM a significant increase of nuclear GAPDH at pI 8.5 occurred. Nuclear GAPDH has been associated with apoptosis, detection of structural DNA alterations, DNA repair and regulation of genomic integrity and telomere structure. The results of our study add new aspects to the pathophysiology of sulfur mustard toxicity, yet further studies will be necessary to reveal the specific function of nuclear GAPDH in the pathomechanism of sulfur mustard.

1999,10468856,Bone marrow effects of anagrelide therapy in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.,"In a prospective study investigating the therapeutic role of anagrelide in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, 20 patients received anagrelide in daily oral doses of 0.5-3 mg. 17 patients were evaluable and received anagrelide for a median of 2 years (range 0.5-4 years). No patient had a clinically appreciable benefit. Bone marrow (BM) examinations at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment were available for 17, 17 and 12 patients, respectively. In all evaluable cases, BM megakaryocyte number increased after 6 months of anagrelide treatment. Also, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 staining of megakaryocytes revealed a left-shifted maturation pattern in most patients with a platelet response to anagrelide. However, megakaryocyte staining intensity for transforming (TGF-beta) and platelet-derived (PDGF) growth factors was not affected consistently by treatment. No patient had a >/=2 grade change in either BM fibrosis or osteosclerosis. These in-vivo data support our previous in-vitro observations that anagrelide interferes with megakaryocyte maturation rather than proliferation. Lack of a positive treatment effect is consistent with the finding that anagrelide did not significantly alter megakaryocyte expression of TGF-beta and PDGF."
2008,18175944,Long-term feeding of Ginkgo biloba extract impairs peripheral circulation and hepatic function in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"We previously demonstrated that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) produces an anti-hypertensive effect via enhanced vasodilation responses in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and hepatic hypertrophy occurs with increased cytochrome P450 (CYP) mRNA expression in young rats. In the present study, to clarify whether these actions of GBE are observed in older rats, we investigated cardiovascular functions and hepatic CYP protein expressions in aged SHR fed a control diet or a diet containing 0.5% GBE for 4 weeks. In aged SHR, GBE feeding significantly increased liver weight per 100 g body weight without changing the body weight. Furthermore, significant increases in alanine aminotransferase level in serum and marked increase in CYP2B protein expression in the liver were observed in aged SHR fed GBE. On the other hand, GBE feeding did not affect blood pressure, but significantly reduced heart rate and blood flow velocity in tail arteries of aged SHR. Furthermore, GBE feeding did not affect contractile response to phenylephrine, relaxation responses to not only sodium nitroprusside but also acetylcholine, and protein levels of endothelium nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase in aortas of aged SHR. These results suggested that long-term GBE feeding impairs peripheral circulation due to bradycardia and hepatic function in aged SHR. Thus, in the elderly population with hypertension, the use of GBE may need to be assessed for effects on heart rate and liver function."
2018,30102890,Influence of the periprostatic adipose tissue in obesity-associated mouse urethral dysfunction and oxidative stress: Effect of resveratrol treatment.,"Obese mice display overactive bladder (OAB) associated with impaired urethra smooth muscle (USM) function. In this study, we evaluated the role of the adipose tissue surrounding the urethra and prostate in obese mice (here referred as periprostatic adipose tissue; PPAT) to the USM dysfunction. Male C57BL6/JUnib mice fed with either a standard-chow or high-fat diet to induce obesity were used. In PPAT, histological analysis, and qPCR analysis for gp91phox, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were conducted. In USM, concentration-response curves to contractile and relaxing agents, as well as measurements of reactive-oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) levels were performed. The higher PPAT area in obese mice was accompanied by augmented gp91phox (NOX2) and TNF-α expressions, together with decreased SOD1 expression. In USM of obese group, the contractile responses to phenylephrine and vasopressin were increased, whereas the relaxations induced with glyceryl trinitrate were reduced. The reactive-oxygen species and NO levels in USM of obese mice were increased and decreased, respectively. A higher SOD expression was also detected in obese group whilst no changes in the gp91phox levels were observed. We next evaluated the effects of the antioxidant resveratrol (100 mg/kg/day, two-weeks, PO) in the functional alterations and NO levels of obese mice. Resveratrol treatment in obese mice reversed both the functional USM dysfunction and the reduced NO production. Our data show that PPAT exerts a local inflammatory response and increases oxidative stress that lead to urethral dysfunction. Resveratrol could be an auxiliary option to prevent obesity-associated urethral dysfunction."
2018,29146334,Impact of fluorescent lighting on the browning potential of model wine solutions containing organic acids and iron.,"Model wine solutions containing organic acids, individually or combined, and iron(III), were exposed to light from fluorescent lamps or stored in darkness for four hours. (-)-Epicatechin was then added, and the solutions incubated in darkness for 10days. Browning was monitored by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry and UHPLC-DAD. The pre-irradiated solutions containing tartaric acid exhibited increased yellow/brown coloration compared to the dark controls mainly due to reaction of the tartaric acid photodegradation product glyoxylic acid with (-)-epicatechin to form xanthylium cation pigments. In these solutions, browning decreased as the concentrations of organic acids other than tartaric acid increased. Xanthylium cations were also detected in the pre-irradiated malic acid solution. However, in the malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and lactic acid solutions, any coloration was mainly due to the production of dehydrodiepicatechin A, which was largely independent of prior light exposure, but strongly affected by the organic acid present."
2013,23962855,Blood and milk oxidative status after administration of different antioxidants during early postpartum in dairy cows.,"This paper describes serum and milk oxidative profiles during early postpartum (10th-16th day) of dairy cows, after three different treatments: β-carotene and α-tocopherol (Dalmavital®, Fatro, Italy) (VAE Group); L-carnitine, d, L-acetylmethionine, cyanocobalamin (Adiuxan®, Ceva Vetem, Italy) (LCAR Group) and Dalmavital®+Adiuxan® (VAE/LCAR Group). Antioxidant administrations resulted in a general reduction in ROS concentrations which decreased more after a single drug administration (VAE and LCAR Groups) vitamin A and E serum levels increased in the three treated groups compared to control one (p < 0.05). Milk lipoperoxide content was statistically lower in treated cows than in control ones, whereas, as to vitamins, only vitamin E increased in all the treated groups compared to control. Taken together, the results of this study confirm the efficacy of antioxidant administration in the early postpartum of dairy cows and suggest that an excess in antioxidant administration may result, paradoxically, in an increase in ROS generation."
2013,23483426,Zinc and copper levels in Iranian patients with psoriasis: a case control study.,"Zinc and copper are important cofactors and modulators of many critical biological functions in many dermatological diseases including psoriasis. Studies must be performed in different societies to organize a governmental health organization nutritional program. Due to the lack of information related to these trace elements in Iranian psoriasis patients, the aim of this observational case-control study was to compare the serum zinc and copper levels and the zinc/copper ratio in psoriatic patients and healthy volunteers in Northern Iran. Zinc and copper serum concentrations were assayed in 25 selected psoriasis patients and compared with sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. The mean copper level in psoriatic patients was significantly higher than in healthy volunteers (p = 0.003), but no significant difference was observed in the zinc concentration between the two groups (p = 0.57). This study was the first one among Iranian society, and no information have been published in the field yet. The results bring some new information related to Iranian psoriatic patients in contrast to some other studies in different region so that preventive programs could be made in this regard particularly for Iranian population. With respect to the high copper concentration in the Iranian psoriatic population, using copper-chelating agents, such as penicillamine may be suggested for Iranian patients following further comprehensive investigations."
2013,24055188,Synergistic anti-proliferative effect of resveratrol and etoposide on human hepatocellular and colon cancer cell lines.,"Resveratrol is an active component of grape, which has been shown to inhibit proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells. The ability of resveratrol to enhance anti-proliferative effects of etoposide in wild type p53 liver carcinoma (HepG2) and colon cancer (HCT-116) cells was investigated with focusing on p53 activation. HepG2 cells and HCT-116 cells were treated with resveratrol and/or etoposide in a time- and dose-dependent manner and their proliferative response was evaluated by XTT assay. The expression of p53 protein was assessed using Western blot. Resveratrol exerted anti-proliferative activity on both cell types in a dose (25-100 μM)- and time (24-72 h)-dependent manner. Interestingly in HepG2 cells, resveratrol exhibited the same levels of cytotoxicity as etoposide (10 μM) when the cells treated with ≥ 25 μM for 48-72 h. In contrast to HepG2, resveratrol significantly enhanced anti-proliferative effects of etoposide in HCT-116 cells. P53 expression was up-regulated by resveratrol and etoposide and pre-incubation of both cells with resveratrol increased levels of etoposide-induced p53 expression. In line with cytotoxicity effect, combination therapy showed stronger activation of p53 in HCT-116 compared to HepG2. It seems that resveratrol exerts differential synergistic effect with etoposide on proliferation of cancer cells from different origin which is mainly accompanied by p53 activation. Our data represent a future strategy to provide much safer and more effective treatment for colon cancer."
2017,28797264,Flavonolignans inhibit the arachidonic acid pathway in blood platelets.,"Arachidonic acid metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX) is a major pathway for blood platelets' activation, which is associated with pro-thrombotic platelet activity and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Inhibition of COX activity is one of the major means of anti-platelet pharmacotherapy preventing arterial thrombosis and reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events. Recent studies have presented that a silymarin (standardized extract of Milk thistle (Silybum marianum)) can inhibit the COX pathway. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to determine the effects of three major flavonolignans (silybin, silychristin and silydianin) on COX pathway activity in blood platelets.We determined the effect of flavonolignans on arachidonic acid induced blood platelet aggregation, COX pathway metabolites formation, as well as COX activity in platelets. Additionally, we analysed the potential mechanism of this interaction using the bioinformatic ligand docking method.We observed that tested compounds decrease the platelet aggregation level, both thromboxane A2 and malondialdehyde formation, as well as inhibit the COX activity. The strongest effect was observed for silychristin and silybin. In our in silico study we showed that silychristin and silybin have conformations which interact with the active COX site as competitive inhibitors, blocking the possibility of substrate binding.The results obtained from this study clearly present the potential of flavonolignans as novel antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory agents."
2019,31158334,Notoginsenoside R1 protects human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammatory damage by up-regulation of miR-26a.,"Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is the main saponin isolated from the roots of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen (Araliaceae). This study explored the protective effects of NGR1 on human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell inflammatory damage caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as possible internal molecular mechanisms.Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was tested using DCFH-DA staining. qRT-PCR was used to measure microRNA-26a (miR-26a), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) expressions. miRNA transfection was conducted to knock down miR-26a. The protein expression levels of key molecules related to cell apoptosis, inflammatory response and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway were detected using western blotting.LPS stimulation caused human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell viability reduction, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines expression. NGR1 treatment protected human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells from LPS-caused viability reduction, ROS level elevation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines expression. Mechanistically, NGR1 enhanced miR-26a expression in LPS-treated human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Knockdown of miR-26a reversed the protective effect of NGR1 on LPS-treated cells. Besides, NGR1 inactivated NF-κB pathway in LPS-treated human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells via up-regulating miR-26a.NGR1 protected human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells from LPS-caused inflammatory damage at least partially via up-regulating miR-26a and then inactivating NF-κB pathway."
2017,28715867,Therapeutic impact of grape leaves polyphenols on certain biochemical and neurological markers in AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a grave and prevailing neurodegenerative disease, characterized by slow and progressive neurodegeneration in different brain regions. Aluminum (Al) is a potent and widely distributed neurotoxic metal, implicated in the neuropathogenesis of AD. This study aimed to evaluate the possible neurorestorative potential of Vitis vinifera Leaves Polyphenolic (VLP) extract in alleviating aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity in male rats. AlCl3 neurotoxicity induced a significant decrease in brain/serum acetylcholine (ACh) contents and serum dopamine (DA) levels, along with a significant increment of brain/serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. In addition, Al treatment resulted in significantly decreased serum levels of both total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and significantly increased serum levels of both interleukin-6 (IL-6) and total homocysteine (tHcy), as compared to control. Behavioral alterations, assessed by the T-maze test, showed impaired cognitive function. Furthermore, AD-brains revealed an increase in DNA fragmentation as evidenced by comet assay. AlCl3 induction also caused histopathological alterations in AD-brain. Treatment of AD-rats with VLP extract (100mg/kg body weight/day) improved neurobehavioral changes, as evidenced by the improvement in brain function, as well as, modulation of most biochemical markers, and confirmed by T-maze test, the histopathological study of the brain and comet assay. The current work indicates that the VLP extract has neuroprotective, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amnesic activities against AlCl3-induced cerebral damages and neurocognitive dysfunction."
2013,24292052,Comparison of inhibitory duration of grapefruit juice on organic anion-transporting polypeptide and cytochrome P450 3A4.,"Recently, a new type of interaction has been reported in which fruit juices diminish oral drug bioavailability through inhibition of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP). In this study, we aimed to clarify the duration of OATP inhibition by grapefruit juice (GFJ), and to compare it with the duration of GFJ-induced inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity. Seven healthy volunteers were enrolled in this open-label, single-sequence study. They were orally administered celiprolol (100 mg) and midazolam (15 µg/kg) with water on the control day. Three days later, they ingested GFJ (200 mL) 3 times a day for 3 d. On day 1, the same drugs were administered with GFJ. On days 3 and 7, the same drugs were administered with water. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were evaluated on each trial day. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h (AUC0-8) of celiprolol significantly decreased on day 1, and the mean ratios of these values and the corresponding control-day values were 0.18 and 0.25, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-8 returned to the control levels on days 3 and 7. In contrast, AUC0-8 of midazolam were higher on days 1 and 3 than on the control day (mean ratio, 2.12 and 1.47, respectively). The AUC0-8 returned to the control level on day 7. In conclusion, results of this study indicated that the OATP inhibition caused by GFJ dissipated faster than GFJ-mediated alterations in CYP3A4 activity, which were sustained for at least 48 h. "
2011,22005428,Effect of citrus polyphenol- and curcumin-supplemented diet on inflammatory state in obese cats.,"Among obesity-associated disorders, low-grade inflammation has been described. The putative therapeutic properties of citrus and curcumin polyphenols could be associated with their anti-inflammatory properties. Two diets supplemented either with hesperidin (0.05 %) and naringin (0.1 %) from citrus extract or with highly bioavailable curcumin from Curcuma longa extract (0.09 %) were fed to eight obese cats for two 8-week periods (cross-over study design) while maintaining animals in an obese state. Plasma acute-phase protein (APP; α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A and haptoglobin) levels were assessed before and at the end of each test period. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, transforming growth factor-β, interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA levels were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by real-time PCR. Compared with pre-study values, supplementation with citrus polyphenols resulted in lower plasma AGP and haptoglobin concentrations, while that with curcumin resulted in lower plasma AGP concentration. There were no differences between the supplementations. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, transforming growth factor-β, mRNA levels remained unaffected by either dietary supplementation. In contrast, IFN-γ and IL-2 mRNA levels were lower at the end of the citrus and the curcumin supplementation, respectively. There were no differences between the supplementations. The present study results show a slight effect of citrus and curcumin supplementation on inflammatory markers expressed by PBMC, and a decreased concentration of APP, which are mainly expressed by the liver. This would confirm that hesperidin and naringin or highly bioavailable curcumin extract have beneficial effects, targeted in the liver and could improve the obesity-related inflammatory state."
1996,8893069,"Stability of labetalol hydrochloride, metoprolol tartrate, verapamil hydrochloride, and spironolactone with hydrochlorothiazide in extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.","The stability of drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied. Labetalol hydrochloride 40 mg/mL, metoprolol tartrate 10 mg/mL, verapamil hydrochloride 50 mg/mL, and spironolactone 5 mg/mL plus hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg/ mL were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), and cherry syrup and placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The sources of the drugs were tablets. Six bottles were prepared per liquid; three were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. A sample was removed from each bottle initially and at intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. At least 91% of the initial drug concentration was retained in all the oral liquids for up to 60 days. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of the liquids, or in the pH. Labetalol hydrochloride 40 mg/mL, metoprolol tartrate 10 mg/mL, verapamil hydrochloride 50 mg/mL, plus hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg/ mL in three oral liquids compounded extemporaneously from sweetened vehicles and tablets were stable for up to 60 days when stored without light at 5 and 25 degrees C."
2006,16271437,Protection against UV-light-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 high-risk mice by sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout extracts.,"Aerobic life, UV solar radiation, genetic susceptibility, and immune status contribute collectively to the development of human skin cancers. In addition to direct DNA damage, UV radiation promotes the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates that can cause oxidative damage and inflammation, and ultimately lead to tumor formation. Treatment of murine and human keratinocytes with the isothiocyanate sulforaphane elevated phase 2 enzymes and glutathione and protected against oxidant toxicity. Topical application of sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprouts extracts induced the phase 2 response in mouse skin in vivo. Sulforaphane inhibited cytokine-dependent (gamma-interferon or lipopolysaccharide) induction of iNOS in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The UV-radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis in ""initiated high-risk mice"" was substantially inhibited by broccoli sprout extracts containing sulforaphane. After completion of the UV irradiation schedule (30 mJ/cm(2)/session twice a week for 20 weeks), groups of approximately 30 mice were treated topically on their backs (5 days a week for 11 weeks) with broccoli sprout extract containing either the equivalent to 0.3 micromol (low dose) or 1.0 micromol (high dose) sulforaphane, respectively. At this time point, the tumor incidence had reached 100% in the control mice. Tumor burden, incidence, and multiplicity were reduced by 50% in the animals that received the high dose of protector. Tumor incidence and multiplicity did not differ between the low dose-treated and the control groups, but the low dose treatment resulted in a substantial reduction of the overall tumor burden. Thus, topical application of sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout extracts is a promising strategy for protecting against skin tumor formation after exposure to UV radiation."
2010,20067468,Pro-ulcer effects of resveratrol in mice with indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers are reversed by L-arginine.,"Although resveratrol is currently being evaluated in pre-clinical studies as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent and cardiovascular stress-releasing compound, treatment with resveratrol severely delays healing of pre-existing gastric ulcers. Resveratrol treatment can also induce endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression. Here, we have attempted to modulate NO production via eNOS in order to alleviate the pro-ulcer effects of resveratrol.Gastric ulcers were induced in mice with a single dose of indomethacin. The effects of pretreatment with l-arginine on the pro-ulcer effects of resveratrol in these mice were then assessed. We measured ulcer damage scores (DS), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, generation of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and NO, along with a gene expression study.Resveratrol significantly aggravated damage from indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers, and delayed healing, as shown by increased DS and MPO activity. The mRNA for cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, but not that for COX-2, was inhibited by resveratrol treatment, with reduced synthesis of PGE(2) by gastric tissue. However, resveratrol treatment induced eNOS gene expression and shifted the eNOS/iNOS balance. l-Arginine given before resveratrol in mice with indomethacin-induced ulcers significantly increased tissue NO synthesis and improved ulcer healing.Exogenous l-arginine increased NO formation via raised levels of eNOS induced by resveratrol and protected against the pro-ulcer effects of resveratrol. Therefore, l-arginine might be useful for alleviation of the pro-ulcer side effects of resveratrol in patients."
2012,21902812,Attenuation of liver pro-inflammatory responses by Zingiber officinale via inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in high-fat diet-fed rats.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether treatment with a ginger (Zingiber officinale) extract of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats suppresses Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-driven hepatic inflammation and to subsequently explore the molecular mechanisms in vitro. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with an ethanolic extract of Zingiber officinale (400 mg/kg) along with a HFD for 6 weeks. Hepatic cytokine mRNA levels, cytokine protein levels and NF-κB activation were measured by real-time PCR, Western blot and an NF-κB nuclear translocation assay, respectively. In vitro, cell culture studies were carried out in human hepatocyte (HuH-7) cells by treatment with Zingiber officinale (100 μg/mL) for 24 hr prior to interleukin-1β (IL-1β, 8 ng/mL)-induced inflammation. We showed that Zingiber officinale treatment decreased cytokine gene TNFα and IL-6 expression in HFD-fed rats, which was associated with suppression of NF-κB activation. In vitro, Zingiber officinale treatment decreased NF-κB-target inflammatory gene expression of IL-6, IL-8 and serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), while it suppressed NF-κB activity, IκBα degradation and IκB kinase (IKK) activity. In conclusion, Zingiber officinale suppressed markers of hepatic inflammation in HFD-fed rats, as demonstrated by decreased hepatic cytokine gene expression and decreased NF-κB activation. The study demonstrates that the anti-inflammatory effect of Zingiber officinale occurs at least in part through the NF-κB signalling pathway."
2010,19732471,Fermented wheat aleurone inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.,"Fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microflora may enhance levels of SCFA, which are potentially chemoprotective against colon cancer. Functional food containing wheat aleurone may prevent cancer by influencing cell cycle and cell death. We investigated effects of fermented wheat aleurone on growth and apoptosis of HT29 cells. Wheat aleurone, flour and bran were digested and fermented in vitro. The resulting fermentation supernatants (fs) were analysed for their major metabolites (SCFA, bile acids and ammonia). HT29 cells were treated for 24-72 h with the fs or synthetic mixtures mimicking the fs in SCFA, butyrate or deoxycholic acid (DCA) contents, and the influence on cell growth was determined. Fs aleurone was used to investigate the modulation of apoptosis and cell cycle. The fermented wheat samples contained two- to threefold higher amounts of SCFA than the faeces control (blank), but reduced levels of bile acids and increased concentrations of ammonia. Fs aleurone and flour equally reduced cell growth of HT29 more effectively than the corresponding blank and the SCFA mixtures. The EC(50) (48 h) ranged from 10 % (flour) to 19 % (blank). Markedly after 48 h, fs aleurone (10 %) significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. In conclusion, fermentation of wheat aleurone results in a reduced level of tumour-promoting DCA, but higher levels of potentially chemopreventive SCFA. Fermented wheat aleurone is able to induce apoptosis and to block cell cycle - two essential markers of secondary chemoprevention."
2013,23238612,A pilot study on neopterin levels and tryptophan degradation in zinc-exposed galvanization workers.,"Hot-dip galvanization is a zinc-coating process to protect the metal items from corrosion. Zinc oxide nanoaerosol fume rising from hot metal bath surface in nano dimensions contains the greatest risk for workers in galvanization process. In the present study, it was evaluated whether inhalation of zinc causes any alteration in cellular immunity and tryptophan degradation by measuring neopterin, tryptophan, kynurenine, and zinc levels in 63 male galvanization workers and 23 male office personnel as controls. Serum and urinary zinc levels were found as 102.43 ± 4.74 and 0.66 ± 0.05 μg/dL in workers while 75.45 ± 4.24 and 0.80 ± 0.08 μg/dL [corrected] in controls, respectively (both, p < 0.05). Similarly, the mean urinary neopterin levels and serum neopterin and kynurenine levels were found to be statistically higher in galvanization workers than the controls (all, p < 0.05). Significant correlations were found between urinary neopterin levels and kynurenine to tryptophan ratio or serum zinc levels. The results indicated cellular immune activation by occupational zinc exposure. It was estimated that neopterin, in parallel with kynurenine pathway, could reflect occupational exposure to zinc nanoaerosols and might be useful in early diagnosis of immune alterations due to nano-scale exposures."
2011,20849668,The capacity of foodstuffs to induce innate immune activation of human monocytes in vitro is dependent on food content of stimulants of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4.,"The ingestion of fatty meals is associated with a transient, low-grade systemic inflammatory response in human subjects, involving the activation of circulating monocytes and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it is not yet clear how different foodstuffs may promote inflammatory signalling. In a screen of forty filter-sterilised soluble extracts from common foodstuffs, seven were found to induce the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 from human monocytes in vitro. To investigate what may differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory food extracts, stimulants of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 were quantified using human embryonic kidney-293 cells transfected with each TLR, and calibrated with defined bacterial lipopeptide (BLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) standards. These assays revealed that while most foods contained undetectable levels of TLR2 or TLR4 stimulants, all TNF-α-inducing foods contained stimulants of either TLR2 (up to 1100 ng BLP-equivalent/g) or TLR4 (up to 2700 ng LPS-equivalent/g) in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. TLR stimulants were present mainly in meat products and processed foods, but were minimal or undetectable in fresh fruit and vegetables. The capacity of food extracts to induce TNF-α secretion in monocytes correlated with the content of both TLR2 (r 0·837) and TLR4 stimulants (r 0·748), and was completely abolished by specific inhibition of TLR2 and TLR4. LPS and BLP were found to be highly resistant to typical cooking times and temperatures, low pH and protease treatment. In conclusion, apparently unspoiled foodstuffs can contain large quantities of stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4, both of which may regulate their capacity to stimulate inflammatory signalling."
2002,11853172,Inhibitory mechanism of an extract of Althaea officinalis L. on endothelin-1-induced melanocyte activation.,"It is known that expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) increases in the epidermis after UVB irradiation, and that this plays an important role during the induction of pigmentation both as a mitogen and as a melanogen for normal human melanocytes (NHMC). When ET-1 acts on NHMC via the endothelin B receptor (ET(B)R) on their cell surface, mobilization of intracellular calcium is induced, which is followed by activation of Raf-1 located upstream of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). We have continued the search for new agent which inhibit this calcium mobilization and we have found that an extract of Althaea officinalis L. has such an action. In this study, we investigated the precise inhibitory mechanism of this botanical extract on the ET-1-induced activation of melanocytes. Treatment of NHMC with this extract abrogated the stimulatory effect of ET-1 on proliferation and also on activation of MAPK in the intracellular signal transduction pathway, but did not affect the binding of ET-1 to the ET(B)R or the production of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate (IP3). Further, when this extract was used to treat normal human keratinocytes (NHKC), secretion of ET-1 by those cells was reduced. Taken together, these findings indicate that an extract of A. officinalis inhibits both the secretion of ET-1 from NHKC and the action of ET-1 on NHMC mainly by suppressing the ET-1-induced calcium mobilization without the modification of IP3 production, which in turn suggests that this extract is a useful ingredient for a whitening agent."
2016,26616992,Preparation of tyrosinase inhibitors and antibrowning agents using green technology.,"Chalcones and their derivatives have attracted great interests in recent years for their comprehensive biological activities. In this study, 2,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone and its two derivatives, 1,3,5-tris-(2,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)pentane-1,5-dione (new compound) and 7,2',4'-trihydroxyflavanone, were synthesized through one-pot green procedure catalyzed by boric acid in polyethylene glycol 400. Their structures were identified by ESI-MS and NMR spectral. Tyrosinase inhibitory activity and antibrowning test results showed that compounds 1-3 exhibited strong tyrosinase inhibitory activities and significant antibrowning effects on the fresh-cut lotus root slices at room temperature in 48 h. Among them, 0.01% 1,3,5-tris-(2,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)pentane-1,5-dione combined with 0.5% VC showed the best antibrowning ability. In brief, this study offers a protocol for one-pot green synthesis of high efficiency tyrosinase inhibitors which may be suitable as antibrowning agents for fresh-cut vegetables. More important, this study developed a new type of 1,5-dione derivative which may serve as new lead structures for novel tyrosinase inhibitors discovery."
2019,30423313,Isoform-specific therapeutic control of sulfonation in humans.,"The activities of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of metabolites are regulated by human cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) - a 13-member family of disease relevant enzymes that catalyze transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (-SO3) from PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfonate) to the hydroxyls and amines of acceptors. SULTs harbor two independent allosteric sites, one of which, the focus of this work, binds non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The structure of the first NSAID-binding site - that of SULT1A1 - was elucidated recently and homology modeling suggest that variants of the site are present in all SULT isoforms. The objective of the current study was to assess whether the NSAID-binding site can be used to regulate sulfuryl transfer in humans in an isoform specific manner. Mefenamic acid (Mef) is a potent (Ki 27 nM) NSAID-inhibitor of SULT1A1 - the predominant SULT isoform in small intestine and liver. Acetaminophen (APAP), a SULT1A1 specific substrate, is extensively sulfonated in humans. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is specific for SULT2A1, which we show here is insensitive to Mef inhibition. APAP and DHEA sulfonates are readily quantified in urine and thus the effects of Mef on APAP and DHEA sulfonation could be studied non-invasively. Compounds were given orally in a single therapeutic dose to a healthy, adult male human with a typical APAP-metabolite profile. Mef profoundly decreased APAP sulfonation during first pass metabolism and substantially decreased systemic APAP sulfonation without influencing DHEA sulfonation; thus, it appears the NSAID site can be used to control sulfonation in humans in a SULT-isoform specific manner."
2011,21788102,Anti-angiogenic effect of Tanshinone IIA involves inhibition of matrix invasion and modification of MMP-2/TIMP-2 secretion in vascular endothelial cells.,"Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is one of the major lipophilic components of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge reported to exhibit anti-carcinogenic effect. In the present study, we further evaluated the anti-angiogenic effect of Tan IIA using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in chicken embryos and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Tan IIA was confirmed to inhibit in vivo angiogenesis by CAM assay. Tan IIA also exhibited in vitro anti-angiogenic effects as demonstrated by tube formation assay, transwell migration assay and TNF-α-induced matrix invasion assay. The mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2, -3, -9, -14 (MMP-2, -3, -9, -14), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) were not affected by Tan IIA as analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity was found to be reduced dose-dependently by Tan IIA as determined by gelatin zymography. Results from western blot analysis and ELISA further demonstrated the dose-dependent decrease of MMP-2 and increase of TIMP-2 secretion from cytosol of vascular endothelial cells simultaneously after Tan IIA treatment. Together, the present study confirmed the anti-angiogenic effects of Tan IIA both in vivo and in vitro. Our results also demonstrated that Tan IIA could modulate the secretion of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in an opposite way and resulted in the decreased MMP-2 activity of vascular endothelial cells."
2009,18983991,Pharmacodynamic interaction of Momordica charantia with rosiglitazone in rats.,"The present study was undertaken to determine the interaction of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist with methanolic extract of Momordica charantia L (MC), an herbal drug used widely as an antidiabetic agent. The pharmacodynamic interaction was evaluated in oral glucose tolerance test, streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes in adult rats and STZ induced diabetes in neonatal rats. Rosiglitazone was given orally at two different doses of 2mg/kg and 5mg/kg and MC was administered at a dose of 500 mg/kg, p.o. The serum glucose level estimation and histopathological studies of pancreas, liver and kidney were carried out. Both rosiglitazone and MC showed hypoglycaemic effect in oral glucose tolerance test. The hypoglycaemic effect observed with combination of rosiglitazone and MC was significantly more compared to either of the drugs given alone. MC also augmented the hypoglycaemic effect of rosiglitazone in both STZ induced diabetes in adult animals and STZ induced diabetes in neonatal rats. Histopathological studies revealed that administration of rosiglitazone with MC increased the volume of islet cell in pancreas and prevented the hepatic damage when compared to control. It was concluded that MC augments hypoglycaemic effect of rosiglitazone. This could be important in reducing the dose of rosiglitazone to achieve enhanced therapeutic effect with minimal adverse effects."
2016,26198133,"Effects of Different Zinc Species on Cellar Zinc Distribution, Cell Cycle, Apoptosis and Viability in MDAMB231 Cells.","Intracellular metal elements exist in mammalian cells with the concentration range from picomoles per litre to micromoles per litre and play a considerable role in various biological procedures. Element provided by different species can influence the availability and distribution of the element in a cell and could lead to different biological effects on the cell's growth and function. Zinc as an abundant and widely distributed essential trace element, is involved in numerous and relevant physiological functions. Zinc homeostasis in cells, which is regulated by metallothioneins, zinc transporter/SLC30A, Zrt-/Irt-like proteins/SLC39A and metal-response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1), is crucial for normal cellular functioning. In this study, we investigated the influences of different zinc species, zinc sulphate, zinc gluconate and bacitracin zinc, which represented inorganic, organic and biological zinc species, respectively, on cell cycle, viability and apoptosis in MDAMB231 cells. It was found that the responses of cell cycle, apoptosis and death to different zinc species in MDAMB231 cells are different. Western blot analysis of the expression of several key proteins in regulating zinc-related transcription, cell cycle, apoptosis, including MTF-1, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in treated cells further confirmed the observed results on cell level.

2008,18521548,Mechanism of iodine uptake by cabbage: effects of iodine species and where it is stored.,"Iodine-enhanced vegetable has been proven to be an effective way to reduce iodine deficiency disorders in many regions. However, the knowledge about what mechanisms control plant uptake of iodine and where iodine is stored in plants is still very limited. A series of controlled experiments, including solution culture, pot planting, and field experiments were carried out to investigate the uptake mechanism of iodine in different forms. A new methodology for observing the iodine distribution within the plant tissues, based on AgI precipitation reaction and transmission electron microscope techniques, has been developed and successfully applied to Chinese cabbage. Results show that iodine uptake by Chinese cabbage was more effective when iodine was in the form of IO(3) (-) than in the form of I(-) if the concentration was low (<0.5 mg L(-1)), but the trend was opposite if iodine concentration was 0.5 mg L(-1) or higher. The uptake was more sensitive to metabolism inhibitor in lower concentration of iodine, which implies that the uptake mechanism transits from active to passive as the iodine concentration increases, especially when the iodine is in the form of IO(3) (-). The inorganic iodine fertilizer provided a quicker supply for plant uptake, but the higher level of iodine was toxic to plant growth. The organic iodine fertilizer (seaweed composite) provided a more sustainable iodine supply for plants. Most of the iodine uptake by the cabbage is intercepted and stored in the fibrins in the root while the iodine that is transported to the above-ground portion (shoots and leaves) is selectively stored in the chloroplasts."
2004,15569272,Enzymatic oxidation of 2-phenylethylamine to phenylacetic acid and 2-phenylethanol with special reference to the metabolism of its intermediate phenylacetaldehyde.,"2-phenylethylamine is an endogenous constituent of the human brain and is implicated in cerebral transmission. This bioactive amine is also present in certain foodstuffs such as chocolate, cheese and wine and may cause undesirable side effects in susceptible individuals. Metabolism of 2-phenylethylamine to phenylacetaldehyde is catalysed by monoamine oxidase B but the oxidation to its acid is usually ascribed to aldehyde dehydrogenase and the contribution of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, if any, is ignored. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the molybdenum hydroxylases, aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, in the metabolism of phenylacetaldehyde derived from its parent biogenic amine. Treatments of 2-phenylethylamine with monoamine oxidase were carried out for the production of phenylacetaldehyde, as well as treatments of synthetic or enzymatic-generated phenylacetaldehyde with aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The results indicated that phenylacetaldehyde is metabolised mainly to phenylacetic acid with lower concentrations of 2-phenylethanol by all three oxidising enzymes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase was the predominant enzyme involved in phenylacetaldehyde oxidation and thus it has a major role in 2-phenylethylamine metabolism with aldehyde oxidase playing a less prominent role. Xanthine oxidase does not contribute to the oxidation of phenylacetaldehyde due to low amounts being present in guinea pig. Thus aldehyde dehydrogenase is not the only enzyme oxidising xenobiotic and endobiotic aldehydes and the role of aldehyde oxidase in such reactions should not be ignored."
1992,1642684,Effect of cefodizime on parameters of cell-mediated immunity in vitro.,"A positive effect of cefodizime (CAS 69739-16-8), a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, on a number of immunological variables, and in particular phagocytosis, was demonstrated in several test systems. The aim of the present investigation was to establish whether clinically relevant concentrations of cefodizime affect cell-mediated immune variables. Peripheral lymphocytes from healthy subjects were isolated and incubated with cefodizime in increasing concentrations from 0 to 200 mg/l. The effects of cefodizime on membrane-bound antigenic determinants of the lymphocytes were determined in the rosette inhibition test, and its effects on the proliferative capacity of lymphocytes after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen were determined in the lymphocyte transformation test. Cefodizime inhibited rosette formation in a concentration dependent manner. A direct inhibitory effect on proliferation was not, however, demonstrated in the lymphocyte transformation test. Indeed, stimulation of mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation, particularly of concanavalin A-sensitive cells was observed at concentrations higher than 100 mg/l. The findings in healthy volunteers were reproduced in samples from three female patients with impaired host-defence. These results may suggest a positive effect of cefodizime on the proliferative capacity of the cellular immune system. However, no conclusions can be drawn on the clinical relevance of these findings until the results of in vivo investigations are available."
2011,21447053,Resveratrol impairs the release of steroid-resistant cytokines from bacterial endotoxin-exposed alveolar macrophages in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is believed to be insensitive to corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are recommended in COPD (GOLD stages III, IV) with frequent exacerbations. Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory properties and could be an alternative to corticosteroids in COPD therapy. We investigated the effect of dexamethasone versus resveratrol on the release of COPD-related inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF and MCP-1) and matrix-metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) from alveolar macrophages exposed to gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). We compared never-smokers, current smokers without airway obstruction and current smokers with COPD. The cytokines and MMP-9 were measured in cell culture supernatants with ELISA. The release of IL-8 and MMP-9 from LPS-exposed alveolar macrophages was increased in COPD, the release of GM-CSF and IL-6 was decreased in COPD and the release of MCP-1 was without differences between the cohorts. Dexamethasone impaired the release of all cytokines and MMP-9 from LPS-exposed alveolar macrophages of all cohorts, but for IL-8 and GM-CSF this effect was reduced in COPD. In alveolar macrophages of COPD, there was an almost complete reduction in IL-6 release but only a partial reduction in IL-8, GM-CSF, MCP-1 and MMP-9 release demonstrating a partial corticosteroid-insensitivity. In contrast, resveratrol almost completely reduced the release of all cytokines and MMP-9 without significant differences between the cohorts. Our data provide evidence for a corticosteroid resistance of alveolar macrophage-dependent inflammatory responses induced by gram-negative bacteria in COPD and thus question the utility of corticosteroids in COPD therapy. Instead, resveratrol may prove an alternative."
2010,20944433,"Volatile attractants for the common bluebottle, Graphium sarpedon nipponum, from the host, Cinnamomum camphora.","Floral scent has been shown to elicit behavioral responses by butterflies which forage for flowers after receiving appropriate signals. In comparison with investigations about the role of floral scent, those of foliar odor are, however, very few. In this study, the foliar volatiles of Cinnamomum camphora (Lauraceae), which had been collected by air entrainment, exhibited activities toward Graphium sarpedon nipponum (Papilionidae) in both electrophysiological and behavioral tests. The volatiles were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography with electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD). Two electrophysiological active compounds were found which were determined as nonanal and decanal by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Female butterflies generally tend to show a greater EAG response than males to the headspace volatiles and EAG-active aldehydes. Two EAG-active aldehydes were found in attractant tests to be attractive to both sexes of the butterfly when treated individually. Although the difference between the sexes was not significant, the female butterflies' preference tended to be more active than that of the males."
,463946,Lack of effect of mealtime wine on the hypoprothrombinemia of oral anticoagulants.,"To evaluate the effect of mealtime wine of the hypoprothrombinemic effect of anticoagulant therapy, eight normal subjects were anticoagulated at therapeutic levels for 21 days. Eight experiments were performed with racemic warfarin alone, 7 with warfarin plus a total of 10 oz mealtime wine per day ingested, and 6 with warfarin plus a total of 20 oz wine  per day. Each subject served as his own control. After day 3, the average one-stage prothrombin activity was 33%, 33%, and 32% and the average warfarin level was 2.9, 2.9, and 3.1 microgram/ml for warfarin alone, warfarin plus 10 oz of wine, and warfarin plus 20 oz of wine, respectively. It is concluded that 10 and even 20 oz of daily mealtime wine has no effect on therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia."

The objective of this prospective, intent-to-treat, phase IV study was to determine the therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness of zinc gluconate glycine lozenges (Cold-Eeze) for the common cold. Zinc lozenges were administered once daily during the cold season for prophylaxis. For therapeutic purposes, lozenges were given 4 times per day. The primary objective of the study was the treatment effect on cold duration, and the secondary objective was the effect on the number of common colds. A putative control from our previous study was used for comparison. A total of 178 children, ages 12 to 18 years, was enrolled, of which 134 met criteria for efficacy analysis. The average cold duration with therapeutic lozenge use was 6.9 +/- 3.1 days, significantly shorter than the 9.0 +/- 3.5 days found in the control group (P < 0.001). The mean number of colds was 1.28 +/- 1.03 with zinc lozenge prophylaxis versus 1.7 +/- 1.91 without prophylaxis (P < 0.05), a 25% reduction. With prophylaxis, 25% of the subjects did not experience a cold and two-thirds never had a cold or only had 1 cold. There was no antibiotic use for any cold, and there were no adverse events reported. Results of this study are consistent with those from our previous retrospective study showing significantly shorter cold duration and fewer colds with the use of zinc gluconate glycine lozenges. The zinc gluconate glycine lozenges are well tolerated and are an easy-to-administer therapy that has the potential to substantially reduce cold-related school absences and antibiotic use and misuse as well as to provide a cost saving."
1998,9566716,Screening of edible Japanese plants for nitric oxide generation inhibitory activities in RAW 264.7 cells.,"A total of 48 (60 test samples) species of plants commonly eaten in Japan were randomly collected and their methanol extracts were tested for in vitro nitric oxide (NO) generation inhibitory activities in a murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, stimulated with both lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, 100 U/ml). Seventeen (28.3%) of the 48 extracts strongly inhibited NO generation at a concentration of 200 microg/ml by 70% or more with significant cell viability (>50%). The extracts from avocado, taro, red turnip, sereves, komatsuna, basil, mitsuba and Chinese mustard markedly inhibited iNOS activity. These results suggest that a wide variety of edible plants in Japan contain the secondary metabolites carrying cancer preventive activity through reduction of excess amounts of NO."
2019,31454852,Resveratrol suppresses the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis formation in kidneys via proliferation-related signalling pathways.,"Renal fibrosis acts as the common pathway leading to the development of end-stage renal disease. Previous studies have shown that resveratrol has anti-fibrotic activity, but its potential molecular mechanisms of action are not well understood.The anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol were assayed in a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in vivo and in fibroblasts and tubular epithelial cells (TECs) stimulated by TGF-β1 in vitro. Gene and protein expression levels were analysed by PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining.Resveratrol inhibits the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis formation in UUO kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol correlated with decreased proliferation of TECs in the interstitium and tubules, resulting in suppressed activity of the proliferation-related signalling pathways, including that of the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK2/STAT3 pathways. Resveratrol treatment suppressed TGF-β1-induced FMD and the expression of the myofibroblastic phenotype in fibroblasts in vitro by antagonizing the activation of proliferation-related signalling. Similarly, TGF-β1-mediated overactivation of the proliferation-related signalling in TECs induced EMT, and the myofibroblastic phenotype was suppressed by resveratrol. The anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol were associated with the inactivation of Smad2/3 signalling and resulted in a partial reversal of FMD and EMT and the inhibition of the myofibroblastic phenotype.Resveratrol suppresses the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis formation in vivo and in vitro via proliferation-related pathways, making it a potential therapeutic agent for preventing renal fibrosis."
1990,2284572,Fusidic acid treatment of HIV infection: no significant effect in a pilot trial.,"22 HIV-positive homosexual men were treated with fusidic acid tablets (500 mg t.i.d.) for a period of 2-12 months (mean 71/2). At entry, all had a CD4-count less than 500 X 10(6)/l, and/or a pokeweed mitogen lymphocyte proliferation response of less than 50% of 2 normal controls, and no overt opportunistic infections. No significant immunological changes were observed and no definite beneficial clinical effect. On the 10th-13th day of treatment, 12 of the patients developed fever and an itchy exanthema. The symptoms disappeared spontaneously in 9 patients. No hematological or biochemical side effects were seen. Thus, in this pilot study of fusidic acid therapy of HIV-infected men, no significant effect could be detected."
2012,22389052,Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart valves.,"Cardioembolic strokes account for one-sixth of all strokes and are an important potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) are effective for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and in those with mechanical heart valves but because of their inherent limitations are underutilized and often suboptimally managed. Antiplatelet therapies have been the only alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF but although they are safer and more convenient they are much less efficacious. The advent of new oral anticoagulant drugs offers the potential to reduce the burden of cardioembolic stroke by providing access to effective, safe, and more convenient therapies. New oral anticoagulants have begun to replace warfarin for stroke prevention in some patients with AF, based on the favorable results of recently completed phase III randomized controlled trials, and provide for the first time an alternative to antiplatelet therapy for patients deemed unsuitable for warfarin. The promise of the new oral anticoagulants in patients with mechanical heart valves is currently being tested in a phase II trial. If efficacy and safety are demonstrated, the new oral anticoagulants will provide an alternative to warfarin for patients with mechanical heart valves and may also lead to increased use of mechanical valves for patients who would not have received them in the past because of the requirement for long term warfarin therapy."
2000,10858868,Biochemical activities of extracts from Hypericum perforatum L. 5th communication: dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-product quantification by HPLC and inhibition by hypericins and flavonoids.,"Extracts from the herb ""St. John's wort"" (Hypericum perforatum L.) exhibit beneficial effects on patients suffering from mental depressions. Lack of catecholamine neurotransmitters may be one biochemical mechanism for this problem under discussion. It has been recently reported that alcoholic extracts from Hypericum perforatum inhibit dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (D-beta-H) with an I50 of 0.1 mumol/l on the basis of total hypericin content and with an I50 of 21 mumol/l with pure commercial hypericin. As test system polarographic determination of oxygen uptake with tyramine as a substrate analogue was used. In the present paper the quantification of the enzymatic activity and the potential influence of inhibitors are reported using dopamine as substrate and product (noradrenaline) quantification by HPLC. With this test system it could be shown that D-beta-H is strongly inhibited by pseudohypericin (I50 = approx. 3 mumol/l) and hypericin (I50 = approx. 5 mumol/l), whereas the I50-values of various flavonoids (quercitrin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, rutin, quercetin, amentoflavone, kaempferol) are in the range of 50 mumol/l or higher."
2006,16039042,In vitro antileukaemic activity of extracts from berry plant leaves against sensitive and multidrug resistant HL60 cells.,"The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro antileukaemic activity of extracts obtained from selected berry plant leaves (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. cv Elsanta, raspberry Rubus ideus L. cv Polana and blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. cv Bluecrop) against promyelocytic HL60 cell line and its multidrug resistant sublines exhibiting two different MDR phenotypes: HL60/VINC (overexpressing P-glycoprotein) and HL60/DOX (overexpressing MRP1 protein). It was found that the blueberry extract was the most efficient against sensitive HL60 cell line (about 2-fold more active than strawberry and raspberry extracts) but presented much lower activity towards resistant cells. In contrast, strawberry and raspberry extracts exhibited the high cytotoxic activity against sensitive leukaemia HL60 cell line as well as its MDR sublines. The values of resistance factor (RF) found for these extracts were very low lying in the range 0.32/2.0."
2011,20813795,Protective effects of thymoquinone against methotrexate-induced testicular injury.,"Thymoquinone is the major active component derived from Nigella sativa. Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used in clinic. Aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of thymoquinone on testicular toxicity of methotrexate. Experiments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks old, 20 ± 2 g). The animals were divided into four groups with six mice in each group. Equivalent volumes of saline were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) in the control group. In the thymoquinone group, mice received thymoquinone i.p. with a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Mice in the methotrexate group received single dose of methotrexate i.p., with a dose of 20 mg/kg. Finally, in the methotrexate plus thymoquinone group, in the first and the following 3 days after methotrexate administration, thymoquinone was injected with a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, i.p. At the end of the experiment, the left testis was quickly removed and divided into two parts for histological examination and biochemical analysis. Methotrexate alone increased total antioxidant capacity and myeloperoxidase activity compared to the controls. Thymoquinone treatment decreased total antioxidant capacity and prevented the increase in the myeloperoxidase activity. Light microscopy showed in mice that receiving methotrexate resulted in interstitial space dilatation, edema, severe disruption of the seminiferous epithelium and reduced diameter of the seminiferous tubules. Administration of thymoquinone reversed histological changes of methotrexate significantly. We suggest that thymoquinone use may decrease the destructive effects of methotrexate on testicular tissue of patients using this agent."
2005,16353966,Licorice: a possible anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer drug.,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the anti-inflammatory activities of both glycerrhitinic acid (GA) and the aqueous licorice extract (ALE) in comparison with diclofenac sodium (DS) (10 mg/kg), using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model in male albino rats. In addition, the anti-ulcer activities of ALE, famotidine (FT), and a combination of ALE and FT using indomethacin-induced ulceration technique in rat stomach were investigated. Conventional DS tablets containing GA, as well as DS chewable tablets containing either GA or ALE with different tastes were prepared. Also, rapidly disintegrating FT tablets were prepared using direct compression and camphor sublimation methods. ALE or GA produced significant anti-inflammatory activity similar to DS, and when taken concomitantly, there is no possible antagonism. The anti-ulcer activity of licorice was found to be similar to that of FT in indomethacin-induced ulceration technique in rat stomach. Combination therapy of both FT and licorice showed higher anti-ulcer activity than either of them alone. Generally, tablets containing the crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (AcDisol) showed more rapidly disintegrating effect than those including Sodium starch glycolate (Primojel). The oral disintegration was very rapid for all the tested formulations. Also, the amount of FT absorbed from the oral cavity was nearly 9 from 10 mg theoretically present in each formula. It could be concluded that both GA and ALE have anti-inflammatory activity comparable with DS. It may be recommended to add ALE to either FT or diclofinac for more effective anti-inflammatory or anti-ulcer formulations, respectively."
2018,30275799,Antibacterial and Antibiotic-Potentiating Activities of Thirteen Cameroonian Edible Plants against Gram-Negative Resistant Phenotypes.,"This work was designed to investigate the antibacterial activities of methanol extracts from thirteen Cameroonian edible plants and their antibiotic-potentiating effects against Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extracts, as well as their antibiotic-potentiating activities. The phytochemical screening of the extracts was carried out according to the standard methods. The results of phytochemical tests revealed the presence of sterols, polyphenols, and tannins in most of the tested extracts, with the other classes of secondary metabolites being selectively distributed. Tested extracts showed variable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 64 to 1024 μg/mL. However, some extracts were significantly active against certain bacterial strains: seeds extract of Theobroma cacao (64 μg/mL) against Escherichia coli AG100Atet and Klebsiella pneumoniae K24, and the bark extract of Uapaca guineensis against E. coli ATCC 8739. The leaves extract of T. cacao displayed the best MBC values (256 μg/mL) against E. aerogenes EA27. Some tested extracts included extracts from the leaves of T. cacao and P. vulgaris, and the seeds of D. edulis and barks A. indica has selectively improved (2- to 64-fold) the antibacterial activities of some of the tested antibiotics, chloramphenicol (CHL), tetracycline (TET), kanamycin (KAN), streptomycin (STR), and erythromycin (ERY), against more than 70% of tested MDR bacteria. The findings of this work showed that tested plant extracts and particularly those from T. cacao and Phaseolus vulgaris can be used alone or in combination with conventional antibiotics in the treatment of infections involving multiresistant bacteria."
2017,28323626,Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Seed Oil for Treating Menopausal Symptoms: An Individually Controlled Cohort Study.,"Context • In the folk medicine of Mediterranean countries and in ancient Ayurveda, Punica granatum seeds (ie, pomegranate seeds) have been used for treatment of various disorders, including those that nowadays are classified as menopausal symptoms (MSs). Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) from those seeds mainly contains unsaturated fatty acids such as γ-linoleic acid and linolenic acid, but it also includes phytoestrogens. It is, therefore, regarded as a promising option for treating MSs today. Objectives • The study intended to investigate the safety and effectiveness of PSO as a defined P granatum seed oil for patients with MSs. Design • The research team designed an individually controlled, investigator-initiated cohort study. Setting • The treatments were performed at 2 institutions: (1) the Center for Complementary Medicine at the University Medical Center Freiburg (Freiburg, Germany); and (2) in the medical practice of H. Fischer (Freiburg, Germany). Participants • Seventy-eight patients, who had a mean duration of MSs of 46 mo, participated in the study. Intervention • After 4 wk without treatment, which functioned as a period providing an individual control, each participant took 1000 mg of PSO daily in 2 capsules for 8 wk. Outcome Measures • The symptom severity was scored on the German version of the menopausal rating scale (MRS) at baseline, after 4 wk without treatment, after 4 wk of treatment, and postintervention, with 0 = absence of symptoms and 4 = very strong symptoms. The efficacy and tolerability were estimated on scales from 0-4. Each participant's 17ß estradiol was determined at baseline and after postintervention using the patient's sera. The content of the β-sitosterol was determined in the PSO preparations by gas chromatography. Results • The content of β-sitosterol in the PSO used in the study was 6.3 mg/1000 mg. In the intention to treat analysis, most MRS symptoms were significantly and relevantly reduced (eg, hot flushes changed from 2.32 ± 1.04 to 1.41 ± 1.07, P < .001). Remarkably, urogenital tract symptoms (ie, a dry vagina) also significantly improved, moving from 1.32 ± 1.43 to 0.85 ± 1.19, P < .001. Few patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The tolerability was excellent at 3.69 ± 0.71 after 4 wk of treatment and 3.71 ± 0.65 after 8 wk of treatment. The 17ß estradiol was unchanged. Conclusions • Participants showed significant improvements in all domains of the MRS, remarkably including the difficult-to-treat urogenital symptoms. No changes occurred in the 17ß-estradiol in patients' sera after the PSO treatment. The results are promising and encourage the investigation of PSO rich in β-sitosterol for treatment of MSs in placebo-controlled studies."
2016,26066525,"Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Antioxidant Defenses and Oxidative Stress Markers in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy for Colorectal Cancer: a Placebo-Controlled, Prospective Randomized Trial.","The study aimed to investigate the effect of oral zinc supplementation on antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress markers during chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Twenty-four patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer participated in this placebo-controlled, prospective randomized study. The supplementation was started in the perioperative period, in which 10 patients received 70 mg of zinc (zinc group, n = 10) and 14 patients received placebo (placebo group, n = 14) for 16 weeks. Approximately 45 days after surgical resection of tumor, all patients received a chemotherapeutic regimen (capecitabine, capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil). Vitamin C, vitamin E, antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and lipid peroxidation markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-isoprostane were determined before the first, second, third, and fourth chemotherapy cycles. Compared with the placebo group, the zinc group presented higher SOD values before the first, second, and fourth chemotherapy cycles and lower GPx values before the third cycle. There were no statistical differences between the study groups in vitamin C, vitamin E, MDA, or 8-isoprostane plasma values. Longitudinal analysis revealed decreased vitamin E concentration in the placebo group before the second and fourth cycles as compared with the initial values. Zinc supplementation during chemotherapy cycles increased SOD activity and maintained vitamin E concentrations. Although no effect of zinc supplementation on oxidative stress markers was observed, the increase in SOD activity indicates a production of stable free radicals, which may have a positive effect in cancer treatment.

1986,3752932,Estimation of minerals and trace elements provided by beverages for the adult in France.,"The total average amount of beverages absorbed daily (1,378 ml) is split up as follows: tap water (650 ml where from 170 ml are used for the preparation of coffee and tea); bottled water (190 ml); alcoholic drinks (481 ml) and soft drinks (57 ml). Under these conditions, the intake is estimated at (mg/day): Na: 50, K: 450, P: 83, Ca: 141, Mg: 54, Fe: 2.9, Zn: 0.64, Cu: 0.46, Mn: 0.40, F: 0.64, I: 0.09, Cr: 0.013, Se: 0.031. The most significant supplies for both quantity and quality are those of calcium (18% of the needs), iron (29%), copper (19%), fluorine (24%) and magnesium (16%) for the adult. Alcoholic drinks represent 35% of the daily intake of beverages; they are likewise the main source of minerals such as: iodine and iron (wine), selenium (beer), fluorine, calcium and copper (in all alcoholic drinks). Calcium and fluorine are the main minerals provided by the different types of water. We have shown the influence of the geographical origin of the tap water on the Ca and F intake, as well as the influence of individual behaviour with respect to the selection of his main drink."
2004,15498518,A novel therapy for acute hepatitis utilizing dehydroepiandrosterone in the murine model of hepatitis.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), one of the major androgens secreted by the adrenal cortex, has been shown to have potential immunoreguratory properties. In this study, we examined the effect of DHEA in a mouse model of hepatitis. Mice were treated with DHEA and injected with concanavalin A (Con A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (GalN). Cytokine expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. Apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL method and by DNA fragmentation analysis. In the DHEA-treated mice, the serum levels of ALT and expression of inflammatory mediators were significantly decreased. The number of apoptotic cells was also much lower than that observed in control, untreated mouse liver tissue. There were fewer tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced apoptotic cells in H4IIE hepatoma cells treated with DHEA than in non-treated cells. DHEA decreased the expression levels of mRNA transcripts encoding TNF-alpha and iNOS. These results suggest that DHEA can reduce T-cell-mediated injury in the liver as manifest by inhibition of the expression of several inflammatory mediators and hepatocyte apoptosis. DHEA should, thus, be considered as a novel candidate for the therapy of liver injury."
2013,23517616,"The anti-inflammatory potential of phenolic compounds in grape juice concentrate (G8000™) on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis.","Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is characterised by an up-regulation of the synthesis and release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators leading to excessive tissue injury. Flavonoids are able to inhibit enzymes and/or due to their antioxidant properties regulate the immune response. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds present in grape juice on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. A total of forty-one male Wistar rats were randomised into seven groups: negative control group; TNBS non-treated induced colitis; 2% grape juice control group; 1% grape juice 24 h after TNBS colitis induction; 1% grape juice on day 7 after colitis induction; 2% grape juice 24 h after colitis induction; 2% grape juice on day 7 after colitis induction. The 1% grape juice-treated induced colitis group showed marked clinical improvement when compared with the TNBS-induced colitis group. Rats that received 1% grape juice, on day 7 after colitis induction, presented reduced intensity of macroscopic and histological scores. Statistically significant differences (P,0·05) of TNF-a and inducible NO synthase mRNA expression were detected in the groups treated with grape juice at the 1% dose after inducing experimental colitis when compared with the TNBS group. Grape juice reduced the noxious effects induced by colitis caused by TNBS, especially at the 1% dose."
2000,11304646,Homocysteine and arteriosclerosis: established risk factor or new illusion?,"Homocysteine is an amino acid and a product of methionine metabolism that is metabolized through two different enzymatic pathways: transsulfuration and remethylation. Vitamin B6 is important in homocysteine transsulfuration, whereas folate and vitamin B12 play significant roles in homocysteine remethylation. The hyperhomocysteinemia offers an explanation for observations on human arteriosclerosis that are difficult to explain by the cholesterol/fat approach. However, hyperhomocysteinemia can influence cognitive functions in the elderly. The causes of hyperhomocysteinemia are inherited and acquired. The treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia varies with underlying cause; generally, vitamin supplementation (with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12) is effective in reducing homocysteine concentrations. Also, specific recommendations, food fortification with folic acid, and preventive strategies in European countries (as in United States) are necessary to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
,21863748,[The influence of vitamin B group on monooxygenase activity of cytochrome P450 3A4: pharmacokinetics and electro analysis of catalytic properties].,"It was shown that vitamin B group permit to shorten the longitude of diclofenak therapy and to reduce the daytime dose of this drug. All three schemes of diclofenac treatment - only diclofenac, diclofenac plus 2 tablets of Gitagamp (mixture of vitamin B group), and diclofenac plus 4 tablets of Gitagamp--gave maximum value of diclofenal in blood through 1 hour after treatment. In the case of diclofenak treatment without vitamins Cmax corresponds to 1137.2 +/- 82.4 ng/ml, with 2 tablets of Gitagamp--Cmax 1326.7 +/- 122.5 ng/ml, and with 4 tablets--Cmax 2200.4 +/- 111.3 ng/ml. Positive influence of vitamin B group on the decrease of pain syndrome was shown. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics data were confirmed in electrochemical experiments with cytochrome P450 3A4. For enzyme immobilization screen printed graphite electrodes modified with gold nanoparticles and synthetic membrane-like compound didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB/Au) were used. Electrochemical analysis reviled the influence of vitamin B group on metabolism of non steroid anti inflammation drug diclofenac catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A4. Riboflavin was the most effective inhibitor of diclofenac hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 3A4 as was compared at 300 M concentration of vitamin B group (B1, B2, B6). These data confirmed the opportunity of pharmacokinetic parameters regulation and the level of pharmacodynamic effects by the influence of vitamin B group on the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4."
2008,18807759,Lowering of intraocular pressure by topical application of Daucus carota seed extract in rabbits.,"In normotensive rabbits topical application of Daucus carota seed extract at the concentration of 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2% resulted in mean IOP reduction of 19.33. 23.20 and 25.61% respectively from baseline. As no significant difference was observed between the change in IOP in 0.6 and 1.2% extract treated groups, 0.6% concentration was chosen for further evaluation in rabbits with experimentally elevated IOP. In water loaded rabbits, maximum mean IOP reduction with 0.6% extract was 29.39%, which was comparable to pilocarpine. In steroid pretreated rabbits, maximum mean IOP reduction was 30.27% from baseline, which was significantly higher than pilocarpine. The extract showed a comparatively slower onset of action however, the duration of action was comparable to pilocarpine in all the experimental models."
2016,26213012,Steviol glycosides targeted analysis in leaves of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) from plants cultivated under chilling stress conditions.,"Stevia rebaudiana is an important agricultural crop for the production of a high-potency natural sweetener, sensitive to low temperature during the developmental stage. Stimulation of chilling stress with a pre-treatment with endogenous signalling components and in particular with salicylic acid (SA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) could induce tolerance to chilling and could constitute a suitable way to maintain quality and quantity of steviol glycosides under controlled artificial environment. In the present work the effects of different putative signalling molecules on the morpho-physiological parameters were evaluated, and a specific method for the quali-quantitative analysis of steviol glycosides in S. rebaudiana plants cultivated under controlled conditions was developed, by using LC-ESI-FT (Orbitrap) MS, LC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS and multivariate data analysis. This approach underlined that the pre-treatment has influence on the production of secondary metabolites. In particular Stevia plants characterised by higher contents of rebaudioside A and stevioside, were identified. "

The ED90 concentrations which are the concentrations of hydroxyurea and cytarabine inducing a 90% maximum inhibition of colony formation and colony growth on day 7 in HL-60 cells were calculated from the logarithmic regression analysis of each dose response curve using the cricket graph version 1.3 program on an Apple Macintosh computer. Recombinant human GM-CSF significantly enhanced the cytostatic effect of hydroxyurea and cytarabine, and consequently reduced their ED90 concentrations. The present in vitro results provide a rationale for investigating the efficacy of combined recombinant human GM-CSF and hydroxyurea or cytarabine treatment in myeloid leukaemic patients."
2019,31026730,Protective effects of Rosavin on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via suppressing fibrotic and inflammatory signaling pathways in mice.,"Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is diagnosed as a life-threatening, progressive and incurable lung disease characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix and myofibroblasts, resulting in the function degradation and structural alterations in normal lung parenchyma. Notably, Pulmonary Fibrosis has been considering as a difficult problem in clinical with high mortality and effective treatment strategies. Rosavin, a benzylPropylene glycoside, is isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., exhibiting nootropic, anti-depressant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. In this study, we attended to elucidate the pharmacological activity of Rosavin for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in mice. The results indicated that Rosavin could significantly ameliorate the lung index and Pathological structure of mice with Pulmonary fibrosis by bleomycin-induced. Additionally, Rosavin could evidently decreased inflammatory cells infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in lung tissue specimens induced by bleomycin. Rosavin could down-regulate the expression of hydroxyproline and malondialdehyde and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase in lung tissue. The expression of Nrf2 were increased, and the expression of NF-κB p65, TGF-β1 and α-SMA were inhibited. The findings revealed the protective effects and the primary mechanism of rosavin on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which provided a scientific foundation for Rosavin as a promising candidate for Pulmonary fibrosis treatment."
2015,25053064,Antifungal activity and inhibition of fumonisin production by Rosmarinus officinalis L. essential oil in Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg.,"The chemical composition of Rosmarinus officinalis L. essential oil (REO) was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The main compounds of the REO were 1.8 cineole (52.2%), camphor (15.2%) and α-pinene (12.4%). The mycelial growth of Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg was reduced significantly by 150 μg/mL of REO. Significant microscopic morphological changes were visualised, such as the rupture of the cell wall and the leakage of cytoplasm at 300 μg/mL of REO. At lower concentrations of REO, the effects on the production of ergosterol and the biomass of mycelium varied, as did the effects on the production of fumonisins, but at ≥300 μg/mL of REO, these processes were significantly inhibited, showing the effectiveness of the REO as an antifungal agent. The results suggested that the REO acts against F. verticillioides by disrupting the cell wall and causing the loss of cellular components, subsequently inhibiting the production of fumonisins and ergosterol."
2006,16755016,Effects of plastoquinones from the brown alga Sargassum micracanthum and a new chromene derivative converted from the plastoquinones on acute gastric lesions in rats.,"Previously, we reported the anti oxidative and anti viral effects of plastoquinones (compounds 1, 2) extracted from the seaweed Sargassum micracanthum (Kuetzing) Endlicher and a new chromene compound (compound 3), which was converted from the plastoquinones. Recently, we have also demonstrated the antiulcer effects of these compounds and assessed the effects using a rat model of acute gastric lesion and fundus strips isolated from rats. In hydrochloric acid/ethanol rat ulcer tests: 1) oral administrations of compounds 1, 2, and 3 1--10, 3--30 and 10--30 mg/kg, respectively, and omeprazole 3--30 mg/kg showed dose-dependent antiulcer effects: 2) the antiulcer effects after intraduodenal administration of the respective compounds at the dose of 30 mg/kg were found to be significant: and 3) a decrease in the hexosamine level of the gastric mucosa was slightly improved by oral administration of compounds 1, 2, and 3 30 mg/kg. In indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer tests, the antiulcer effects of compounds 1, 2, and 3 10 mg/kg (p.o.) were not significant. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 showed slight contracting effects on the fundus isolated from rats and these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with AH6809, an inhibitor of prostaglandin DP, EP(1), and EP(2) receptors. These results suggest that the protection of the mucosa via endogenous prostaglandins might be related to the antiulcer effects of compounds 1, 2, and 3."
2013,23842700,"Protective effect of edible marine algae, Laminaria japonica and Porphyra haitanensis, on subchronic toxicity in rats induced by inorganic arsenic.","Arsenic, a potent environmental toxic agent, causes various hazardous effects on human health. This study was performed to evaluate the protective effects of edible marine algae, Laminaria japonica and Porphyra haitanensis, on subchronic stress of rats induced by arsenic trioxide (As2O3). The co-treatment of marine algae could slightly increase the growth rates of body weights compared to the As2O3-treated group. The marine algae application restored liver and renal function by preventing the increment in the activities of alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, and the levels of total protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. The increase in the contents of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decrease in the contents of high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in algae co-treated groups which indicated that marine algae could reverse the abnormal lipid metabolisms induced by arsenic. Moreover, these algae could protect the rats from lipid peroxidation by restoring the depletion of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and sulfhydryl group contents, and lowering the enhanced malondialdehyde contents. Therefore, evidences indicate that L. japonica and P. haitanensis can serve as an effective regimen for treating arsenic poisoning. "
2004,15175808,Enhancement of neovascularization with cord blood CD133+ cell-derived endothelial progenitor cell transplantation.,"The endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are responsible for postnatal vasculogenesis in physiological and pathological neovascularization and have been used for attenuating ischemic diseases. However, EPCs from umbilical cord blood (CB) were not well understood and the homing mechanisms of EPCs remain unclear. To determine the potential application of CB-derived EPCs, we established a culture system to induce the differentiation of CB cells into EPCs. Purified CB CD133(+) cells proliferated and, after further vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) antibody purification, differentiated into EPCs expressing endothelial markers, such as VE-cadherin, VEGFR-2, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and Weibel-Palade bodies. These cells could also take up acetylated lower density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) and bind Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1). When expanded EPCs were transplanted via tail vein into nude mice, they incorporated into capillary networks in ischemic hindlimb, augmented neovascularization, and improved ischemic limb salvage. In addition, in ischemic tissue, there were elevated expressions of VEGF and stromal derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha), both of which had chemotactic effect on EPCs. Moreover, P-/E-selectins was found on mouse ischemic endothelium and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on CB-derived EPCs. Neutralizing antibody against PSGL-1 blocked the homing of EPCs to ischemic area by 61%. These results demonstrate that CB CD133(+) cell-derived EPCs can be applied for therapeutic neovascularization in ischemic diseases, and reveal important roles of chemoattractants and adhesive molecules in the homing of EPCs."
2001,11724765,Anti-inflammatory effect of synthetic somatostatin analogues in the rat.,"1. Somatostatin (6.11 nmol kg(-1) i.p.) inhibited neurogenic plasma extravasation evoked by 1% mustard oil and non-neurogenic oedema induced by 5% dextran in the rat skin. 2. Cyclic synthetic octapeptide (TT-248 and TT-250) and heptapeptide (TT-232) somatostatin analogues proved to be more effective in reducing neurogenic and non-neurogenic inflammatory reactions but octreotide had no influence on either neurogenic or non-neurogenic inflammation. 3. TT-232 administered i.p. or i.v. (1.06 - 42.40 nmol kg(-1)) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the plasma extravasation evoked by mustard oil in the rat's paw. Neither diclofenac (15.78 - 315.60 micromol kg(-1)) nor the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam (2.95 - 569.38 micromol kg(-1)) attenuated the mustard oil-induced neurogenic plasma extravasation. 4. TT-232, diclofenac and meloxicam dose-dependently diminished non-neurogenic dextran-oedema of the paw the ED(35) values were 1.73 nmol kg(-1) for TT-232 and 34.37 micromol kg(-1) for diclofenac. 5. TT-232 inhibited in the dose range of 1.06 - 21.21 nmol kg(-1) the bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation in the skin of the chronically denervated paw. 6. Mustard oil-induced cutaneous plasma extravasation was dose-dependently diminished by s.c. TT-232 1, 2, 4, 6 or 16 h after the treatment. TT-232 (2 x 106, 2 x 212 and 2 x 530 nmol kg(-1) per day s.c. for 18 days) caused dose-dependent inhibition of chronic Freund adjuvant-induced arthritis during the experimental period. 7. TT-232 (200 and 500 nM) inhibited the release of SP, CGRP and somatostatin from the rat isolated trachea induced by electrical field stimulation (40 V, 0.1 ms, 10 Hz, 120 s) or by capsaicin (10(-7) M), but did not influence the basal, non-stimulated peptide release. 8. It is concluded that somatostatin analogues without endocrine functions as TT-232 are promising compounds with a novel site of action for inhibition of non-neurogenic and neurogenic inflammatory processes."
2018,29172713,Activation of the molecular and functional effects of Nrf2 against chronic iron oxide nanorod overload-induced cardiotoxicity.,"Reactive oxygen species have a significant role in the pathogenesis of iron oxide nanorod (IONR) overload-induced organ toxicity in some organs such as the lungs. Green tea induces upregulation of phase II antioxidant enzymes that are transcriptionally organized by the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) that when activated antagonize the oxidative stress induced by IONR overload that causes cardiotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether treatment of cardiotoxicity with iron chelators (deferiprone (DFP) or deferoxamine (DFO)) alone or in combination with phytochemical activation of Nrf2 (green tea) can protect cardiomyocytes from IONR overload-induced cardiotoxicity. One hundred five rats were distributed into seven groups: two control groups (non-IONR-overloaded and IONR-overloaded) and five IONR-overloaded groups such as a green tea group, DFP group, DFP combined with green tea group, DFO group, and DFO combined with green tea. Blood samples and cardiac tissues were obtained for estimation of total iron-binding capacity, ratio of myocardial 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine/myocardial 2-deoxyguanosine, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, glutathione (GSH) contents, and histopathological examination. The results showed mild histopathological changes in the heart and a significant decrease in all biochemical parameters, except for myocardial GSH, in the DFP group. The addition of green tea improved the biochemical and histopathological results compared with chelators alone."
2005,15785001,Anti-invasive activity of niacin and trigonelline against cancer cells.,"The effects of niacin, namely, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, and trigonelline on the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells were studied using a rat ascites hepatoma cell line of AH109A in culture. Niacin and trigonelline inhibited the invasion of hepatoma cells at concentrations of 2.5-40 microM without affecting proliferation. Hepatoma cells previously cultured with a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating system showed increased invasive activity. Niacin and trigonelline suppressed this ROS-potentiated invasive capacity through simultaneous treatment of AH109A cells with the ROS-generating system. The present study indicates for the first time the anti-invasive activities of niacin and trigonelline against cancer cells."
,28682277,Comparison of the effects of sodium bicarbonate jet prophylaxis on blood pressure in normotensive individuals and patients with controlled hypertension: a controlled clinical trial.,"This study assessed the blood pressure (BP) of normotensive subjects and subjects with pharmacologically controlled hypertension after sodium bicarbonate jet prophylaxis. Forty subjects were divided into 2 groups: a normotensive control group (n = 20) and a hypertensive group (n = 20). Blood pressure measurements were conducted at 4 timepoints: prior to the dental prophylaxis (T0), immediately after treatment (Ti), 15 minutes after treatment (T15), and 30 minutes after treatment (T30). The systolic BP (SBP) values for both groups were significantly increased at Ti (P < 0.05) and returned to their initial state at T15. Both groups also showed a significant increase in diastolic BP (DBP) values at Ti (P < 0.05); however, the basal conditions in hypertensive subjects were not restored until T30, whereas the values for normotensive subjects were restored at T15. The results indicated that systemic BP changed significantly after sodium bicarbonate jet prophylaxis in both study groups; while initial SBP values were restored by 15 minutes in both groups, the return to initial DBP values took longer in the hypertensive group than in the normotensive group."
1994,7847458,History of medicine and nephrology in Asia.,"The beginning of Chinese medicine has been attributed to 3 mythical emperors who gathered herbs for medicines. During the 2nd century BC, Han dynasty physicians developed cranial trephining and sedation with wine and herbs for anesthesia. Chiang Chung-Ching (142-212 AD) used the appearance of rashes in diagnosis, treated infections with anthelmintics and asthma with ephedra, described the symptoms of diabetes mellitus and expanded medical ethics. The specialties of obstetrics, pediatrics, ophthalmology and dentistry were described in the records of the Han and Tang dynasties, and methods of setting fractures and treating trauma were comparable with those of Roman military doctors. Shen Tua (1031-1095 AD) compiled a pharmacopeia and studied acupuncture and the pulses. Forensic medicine was developed during the 10th century by Sung Tse, who also advocated hand washing with sulfur and vinegar to avoid infection during autopsies. The Daoist physicians used androgens and estrogens to treat hypogonadism with therapeutic preparations of placentas. They also had an advanced knowledge of alchemy, claiming to achieve 'immortality' by their preservation techniques. Qualifying examinations for physicians were conducted by the Chinese state as early as the 1st century AD, and later incorporated philosophy and art to conform with the Confucian ideal. Throughout these eras, Chinese medicine profited from contact with western Asia. In ancient Chinese medicine, the excretory function of the kidney was attributed to the bladder. 'Kidney weakness', which refers to somatized depression, was treated by acupuncture along the 'kidney channel'. Pulse examination was also used to give a measure of the imbalance of renal Yin and Yang.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2014,23771520,Role of metabolism by intestinal microbiota in pharmacokinetics of oral baicalin.,"Baicalin (baicalein-7-glucuronide) is a flavonoid purified from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi that has traditionally been used for treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and viral hepatitis. In this study, the effects of intestinal microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of baicalin were investigated in normal and antibiotic-pretreated rats following p.o. administration of 100 mg/kg baicalin by using liquid chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. When rats were pretreated orally with cefadroxil, oxytetracycline and erythromycin for 3 days to control the number of intestinal bacteria, the pharmacokinetic parameters of oral baicalin were significantly affected by antibiotics: Cmax, T1/2(β), Kel and AUC values were significantly changed compared to those in normal rats. These results indicate that intestinal microbiota might play a key role in the oral pharmacokinetics of baicalin."
2007,17617944,"Improvement of nutritional status and incidence of infection in hospitalised, enterally fed elderly by feeding of fermented milk containing probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (NCC533).","Probiotics have potential to improve host immunity; however, there is less evidence showing their efficacy against infections and nutritional status in the elderly. We conducted a double-blinded feeding trial in the elderly to elucidate the effect of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (LC1) on infections and nutritional status. Twenty-four completely enterally fed elderly in-patients aged over 70 years were randomly assigned into two groups. All subjects were administered 3768 kJ (900 kcal)/d of total enteral nutrition (EN) through tube feeding for 12 weeks. Subjects in the LC1 group were administered 373 kJ (89 kcal)/d of LC1 fermented milk after feeding of 3395 kJ (811 kcal)/d of EN for 12 weeks. In the control group, 373 kJ/d of the same EN was replaced from the fermented milk. In the LC1 group, the percentage of days with infections during the run-in observation period was 15.4 (SD 17.3) %, which significantly decreased to 5.7 (SD 8.1) % during the intervention period (P = 0.018), and the reduction was larger than that of the control group (P = 0.047). Blood Hb increased (P < 0.05), and there was a tendency towards an increase in serum albumin and a decrease in TNF-alpha (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) in the LC1 group. There was a trend towards an increase in blood phagocytic activity (a natural immunity marker) in the subjects whose initial level was low in the LC1 group. There were no changes in those parameters in the control group. Administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic L. johnsonii La1 may contribute to suppressing infections by improving nutritional and immunological status in the elderly."
,16309187,Unfiltered xenon light is useful for photodynamic therapy with acridine orange.,"We have clarified that photodynamic therapy (PDT) with acridine orange (AO) exerts a rapid and strong cytocidal effect on mouse osteosarcomas, both in vitro and in vivo, and have sought to apply this therapy to patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas, in order to reduce the surgical margin and obtain better limb function after tumor resection in limb salvage surgery. Some clinical studies have reported that the local recurrence rate after limb salvage surgery in patients receiving PDT therapy was less than 10% and that the limb functions recovered to nearly normal in these patients. For these basic and clinical studies, we used a blue light beam filtered from a xenon lamp for the AO excitation, because of its maximal absorption. However, the relationship between the cytocidal effect of PDT and the wavelength or illuminance (lux) of the excitation light in AO-PDT is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the cytocidal effects of AO-PDT on mouse osteosarcoma cells using lights of various illuminances and wavelengths from a xenon lamp. Our results revealed that, while the blue and green filtered lights exerted cytocidal effects depending on their illuminance, orange light exerted no such effect. Blue light showed the strongest cytocidal effect under constant illuminance. However, unfiltered light with 10 times the illuminance of blue light yielded a much stronger cytocidal effect, which was deduced not to be due to DNA injury by ultra-violet light or heat generation by ultra-red light, since a xenon lamp emits little of either light. Based on these results, we conclude that, for effective AO-PDT in clinical practice, strong unfiltered light from a xenon lamp is more effective and feasible than weak filtered blue light."
2016,27058607,"Protective Capacity of Resveratrol, a Natural Polyphenolic Compound, against Deoxynivalenol-Induced Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Bacterial Translocation.","Contamination of food/feedstuffs by mycotoxins is a serious problem worldwide, causing severe economic losses and serious health problems in animals/humans. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a major mycotoxin contaminant and is known to impair intestinal barrier function. Grapes and red wine are rich in polyphenols, such as resveratrol (RES), which has striking antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. RES is a food-derived component; therefore, it may be simultaneously present with DON in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to explore in vitro protective effects of RES against DON-induced intestinal damage. The results showed that RES could protect DON-induced bacteria translocation because of enhanced of intestinal barrier function by restoring the DON-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and increase in paracellular permeability. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that RES protects against DON-induced barrier dysfunction by promoting the assembly of claudin-4 in the tight junction complex. This is probably mediated through modulation of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion via mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways. Our results imply that RES can protect against DON-induced intestinal damage and that RES may be used as a novel dietary intervention strategy to reduce DON toxicity in animals/humans."
2009,19519975,Inhibition of markers of bone resorption by consumption of vitamin D and calcium-fortified soft plain cheese by institutionalised elderly women.,"Acceleration of bone remodelling increases the risk of fragility fractures. The objective of the present study was to explore in elderly women whether a vitamin D and Ca-fortified dairy product providing about 17-25 % of the recommended intakes in vitamin D, Ca and proteins would reduce secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone remodelling in a way that may attenuate age-related bone loss in the long term. Thirty-seven institutionalised women, aged 84.8 (sd 8.1) years, with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (5.5 (sd 1.7) ng/ml) were enrolled into a multicentre open trial to consume during 1 month two servings of soft plain cheese made of semi-skimmed milk providing daily 686 kJ (164 kcal), 2.5 microg vitamin D, 302 mg Ca and 14.2 g proteins. The primary endpoint was the change in serum carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), selected as a marker of bone resorption. Thirty-five subjects remained compliant. Mean serum changes were: 25-hydroyvitamin D, +14.5 % (P = 0.0051); parathyroid hormone (PTH), - 12.3 % (P = 0.0011); CTX, - 7.5 % (P = 0.01); tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP 5b), - 9.9 % (P < 0.0001); albumin, +6.2 % (P < 0.0001); insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I),+16.9 % (P < 0.0001); osteocalcin, +8.3 % (P = 0.0166); amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP),+19.3 % (P = 0.0031). The present open trial suggests that fortified soft plain cheese consumed by elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency can reduce bone resorption markers by positively influencing Ca and protein economy, as expressed by decreased PTH and increased IGF-I, respectively. The rise in the bone formation marker P1NP could be explained by a protein-mediated increase in IGF-I. Thus, such a dietary intervention might uncouple, at least transiently, bone resorption from bone formation and thereby attenuate age-related bone loss."
2014,25034211,"Evaluation of the transporter-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of DA-9801, a standardized dioscorea extract for diabetic neuropathy, in human in vitro and rat in vivo.","Drug transporters play important roles in the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs and thereby, modulate drug efficacy and toxicity. With a growing use of poly pharmacy, concurrent administration of herbal extracts that modulate transporter activities with drugs can cause serious adverse reactions. Therefore, prediction and evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential is important in the clinic and in the drug development process. DA-9801, comprising a mixed extract of Dioscoreae rhizoma and Dioscorea nipponica Makino, is a new standardized extract currently being evaluated for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in a phase II clinical study.The inhibitory effects of DA-9801 on the transport functions of organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were investigated in HEK293 or LLC-PK1 cells. The effects of DA-9801 on the pharmacokinetics of relevant substrate drugs of these transporters were also examined in vivo in rats.DA-9801 inhibited the in vitro transport activities of OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, and OATP1B1, with IC50 values of 106, 174, 48.1, and 273 μg/mL, respectively, while the other transporters were not inhibited by 300 μg/mL DA-9801. To investigate whether this inhibitory effect of DA-9801 on OCT1, OCT2, and OAT3 could change the pharmacokinetics of their substrates in vivo, we measured the pharmacokinetics of cimetidine, a substrate for OCT1, OCT2, and OAT3, and of furosemide, a substrate for OAT1 and OAT3, by co-administration of DA-9801 at a single oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg. Pre-dose of DA-9801 5 min or 2 h prior to cimetidine administration decreased the Cmax of cimetidine in rats. However, DA-9801 did not affect the elimination parameters such as half-life, clearance, or amount excreted in the urine, suggesting that it did not inhibit elimination process of cimetidine, which is governed by OCT1, OCT2, and OAT3. Moreover, DA-9801 did not affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics of furosemide, as evidenced by its unchanged pharmacokinetic parameters.Inhibitory effects of DA-9801 on OCT1, OCT2, and OAT3 observed in vitro may not necessarily translate into in vivo herb-drug interactions in rats even at its maximum effective dose."
2015,25952850,Melatonin treatment of pre-veraison grape berries to increase size and synchronicity of berries and modify wine aroma components.,"A comprehensive investigation was carried out to determine the effect of exogenous melatonin treatment of pre-veraison grapes on grape berries and its wines. Two melatonin treatments of pre-veraison grape berries increased the weight of the berries by approximately 6.6%. Meanwhile, this melatonin treatment could be beneficial in the reduction of underripe and overripe fruits and in enhancing the synchronicity of the berries. In addition, there were significant differences in the volatile compound composition between the wine produced from the melatonin-treated berries and the wines made from untreated berries. The wine from melatonin-treated pre-veraison grape berries had stronger fruity, spicy, and sweet sensory properties, compared to the wines made from untreated berries. Prolonging the treatment through repeated applications can enhance these effects and under different seasonal conditions, more pronounced effects on the grape quality and wine properties can be observed.

2016,27138708,Moracin M inhibits airway inflammation by interrupting the JNK/c-Jun and NF-κB pathways in vitro and in vivo.,"The therapeutic effectiveness of moracins as 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives against airway inflammation was examined. Moracin M, O, and R were isolated from the root barks of Morus alba, and they inhibited interleukin (IL)-6 production from IL-1β-treated lung epithelial cells (A549) at 101-00μM. Among them, moracin M showed the strongest inhibitory effect (IC50=8.1μM). Downregulation of IL-6 expression by moracin M was mediated by interrupting the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway. Moracin derivatives inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-catalyzed NO production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated alveolar macrophages (MH-S) at 50-100μM. In particular, moracin M inhibited NO production by downregulating iNOS. When orally administered, moracin M (20-60mg/kg) showed comparable inhibitory action with dexamethasone (30mg/kg) against LPS-induced lung inflammation, acute lung injury, in mice with that of dexamethasone (30mg/kg). The action mechanism included interfering with the activation of nuclear transcription factor-κB in inflamed lungs. Therefore, it is concluded that moracin M inhibited airway inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and it has therapeutic potential for treating lung inflammatory disorders. "
1994,7919342,Identification of upstream signals regulating interleukin-6 gene expression during in vitro treatment of human B cells with pokeweed mitogen.,"The present studies have characterized the regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression during pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven human B-cell differentiation. PWM induced an early and transient increase in the expression of immediate-early response genes of the jun/fos leucine zipper family (c-jun, jun B, c-fos, and fos-B). The induction of c-jun mRNA by PWM was concentration dependent. Nuclear run-on assays showed that PWM treatment is associated with an increased rate of c-jun gene transcription. The induction of c-jun mRNA precedes the induction of IL-6 gene expression and IL-6 secretion by the B cells. c-Jun antisense, but not sense, oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) significantly decreases PWM-related B-cell (1) proliferation; (2) IL-6 mRNA induction; (3) IL-6 secretion; and (4) nuclear extract binding to AP-1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In contrast, c-Fos anti-sense ODN did not effect either IL-6 mRNA induction or IL-6 secretion triggered in B cells by PWM. The results further show activation of c-Raf-1 kinase in PWM-treated B cells. Raf-1 acts upstream to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase; therefore, studies were performed to assay for MAP kinase activation in these cells. The results show an increase in phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and c-Jun ""Y"" peptide in PWM-treated B cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that PWM is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signaling cascade in normal human splenic B cells, which, at least in part, involves serine/threonine protein kinases. These results show transient induction of immediate-early response genes in B cells and support a potential role for the c-jun gene product in regulation of IL-6 transcription and secretion."
2019,30970232,Baicalein improves glucose metabolism in insulin resistant HepG2 cells.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is the primary pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, often used in the clinical treatment of T2DM. Baicalein which is considered to have anti-IR effects is one of its active ingredients. IR-induced HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of baicalein on glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling pathway, using metformin as a positive control. We found that the use of both baicalein and metformin increased the glucose consumption of IR cells, as well as increasing the pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucokinase (GCK) activity. Also increased was the expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Reduced expression levels were found in that of glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA. The results confirmed that baicalein (10-6 and 10-5 mol/L) promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis, inhibits gluconeogenesis of hepatocytes to improve glucose metabolism, and may be as a result from regulation of InsR/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, baicalein has large concentration range on inhibiting IR, and at lower concentrations has strong anti-IR hepatocyte activity."

They lived in the animal quarters with a stable temperature and humidity being fed with standard fodder (Murigan) and water ad libitum."
2010,20731662,Momordica charantia leaf extract suppresses rat prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo.,"Cancer metastasis is a major cause of death in cancer patients, with invasion as a first step greatly contributing to the failure of clinical treatments. Any compounds with an inhibitory influence on this process are therefore of prime interest. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is widely consumed as a vegetable and especially as a folk medicine in Asia. Here, we investigated the anti-invasive effects of bitter melon leaf extract (BMLE) on a rat prostate cancer cell line (PLS10) in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that non-toxic concentrations of BMLE significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of cells in vitro. The results of zymography showed that BMLE inhibited the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) from PLS10. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that BMLE not only significantly decreased gene expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, but also markedly increased the mRNA level of TIMP-2, known to have inhibitory effects on the activity of MMP-2. An EnzChek gelatinase/collagenase assay showed that collagenase type IV activity was partially inhibited by BMLE. In the in vivo study, intravenous inoculation of PLS10 to nude mice resulted in a 100% survival rate in the mice given a BMLE-diet as compared with 80% in the controls. The incidence of lung metastasis did not show any difference, but the percentage lung area occupied by metastatic lesions was slightly decreased in the 0.1% BMLE treatment group and significantly decreased with 1% BMLE treatment as compared with the control. Thus, the results indicate for the first time an anti-metastatic effect of BMLE both in vitro and in vivo."
2016,27780138,Malva sylvestris extract protects upon lithium carbonate-induced kidney damages in male rat.,"Malva sylvestris has recently attracted special attention due to its potential activities in many chronic disorders. We aimed to assess the beneficial effects of Malva sylvestris extract against lithium carbonate induced renal damage in male Wistar rats. For this purpose, Malva sylvestris extract at a dose of 0.2g/kg was orally administrated, followed by 25mg/kg of lithium carbonate (intraperitoneal injection) for 30 days. Malva sylvestris extract was proved to contain large amounts of K+, Na+, Ca++ and the existence of phenolic acids and flavonoids shown by the obtained HPLC-based analysis. The antioxidant capacities in vitro showed high level of radical scavenging activity and reducing power. The in vivo results showed that intraperitoneal injection of lithium carbonate exhibited a significant increase (p<0.01) of serum creatinine and urea and reduced serum sodium and potassium concentrations. Lithium carbonate also induced oxidative damage as indicated by a significant raise in LPO level associated with a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in the kidney. However, pretreatment with Malva sylvestris extract restored the status of all parameters studied. It can be concluded that lithium carbonate has induced oxidative stress, biochemical changes and histopathological damage but the supplementation with Malva sylvestris extract has prevented such toxicity."

Using silicon and zinc glycerolates as biocompatible precursors we synthesized by the sol-gel method a new bioactive silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel combining the positive pharmacological properties of the precursors. In the present work the structural features of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel and its immunotropic properties were studied. The advanced physical methods, including XRD, TEM, dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering, were used for studying the structural features of the gel. Hydrolysis of zinc monoglycerolate was investigated under gelation conditions. Evaluation of the efficiency of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel in providing immune functions was carried out using a model of the complicated wound process behind immunosuppression induced by hydrocortisone administration in the Wistar rats. It has been shown that zinc monoglycerolate exists in the state of amorphous nanoparticles in the cells of 3D-network formed due to incomplete hydrolysis of silicon glycerolates and subsequent silanol condensation. Zinc monoglycerolate is not hydrolyzed and does not enter 3D-network of the gel with the formation of Zn-O-Si groups, but it forms a separate phase. Immunotropic action of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel was revealed by the histology and immunohistochemistry methods. Amorphous nanoparticles of zinc monoglycerolate, water-soluble silicon glycerolates, and products of their hydrolytic transformations, which are present in a aqueous-glycerol medium, are in the first place responsible for the pharmacological activity of hydrogel. The results obtained allow us to consider silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel as a promising immunotropic agent for topical application."
2014,24731926,Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of osteocalcin affects the efficacy of teriparatide (PTH(1-34)) for skeletal repair.,"Teriparatide (PTH1-34) promotes skeletal repair and increases bone mass. Vitamin K is involved in bone mineralization as a coenzyme of γ-carboxylase for Gla proteins, and therefore vitamin K insufficiency caused by malnutrition or therapeutic intake of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin could affect the efficacy of PTH1-34 therapy for bone repair. In the present study, we investigated whether vitamin K influences the efficacy of PTH1-34 therapy for bone repair in a rat osteotomy model. Female 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a closed midshaft osteotomy of the femur and randomized into four groups (n=10 per group): vehicle, PTH1-34 (daily 30 μg/kg/day subcutaneous injection)+solvent (orally, three times a week), PTH1-34+warfarin (0.4 mg/kg/day orally, three times a week), and PTH1-34+vitamin K2 (menatetrenone, 30 mg/kg/day orally, three times a week). Serum γ-carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC and Glu-OC) levels and radiographic healing were monitored every 2 weeks. Skeletal repair was assessed by micro-computed tomography, mechanical testing, and histology at 8weeks after surgery. PTH1-34 amplified the osteotomy-induced increase in Gla-OC and improved the mechanical properties as well as the volumetric bone mineral tissue density of the fracture callus. Concurrent use of warfarin decreased the response to PTH1-34 therapy in terms of mechanical recovery, probably by impairing mineralization due to the lack of Gla-OC. Although the effects of combination therapy with PTH1-34 and vitamin K2 on bone repair did not significantly exceed those of PTH1-34 monotherapy in rats fed sufficient dietary vitamin K, postoperative Gla-OC levels were correlated with the mechanical properties of the osteotomized femur in PTH1-34-treated rats regardless of the use of warfarin or vitamin K2. These findings suggest the importance of vitamin K dependent γ-carboxylation of OC for realizing the full effects of PTH1-34 on skeletal repair."
2002,11885397,Update on natural product--drug interactions.,"The interactions of natural products with drugs are discussed. Interactions between natural products and drugs are based on the same pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles as drug-drug interactions. Clinically important interactions appear to involve effects on drug metabolism via cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, impairment of hepatic or renal function, and other possible mechanisms. Natural products that have been reported to interact with drugs in humans include coenzyme Q10, dong quai, ephedra, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, glucosamine sulfate, ipriflavone, melatonin, and St. John's wort. In many cases, more research is needed to confirm these interactions and to determine whether other natural products may also interact with drugs. To effectively counsel patients about interactions involving natural products, pharmacists should be familiar with the most commonly used products and have access to information on more obscure products. In view of the less than stringent provisions of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, pharmacists should consult reliable, independent sources of information on natural products rather than rely on literature provided by manufacturers. Pharmacists should recommend only those products that are manufactured to high quality-control standards. Natural products can interact with drugs and with other natural products by the same mechanisms as drugs."
2017,27856160,Anti-excitotoxic effects of cannabidiol are partly mediated by enhancement of NCX2 and NCX3 expression in animal model of cerebral ischemia.,"Excitotoxicity and imbalance of sodium and calcium homeostasis trigger pathophysiologic processes in cerebral ischemia which can accelerate neuronal death. Neuroprotective role of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main non-psychoactive phytocannabinoids of the cannabis plant, has attracted attention of many researchers in the neurodegenerative diseases studies. The present investigation was designed to determine whether cannabidiol can alleviate the severity of ischemic damages and if it is able to exert its anti-excitotoxic effects through sodium and calcium regulation. By using stereotaxic surgery, a guide cannula was implanted into the lateral ventricle. Cannabidiol (50, 100, and 200ng/rat; i.c.v.) was administrated for 5 consecutive days. After pretreatment, the rats were subjected to 60min of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After 24h, neurological deficits score, infarct volume, brain edema, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in total of hemisphere, cortex, piriform cortex-amygdala, and striatum were assessed. The expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) protein as an endogenous target in these regions was also studied. The present results indicate that administration of cannabidiol (100 and 200ng/rat) in the MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia caused a remarkable reduction in neurological deficit, infarction, brain edema, and BBB permeability in comparison with the vehicle group. Up-regulation of NCX2 and NCX3 in cannabidiol-received groups was also observed. These findings support the view that the reduction of ischemic injuries elicited by cannabidiol can be at least partly due to the enhancement of NCX protein expression and its cerebro-protective role in those cerebral territories supplied by MCA."
2007,17468076,Cytokines related to nutritional status in patients with untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in Indonesia.,"Although several studies have dealt with the patterns of cytokine production in tuberculosis, little is known about the association between nutrient deficiencies and cytokines in tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to assess the concentration of cytokines related to nutritional status during tuberculosis. In 41 untreated tuberculosis patients and matched healthy controls in an urban hospital in Indonesia, we measured: height and weight, parameters of iron, vitamin A and zinc; and cytokines concentrations in the circulation and production in whole blood cultures. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Patients with cavities (n=26) had higher concentrations of IL-6 than patients without cavities (n=15). Body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 was associated with high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6. Anaemia was associated with high concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1ra. Zinc deficiency was associated with high LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha and IL-1ra. Marginal plasma retinol concentrations were associated with high concentrations of IL-6 after LPS stimulation. In conclusion, low concentrations of micronutrients in tuberculosis were associated with increased cytokine production. An intervention study would allow causality to be examined."
1996,8808027,Stability and compatibility of granisetron hydrochloride in i.v. solutions and oral liquids and during simulated Y-site injection with selected drugs.,"The stability and compatibility of granisetron hydrochloride in common i.v. fluids and oral liquids and during simulated Y-site injection with selected drugs were studied. One milliliter of solution containing granisetron 1 mg (as the hydrochloride salt) was added to 50 mL of 5% dextrose injection, 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 0.9% sodium chloride injection in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and to 5 mL of 5% dextrose injection, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or bacteriostatic water for injection in polypropylene syringes and stored at room temperature (20 degrees C) for 24 hours. One milliliter of the granisetron hydrochloride injection was added to 50 mL of apple juice, orange juice, cola, or an electrolyte replacement solution and stored for 60 minutes at room temperature. Twenty-nine drugs were mixed with the granisetron hydrochloride injection in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in volumes simulating Y-site injection and stored at room temperature. Finally, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection 0.5 mL and 1 mL of the granisetron hydrochloride injection were added to 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection in a PVC bag and stored for 60 minutes. Drug concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and color, clarity, and pH were evaluated. Granisetron hydrochloride was stable in and compatible with all the i.v. solutions and oral liquids. Neither granisetron nor any of the drugs it was tested with during simulated Y-site injection showed any physical changes except for a slight Tyndall effect in the granisetron hydrochloride-doxorubicin hydrochloride combination; all the drugs retained at least 96% of initial concentrations. Granisetron and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were stable and compatible in the admixture. Granisetron 1 mg (as the hydrochloride salt) was stable for 24 hours in four i.v. infusion fluids in PVC bags and in 5% dextrose injection, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and bacteriostatic water for injection in polypropylene syringes; for 1 hour in four oral liquids; for 4 hours in the presence of each of 29 drugs during simulated Y-site injection; and for 1 hour when mixed with dexamethasone sodium phosphate in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in a PVC bag."
2005,16271263,"Inhibitory effect of DA-125, a new anthracyclin analog antitumor agent, on the invasion of human fibrosarcoma cells by down-regulating the matrix metalloproteinases.","Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes, play a pivotal role in tumor metastasis by cleavage of extracellular matrix as well as non-matrix substrates. In this study, we examined the influence of DA-125, a new anthracyclin analog, on the gene expression of MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) and in vitro invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cells. Dose-dependent decreases of MMPs and TIMPs mRNA levels were observed in DA-125-treated HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Gelatin zymography analysis also showed a significant down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HT1080 cells treated with DA-125 compared to controls. In addition, DA-125 inhibited the invasion, motility and cell migration, and colony formation of tumor cells. These data, therefore, provide direct evidence for the role of DA-125 as a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent, which can markedly inhibit the invasive capacity of malignant cells. Further, to clarify the transcriptional regulatory pathway, we primarily investigated the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the expression of MMPs by DA-125 in HT1080 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that DA-125 modulates the binding activity of NF-kappaB. Using the luciferase reporter gene assay, a dose-dependent down-regulation of NF-kappaB-mediated luciferase expression was also observed. These results suggest that DA-125 down-regulates MMPs expression in HT1080 cells through the NF-kappaB-mediated pathway."
2015,26378562,"Fire Blight Control: The Struggle Goes On. A Comparison of Different Fire Blight Control Methods in Switzerland with Respect to Biosafety, Efficacy and Durability.","Fire blight (FB), caused by Erwinia amylovora, is one of the most important pome fruit pathogens worldwide. To control this devastating disease, various chemical and biological treatments are commonly applied in Switzerland, but they fail to keep the infection at an acceptable level in years of heavy disease pressure. The Swiss authorities therefore currently allow the controlled use of the antibiotic streptomycin against FB in years that are predicted to have heavy infection periods, but only one treatment per season is permitted. Another strategy for controlling Erwinia is to breed resistant/tolerant apple cultivars. One way of accelerating the breeding process is to obtain resistant cultivars by inserting one or several major resistance genes, using genetic engineering. To date, no study summarizing the impact of different FB control measures on the environment and on human health has been performed. This study consequently aims to compare different disease-control measures (biological control, chemical control, control by antibiotics and by resistant/tolerant apple cultivars obtained through conventional or molecular breeding) applied against E. amylovora, considering different protection goals (protection of human health, environment, agricultural diversity and economic interest), with special emphasis on biosafety aspects. Information on each FB control measure in relation to the specified protection goal was assessed by literature searches and by interviews with experts. Based on our results it can be concluded that the FB control measures currently applied in Switzerland are safe for consumers, workers and the environment. However, there are several gaps in our knowledge of the human health and environmental impacts analyzed: data are missing (1) on long term studies on the efficacy of most of the analyzed FB control measures; (2) on the safety of operators handling streptomycin; (3) on residue analyses of Equisetum plant extract, the copper and aluminum compounds used in apple production; and (4) on the effect of biological and chemical control measures on non-target fauna and flora. These gaps urgently need to be addressed in the near future. "
2019,31207222,Neferine inhibits MDA-MB-231 cells growth and metastasis by regulating miR-374a/FGFR-2.,"Neferine (NEF) is a major bisbenzylisoquinline alkaloid mainly exists in the seed embryo of Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) that possesses anti-tumor effects. Our study designed to check the effect of NEF on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and further explore the potential mechanism.MDA-MB-231 cells were administrated with various dosages of NEF for 24 h after which cell viability was measured. The effects of NEF on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed by BrdU staining, flow cytometry assay and Transwell assay. Western blot was utilized to assess the accumulation of proteins related with proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways.Viability was efficiently reduced by NEF in a dose-dependent manner. NEF (8 μM) significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion but enhanced apoptosis in MDA-MB-213 cells. Interestingly, NEF suppressed miR-374a expression and miR-374a mediated the inhibitory effect of NEF. Moreover, miR-374a positively regulated FGFR-2 expression and FGFR-2 overexpression impeded the effect of NEF on MDA-MB-213 cells. FGFR-2 overexpression abolished the suppressive effect of NEF on PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways.We found that NEF possessed the anti-growth and anti-metastasis effect on MDA-MB-231 cells through regulating miR-374a/FGFR-2, which might provide new insight for breast cancer management."
2009,19325221,"[Examination of original plant of Jamaica quassia extract, a natural bittering agent, based on composition of the constituents].","Jamaica quassia extract is a natural bittering agent used as a food additive in Japan. The main constituents of the extract have already been reported to be quassin and neoquassin. In this study, the differences in composition of the constituents among four Jamaican quassia extract products were analyzed by LC/MS. The results showed that the four products have similar compositions of their minor constituents, as well as their main constituents. We isolated four of the minor constituents that were commonly included in the four products, and identified them as 11-dihydro-12-norneoquassin, canthin-6-one, 4-methoxy-1-vinyl-beta-carboline and 4,9-dimethoxy-1-vinyl-beta-carboline. The List of Existing Food Additives in Japan mentions that Jamaica quassia (Picrasma excelsa) is the original plant from which Jamaica quassia extract is produced. However, we presume that Jamaica quassia extract may actually be made from appropriate plants other than Picrasma excelsa, since P. excelsa is listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. We prepared hot water extracts from two other species of plants, Quassia amara (American quassia, Surinam quassia) and P. quassioides ('Nigaki' in Japanese), and investigated their constituents by LC/MS. The results showed that the compositions of the constituents in the Jamaica quassia extract products resembled those in the extract derived from Q. amara. These findings suggest that Jamaica quassia extract products are probably made from Q. amara."
2013,23870175,Portuguese propolis disturbs glycolytic metabolism of human colorectal cancer in vitro.,"Propolis is a resin collected by bees from plant buds and exudates, which is further processed through the activity of bee enzymes. Propolis has been shown to possess many biological and pharmacological properties, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunostimulant and antitumor activities. Due to this bioactivity profile, this resin can become an alternative, economic and safe source of natural bioactive compounds.Antitumor action has been reported in vitro and in vivo for propolis extracts or its isolated compounds; however, Portuguese propolis has been little explored. The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro antitumor activity of Portuguese propolis on the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-15, assessing the effect of different fractions (hexane, chloroform and ethanol residual) of a propolis ethanol extract on cell viability, proliferation, metabolism and death.Propolis from Angra do Heroísmo (Azores) was extracted with ethanol and sequentially fractionated in solvents with increasing polarity, n-hexane and chloroform. To assess cell viability, cell proliferation and cell death, Sulforhodamine B, BrDU incorporation assay and Anexin V/Propidium iodide were used, respectively. Glycolytic metabolism was estimated using specific kits.All propolis samples exhibited a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells, in a dose- and time-dependent way. Chloroform fraction, the most enriched in phenolic compounds, appears to be the most active, both in terms of inhibition of viability and cell death. Data also show that this cytotoxicity involves disturbance in tumor cell glycolytic metabolism, seen by a decrease in glucose consumption and lactate production.Our results show that Portuguese propolis from Angra do Heroísmo (Azores) can be a potential therapeutic agent against human colorectal cancer."
2016,26212985,Effect of Se treatment on glucosinolate metabolism and health-promoting compounds in the broccoli sprouts of three cultivars.,"Broccoli sprouts are natural functional foods for cancer prevention because of their high glucosinolate (GSL) content and high selenium (Se) accumulation capacity. The regulation mechanism of Se on GSL metabolism in broccoli sprouts was explored. In particular, the effects of Se treatment (100 μmol/L selenite and selenate) on the Se, sulfur (S), glucosinolate and sulforaphane contents; myrosinase activity and health-promoting compounds (ascorbic acid, anthocyanin, total phenolics and flavonoids) of three, 5 day old, cultivars were investigated. The treatment did not influence the total GSL and ascorbic acid contents; significantly increased the myrosinase activity and sulforaphane, anthocyanin and flavonoids contents; and decreased the total phenolics content. The increase in sulforaphane during early growth can be primarily attributed to the increased myrosinase activity caused by Se treatment. Broccoli sprouts with suitable selenite and selenate concentrations, in the early growth days, could be desirable for improved human health."
2019,30741117,Weight loss effect of sweet orange essential oil microcapsules on obese SD rats induced by high-fat diet.,"Obesity is one of the most common and major health concerns worldwide. Weight management through dietary supplements with natural plant extracts has become the focus of current research. Sweet orange essential oil (SOEO) is a natural plant extract, with many bioactivities. In order to evaluate the weight loss effect of SOEO microcapsules and investigate the underlying mechanism, we fed high-fat diet-induced obese SD rats with SOEO microcapsules for 15 days and found that SOEO microcapsules reduced body weight gain by 41.4%, decreased total cholesterol level, alleviated liver and adipose tissue pathological alteration. The results of fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that decreasing the expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ, upregulating of uncoupling protein 2, hormone sensitive lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, inhibiting the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase appear to be the mechanism of SOEO microcapsules to lose weight. This study suggests that SOEO microcapsule is a potential dietary supplement for weight loss. Abbreviations: SOEO: sweet orange essential oil; TC: total cholesterol; TG: triglyceride; LDL-c: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HDL-c: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PPARα: peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-α; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ; UCP2: uncoupling protein 2; HSL: hormone sensitive lipase; CPT1: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; NPY: neuropeptide Y; LEP: leptin; INS: insulin; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase."
2012,22802257,Role of heme oxygenase-1 in polymyxin B-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.,"Polymyxin B (PMB) is a cationic polypeptide antibiotic with activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. PMB-induced nephrotoxicity consists of direct toxicity to the renal tubules and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with oxidative damage. This study evaluated the nephroprotective effect of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) against PMB-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Adult male Wistar rats, weighing 286 ± 12 g, were treated intraperitoneally once a day for 5 days with saline, hemin (HO-1 inducer; 10 mg/kg), zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) (HO-1 inhibitor; 50 μmol/kg, administered before PMB on day 5), PMB (4 mg/kg), PMB plus hemin, and PMB plus ZnPP. Renal function (creatinine clearance, Jaffe method), urinary peroxides (ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange version 2 [FOX-2]), urinary thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), renal tissue thiols, catalase activity, and renal tissue histology were analyzed. The results showed that PMB reduced creatinine clearance (P < 0.05), with an increase in urinary peroxides and TBARS. The PMB toxicity caused a reduction in catalase activity and thiols (P < 0.05). Hemin attenuated PMB nephrotoxicity by increasing the catalase antioxidant activity (P < 0.05). The combination of PMB and ZnPP incremented the fractional interstitial area of renal tissue (P < 0.05), and acute tubular necrosis in the cortex area was also observed. This is the first study demonstrating the protective effect of HO-1 against PMB-induced nephrotoxicity."
2018,30125984,Route of exposure has a major impact on uptake of silver nanoparticles in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).,"The potential impact of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on aquatic organisms is to a large extent determined by their bioavailability through different routes of exposure. In the present study juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to different sources of radiolabeled Ag (radiolabeled 110m Ag NPs and 110m AgNO3 ). After 48 h of waterborne exposure to 3 μg/L citrate stabilized 110m Ag NPs or 110m AgNO3 , or a dietary exposure to 0.6 mg Ag/kg fish (given as citrate stabilized or uncoated 110m Ag NPs, or 110m AgNO3 ), Ag had been taken up in fish regardless of route of exposure or source of Ag (Ag NPs or AgNO3 ). Waterborne exposure led to high Ag concentrations on the gills, and dietary exposure led to high concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract. Silver distribution to the target organs was similar for both dietary and waterborne exposure, with the liver as the main target organ. The accumulation level of Ag was 2 to 3 times higher for AgNO3 than for Ag NPs when exposure was through water, whereas no significant differences were seen after dietary exposure. The transfer (Bq/g liver/g food or water) from exposure through water was 4 orders of magnitude higher than from feed using the smallest, citrate-stabilized Ag NPs (4 nm). The smallest NPs had a 5 times higher bioavailability in food compared with the larger and uncoated Ag NPs (20 nm). Despite the relatively low transfer of Ag from diet to fish, the short lifetime of Ag NPs in water and their transfer to sediment, feed, or sediment-dwelling food sources such as larvae and worms could make diet a significant long-term exposure route.

Synthesis of a novel metabolite.,"The metabolic transformations of labeled pyridoxine by hepatoma cells were studied. Buffalo rats were fed ad libitum a commercially prepared pyridoxine sufficient diet for 20 days at which time they were inoculated intramuscularly with hepatoma 7777 cells in both hind leg muscles. After tumor development, 50 microCi [6-3H] pyridoxine. HCl or 5 microCi [4,5-14C] pyridoxine. HCl was injected intraperitoneally per rat. Groups of animals were subsequently sacrificed at defined time intervals up to 9 days. Vitamin B6 labeled tumor metabolites were acid extracted and separated on a muBondapak C18 column by ion pairing reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. A novel vitamin metabolite contributing up to 28.5% of extractable radioactivity was found with retention time different than any of the known vitamin B6 compounds. Its pattern of synthesis in vivo from labeled pyridoxine was PN leads to PNP leads to PLP leads to PMP leads to X. Preliminary GC-mass spectral data suggested the unknown consisted of more than one species. This communication reports on the metabolism of vitamin B6 and the isolation, synthesis in vivo and possible significance of the novel metabolite to the economy of the tumor cells."
2000,10871740,Effective high-dose chemotherapy combined with CD34+-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in a patient with cutaneous CD30-negative large T cell lymphoma.,"Generalized multiple cutaneous tumors developed in a 60-year-old Japanese man. Skin biopsy revealed atypical large T lymphocytes infiltrating the dermis. CD30 staining was negative in the tumor cells. The diagnosis of CD30-negative cutaneous large T cell lymphoma was made. Axial and inguinal lymphadenopathy was present, but there was no evidence of bone marrow involvement. Seven cycles of chemotherapy and local electron beam irradiation were administered and complete remission (CR) was attained. As CD30-negative cutaneous large T cell lymphoma has a poor prognosis despite intensive chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy followed by CD34+-selected autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (CD34+-APBSCT) was prescribed. The clinical course after CD34+-selected APBSCT was complicated with CMV infection occurring twice but administration of ganciclovir resolved the symptoms. He has remained in CR for 16 months after CD34+-APBSCT. This appears to be the first case report of CD34+-APBSCT in a patient with CD30-negative cutaneous large T cell lymphoma.

1992,1382698,Interaction of human bone marrow fibroblasts with megakaryocytes: role of the c-kit ligand.,"Human kit ligand (KL), also known as stem cell factor (SCF), steel factor, or mast cell growth factor, is a recently identified hematopoietic growth factor whose receptor is the product of the c-kit proto-oncogene. Alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA of KL/SCF results in secreted and membrane-bound forms of the protein. We and others have recently shown that the c-kit gene product is expressed on human megakaryocytes and that soluble KL/SCF in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), or IL-6 increased megakaryocyte progenitor colony formation (CFU-MEG) and stimulated mature megakaryocytes. Here we show that adhesion of human megakaryocytes to bone marrow stromal fibroblasts, which express the membrane-bound form of KL/SCF (mKL/SCF), is mediated in part by the interaction between mKL/SCF and the c-kit protein. This interaction also results in marrow fibroblast-stimulated proliferation but not an increase in ploidy of megakaryocytes; when the two cell types were separated by a transoluble membrane, proliferation did not occur. Adhesion and proliferation of human megakaryocytes to an immortalized murine stromal cell line SI/SI lacking the KL/SCF gene was impaired, whereas transfection of SI/SI cells with human mKL/SCF significantly increased both adhesion and proliferation. Marrow stromal fibroblast mKL/SCF may serve both as an adhesion structure and as a growth-potentiating factor for megakaryocytes in the bone marrow."
2013,23923610,Anti-oxidative protection against iron overload-induced liver damage in mice by Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. leaf extract.,"In view of the contribution of iron deposition in the oxidative pathologic process of liver disease, the potential of 70% methanolic extract of C. cajan leaf (CLME) towards antioxidative protection against iron-overload-induced liver damage in mice has been investigated. DPPH radical scavenging and protection of Fenton reaction induced DNA damage was conducted in vitro. Post oral administration of CLME to iron overloaded mice, the levels of antioxidant and serum enzymes, hepatic iron, serum ferritin, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl and hydroxyproline contents were measured, in comparison to deferasirox treated mice. Oral treatment of the plant extract effectively lowered the elevated levels of liver iron, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl and hydroxyproline. There was notable increment in the dropped levels of hepatic antioxidants. The dosage of the plant extract not only made the levels of serum enzymes approach normal value, but also counteracted the overwhelmed serum ferritin level. The in vitro studies indicated potential antioxidant activity of CLME. The histopathological observations also substantiated the ameliorative function of the plant extract. Accordingly, it is suggested that Cajanus cajan leaf can be a useful herbal remedy to suppress oxidative damage caused by iron overload."

2015,25945908,[Prinzmetal angina after licorice consumption].,"Medical history | We report on a 44-year-old patient with recurrent thoracic pain occurring 4 months apart. The patient complained about intense thoracic pain and acute dyspnoea in the morning. In the course of the second presentation the anamnesis revealed that the previous day the patient had consumed an entire bag of licorice (200 g). Investigations | The blood pressure was 90/65 mmHg, heart rate 68 beats / min. Neither the performed ECG nor the transthoracic echocardiography showed abnormalities. The blood tests revealed elevated troponin levels only. No coronary artery stenosis was evident on left heart catheterization. After 4 months- the symptoms reappeared- the blood pressure was 110/50 mmHg. An ECG showed infarct-typical ST elevations. The performed coronary angiography showed no stenosis or embolism. Intracoronary nitro administration resulted in significant vasodilatation. After 6 hours in the control- ECG the ST elevations were missing. We diagnosed a Prinzmetal angina. Treatment and course | The patient was given advice not to consume licorice in the future. Her medication was adjusted to 2.5 mg amlodipine per day. There has been no further presentation with similar symptoms since then. Conclusion | Case reports provide evidence of unknown potential side- effects concerning well-known medical plants or substances. It is already known that the ingredients of licorice may induce hypertension. Potential spastic reactions, such as a Prinzmetal angina, due to the possible cardiac effects caused by glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid are rare side effects of licorice ingestion. "
1987,2820224,"In vitro immunoglobulin production, proliferation, and cell markers before and after antithymocyte globulin therapy in patients with aplastic anemia.","Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 16 aplastic anemia patients were studied for in vitro biosynthesis of immunoglobulins (Ig), proliferative responses, and cell markers before and after antithymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment in an attempt to identify immune functions that would be useful in predicting responses to ATG therapy. Six of the 16 aplastic anemia patients were complete responders to ATG therapy, two were partial responders, and eight failed to respond to ATG therapy. The proportion of E+, CD4, CD8, and surface Ig-positive cells did not correlate with in vitro lymphocyte functions nor clinical responses before or after ATG therapy. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, tetanus toxoid, alloantigens, or pokeweed mitogen were generally present before and after ATG therapy. When pokeweed mitogen, herpes simplex type I virus, and tetanus toxoid were used as probes to elicit in vitro Ig production using a hemolytic plaque assay, some patients had 1) B cells that failed to produce Ig, 2) T cells that failed to provide helper activity, and 3) T cells that exhibited excessive suppressor activity in the various antibody production systems. These measures of immune function, however, did not correlate with clinical responses to ATG therapy."

2006,16474422,"The effects of resveratrol, a phytoalexin derived from red wines, on chronic inflammation induced in an experimentally induced colitis model.","Neutrophil infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines, eicosanoid generation and oxidative stress have been implicated in colitis. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, with multiple pharmacological actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. In a previous report, we documented that resveratrol decreases the degree of inflammation associated with acute experimental colonic inflammation, but its effects on chronic experimental colitis remain undetermined. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the chronic colonic injury caused by intracolonic instillation of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) in rats. The inflammatory response was assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase activity. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production, histological and histochemical analysis of the lesions were also carried out. We determined the production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and D2 in colon mucosa, as well as cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 and nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 protein expression. Finally, since resveratrol has been found to modulate apoptosis, we intended to elucidate its effects on colonic mucosa under chronic inflammatory conditions. Resveratrol (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) significantly attenuated the damage score and corrected the disturbances in morphology associated to injury. In addition, the degree of neutrophil infiltration and the levels of TNF-alpha were significantly ameliorated. Resveratrol did not modify PGD2 levels but returned the decreased PGE2 values to basal levels and also reduced COX-2 and the NF-kappaB p65 protein expression. Furthermore, treatment of rats with resveratrol caused a significant increase of TNBS-induced apoptosis in colonic cells. In conclusion, resveratrol reduces the damage in chronic experimentally induced colitis, alleviates the oxidative events, returns PGE2 production to basal levels and stimulates apoptosis in colonic cells."
2017,27763892,Neuroinflammatory response to experimental stroke is inhibited by boldine.,"Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development of ischemic brain damage. Astrocyte activation promotes the production of several proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and iNOS. Eventually, neuronal death occurs, leading to the development of motor and memory deficits in patients. Boldine is the main alkaloid in the leaves and bark of the Peumus boldus Molina, and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The aim of this work was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of boldine on neuroinflammation and memory deficits induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in mice. Thirty minutes before pMCAO and during the next 5 days, animals received vehicle (0.025 µmol/l HCl) or boldine (8, 16 and 25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). The extension of the infarct area, neurological scores, and myeloperoxidase activity were evaluated 24 h after pMCAO. Locomotor activity, working, and aversive memory were evaluated 72 h after pMCAO, object recognition memory was tested 96 h after pMCAO, and spatial memory was tested 120 h after pMCAO. Cresyl violet, Fluoro-Jade C staining, and immunohistochemical for GFAP, TNF-α, and iNOS were also carried out. The treatment with boldine significantly decreased the infarct area, improved the neurological scores, and increased cell viability. The vertical exploratory activity and aversive, spatial, object recognition, and working memory deficits induced by pMCAO were prevented by boldine. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity and GFAP, TNF-α, and iNOS immunoreactivity were decreased significantly by boldine. Although various mechanisms such as its antioxidant activity should be considered, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of boldine might be related in part to its anti-inflammatory properties."
2015,26040026,Effect of ethanolic extract of Coriandrum sativum L. on tacrine induced orofacial dyskinesia.,"The effect of ethanolic extract of Coriandrum sativum L. seeds (100, 200 mg/kg) was studied on tacrine induced orofacial dyskinesia. Tacrine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) treated animals were observed for vacuous chewing movements (VCM), tongue protrusions (TP) and orofacial bursts (OB) for 1 h followed by observations for locomotor changes and cognitive dysfunction. Sub-chronic administration of Coriandrum sativum L. seed extract (E-CS) (100, 200 mg/kg, p.o., for 15 days significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the tacrine induced VCM, TP and OB; and also significantly (P < 0.05), increased locomotion and cognition compared to the tacrine treated group. Biochemical analysis revealed that tacrine administration significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSH) levels and also significantly (P < 0.05) increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) as an index of oxidative stress, whereas subchronic administration of E-CS significantly (P < 0.05) improved the antioxidant enzyme (i.e. SOD, CAT, and GSH) levels and also significantly (P < 0.05) decreased lipid peroxidation (LPO). The results have demonstrated the protective role of ethanolic extract of Coriandrum sativum. L against tacrine induced orofacial dyskinesia."
2011,25213950,Screening of selected Asian spices for anti obesity-related bioactivities.,"The potential health effects of 30 spices, commonly used for daily consumption, were submitted to bioactivity screening with several anti-obesity related bioassays: adenosine A1 receptor binding, cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding, TNF-α and 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation induction. Sesame seed and red chilli exhibited high binding activity to the adenosine A1 receptor and nutmeg, mace, black pepper and turmeric to the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, while piment and turmeric showed high inhibition of TNF-α accumulation. Black onion seed proved to be the only spice with high 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation induction activity. Several well known major compounds found in these active spices were tested with the respective bioassays but did not show activity. Thus, it appears that other minor compounds or the synergistic effects of different constituents are responsible for the observed activity. "
2017,29040957,Molecular docking and antiamnesic effects of nepitrin isolated from Rosmarinus officinalis on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice.,"Rosmarinus officinalis has long been known as the herb of remembrance. The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-amnesic effects of nepitrin isolated from Rosmarinus officinalis using in-vivo models of Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT) along with in vitro antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and buterylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition potential. Nepitrin showed a concentration dependent inhibition of AChE and BuChE enzymes with IC50 values of 65 and 72μg/mL, respectively and antioxidant activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) with IC50 values 270 and 210μg/mL, respectively. In mice, nepitrin reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine as indicated by a dose-dependent increase in spontaneous alternation performance in the Y-maze task (p <0.05 versus scopolamine) and increase in the discrimination index in the novel object recognition test (NORT) comparable to the standard drug donepezil 2mg/kg. Molecular docking studies were performed and the GlideScore of nepitrin was consistent with its experimental AChE inhibitory activities. Nepitrin occupied the same binding site forming similar interactions to those formed by donepezil in the crystal structure. Thus, nepitrin could provide a lead for the development of therapeutic agent useful in cognition and memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease."
2019,30372953,The AP2/ERF transcription factor SmERF1L1 regulates the biosynthesis of tanshinones and phenolic acids in Salvia miltiorrhiza.,"Tanshinones and phenolic acids are two important metabolites synthesized by the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza. There is increasing market demand for these compounds. Here, we isolated and functionally characterized SmERF1L1, a novel JA (Jasmonic acid)-responsive gene encoding AP2/ERF transcription factor, from Salvia miltiorrhiza. SmERF1L1 was responsive to methyl jasmonate (MJ), yeast extraction (YE), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene treatments. Subcellular localization assay indicated that SmERF1L1 located in the nucleus. Overexpression of SmERF1L1 significantly increased tanshinones production in transgenic S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots by comprehensively upregulating tanshinone biosynthetic pathway genes, especially SmDXR. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that SmERF1L1 binds to the GCC-box of SmDXR promoter while dual luciferase (Dual-LUC) assay showed that SmERF1L1 positively regulated the expression of SmDXR. Our study suggested that the SmERF1L1 may be a good potential target for further metabolic engineering of bioactive component biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza."
2016,26066527,Zinc Chloride and Lead Acetate-Induced Passive Avoidance Memory Retention Deficits Reversed by Nicotine and Bucladesine in Mice.,"It is very important to investigate the neurotoxic effects of metals on learning and memory processes. In this study, we tried to investigate the effects and time course properties of oral administration of zinc chloride (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg, for 2 weeks), lead acetate (250, 750, 1,500, and 2,500 ppm for 4, 6 and 8 weeks), and their possible mechanisms on a model of memory function. For this matter, we examined the intra-peritoneal injections of nicotine (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg) and bucladesine (50, 100, 300, and 600 nM/mouse) for 4 days alone and in combination with mentioned metals in the step-through passive avoidance task. Control animals received saline, drinking water, saline, and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)/deionized water (1:9), respectively. At the end of each part of studies, animals were trained for 1 day in step-through task. The avoidance memory retention alterations were evaluated 24 and 48 h later in singular and combinational studies. Zinc chloride (75 mg/kg) oral gavage for 2 weeks decreased latency times compared to control animals. Also, lead acetate (750 ppm oral administrations for 8 weeks) caused significant lead blood levels and induced avoidance memory retention impairments. Four-days intra-peritoneal injection of nicotine (1 mg/kg) increased latency time compared to control animals. Finally, findings of this research showed that treatment with intra-peritoneal injections of nicotine (1 mg/kg) and/or bucladesine (600 nM/mouse) reversed zinc chloride- and lead acetate-induced avoidance memory retention impairments. Taken together, these results showed the probable role of cholinergic system and protein kinase A pathways in zinc chloride- and lead acetate-induced avoidance memory alterations. "
2016,26076900,Effects of an antidepressant mixture on the brain serotonin and predation behavior of hybrid striped bass.,"Antidepressants have been found in measurable concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent and receiving waters throughout the world. Studies have shown that these concentrations are typically not overtly toxic, but the psychotropic mode of action of these chemicals warrants examination of their behavioral effects. Exposure of hybrid striped bass to the antidepressants fluoxetine or venlafaxine alone has been shown to cause decreased brain serotonin levels and increased time to capture prey at concentrations typically 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, equally effective doses of fluoxetine and venlafaxine were used to perform a mixture study, using a toxic unit approach to determine whether these antidepressants may act in an additive manner at lower concentrations. The results indicated that mixtures of these antidepressants caused decreased brain serotonin and increased time to capture prey at concentrations lower than reported in previous studies. Low concentration mixtures caused an additive effect on brain serotonin levels and time to capture prey, whereas higher concentrations were less than additive. The results were consistent with the dose addition concept, with higher concentration mixtures potentially saturating the effects on serotonin in the brain. Results from the present study indicate that antidepressants have the potential to be additive on the biochemical and individual scale, which necessitates more robust analysis of antidepressant mixtures and their potential to act together in low concentration scenarios."
2017,28159272,Improving fermented quality of cider vinegar via rational nutrient feeding strategy.,"This work aimed to find a rational nutrient feeding strategy for cider vinegar fermentation based on adequate information on the nutritional requirement of acetic acid bacteria. Through single nutrient lack experiment assay, necessary nutrient recipe for Acetobacter pasteurianus CICIM B7003 in acetous fermentation was confirmed. Compounds from the essential nutrient recipe were tested further to find out the key substrates significantly influencing cider vinegar fermentation. The findings showed that aspartate, glutamate, proline and tryptophan should be considered in detail for optimizing nutritional composition of cider. Finally, a nutrient feeding strategy that simultaneously adds proline, glutamate, aspartate and tryptophan to form final concentrations of 0.02g/L, 0.03g/L, 0.01g/L and 0.005g/L in cider was achieved by orthogonal experiment design. Comparing to the original fermentation, the yield of acetic acid from alcohol reached 93.3% and the concentration of most volatile flavor compounds increased with the rational nutrient feeding strategy."
2014,24757415,Renoprotective effect of Egyptian cape gooseberry fruit (Physalis peruviana L.) against acute renal injury in rats.,"This study aimed to evaluate the renoprotective effect of Physalis peruviana L. extract (PPE) on acute renal injury in rats. Adult male rats (n = 36) were divided into six groups that were fed with basal diet throughout the experiment (33 days). The first group was normal group, the second and the third groups were administered orally with 100 and 150 mg PPE/kg body weight (BW) respectively, the fourth group was injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg BW cisplatin once on the 28th day to induced ARI, and the fifth and sixth groups were treated like the second and the third groups and were injected with cisplatin on the 28th day. Many bioactive compounds were found in PPE. PPE did not cause any changes in the second and third groups compared to normal control group. Administration of PPE prior to cisplatin injection caused significant reduction in relative kidney weight, serum creatinine, urea, blood urea nitrogen, and significant increments in body weight, feed intake, total protein, albumin, and total globulin compared to cisplatin group. Pretreatment with PPE improved kidney histology and diminished the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and enhanced other antioxidant enzymes in kidney homogenate compared to cisplatin group."
1995,7711925,Possible concentration-dependent suppression of immune response by verapamil.,"Calcium channel blockers inhibit in vitro the lymphocyte response to mitogens and the generation of cytotoxic T-cell and natural killer cell activity. We report on a patient taking verapamil hydrochloride who experienced repeated, prolonged viral infections. His lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and tetanus antigen were suppressed; the mononuclear response to soluble tetanus was markedly diminished; and there was no response to influenza vaccination. On lowering the verapamil dose, or changing therapy to clonidine hydrochloride, all the above-mentioned functions returned to normal and a response to influenza vaccination was observed. We speculate that the prolonged viral infection observed in this patient may have been caused by suppression of the immune response by verapamil and we encourage further boad-based studies."
2013,24235816,New and emerging treatments for symptomatic tardive dyskinesia.,"The aim of this review is to assess new, emerging, and experimental treatment options for tardive dyskinesia (TD). The methods to obtain relevant studies for review included a MEDLINE search and a review of studies in English, along with checking reference lists of articles. The leading explanatory models of TD development include dopamine receptor supersensitivity, GABA depletion, cholinergic deficiency, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, changes in synaptic plasticity, and defective neuroadaptive signaling. As such, a wide range of treatment options are available. To provide a complete summary of choices we review atypical antipsychotics along with resveratrol, botulinum toxin, Ginkgo biloba, tetrabenazine, clonazepam, melatonin, essential fatty acids, zonisamide, levetiracetam, branched-chain amino acids, drug combinations, and invasive surgical treatments. There is currently no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for TD; however, prudent use of atypical antipsychotics with routine monitoring remain the cornerstone of therapy, with experimental treatment options available for further management.

1988,3285677,Detection of glomerular sialic acids in patients with diabetic nephropathy.,"A study on immunofluorescence of sialic acids in glomeruli from patients with diabetic nephropathy is described. Measurement of sialic acid in sera from 25 patients with diabetes mellitus was also performed. Renal biopsy specimens from 12 patients with diabetic nephropathy were stained with FITC-labeled antihuman IgG antiserum and rhodamine-labeled Triticum vulgaris (WGA) or Limulus polyphemus (LPA). These specimens were also stained with such reagents after treatment with neuraminidase, trypsin or citrate buffer. Both deposition of IgG and binding of WGA in the glomerular capillary walls were observed in all patients with diabetic nephropathy. The binding of WGA in the glomerular capillary walls in diabetic nephropathy was significantly increased compared with that in four normal renal tissues. However, the binding of LPA was hardly observed in the glomerular capillary walls of patients with diabetic nephropathy. The binding of WGA in the glomeruli was markedly decreased after treatment with neuraminidase although it was hardly decreased after treatment with trypsin or citrate buffer. The levels of sialic acid in sera from patients with diabetic nephropathy were markedly increased. It is suggested that accumulated substances in the glomerular capillary walls with an affinity for WGA are mainly composed of N-acetyl glucosamine and/or N-acetyl neuraminic acid in patients with diabetic nephropathy."
2016,27776556,Alkaloids from piper longum protect dopaminergic neurons against inflammation-mediated damage induced by intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide.,"Alkaloids from Piper longum (PLA), extracted from P. longum, have potent anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PLA could protect dopaminergic neurons against inflammation-mediated damage by inhibiting microglial activation using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage rat model.The animal behaviors of rotational behavior, rotarod test and open-field test were investigated. The survival ratio of dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation were examined. The dopamine (DA) and its metabolite were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of PLA on the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) were also estimated.We showed that the survival ratio of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and DA content in the striatum were reduced after a single intranigral dose of LPS (10 μg) treatment. The survival rate of TH-ir neurons in the SNpc and DA levels in the striatum were significantly improved after treatment with PLA for 6 weeks. The over-activated microglial cells were suppressed by PLA treatment. We also observed that the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were decreased and the excessive production of ROS and NO were abolished after PLA treatment. Therefore, the behavioral dysfunctions induced by LPS were improved after PLA treatment.This study suggests that PLA plays a significant role in protecting dopaminergic neurons against inflammatory reaction induced damage."
2019,31290076,Prasterone: A Review in Vulvovaginal Atrophy.,"Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a progressive condition commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The cessation of ovarian estrogen secretion and a fall in serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the remaining source of estrogens and androgens, are thought to promote the development of VVA in this population. Intravaginal prasterone (Intrarosa®) is a synthetic form of DHEA indicated for the treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women presenting with moderate to severe symptoms in the EU; prasterone is also approved in the USA for the treatment of dyspareunia due to menopause. Approval for the treatment of VVA was based on the results of the phase III ERC-231 and -238 trials in which intravaginal prasterone 6.5 mg/day significantly improved the signs and symptoms of VVA (as assessed by the percentage of parabasal and superficial cells, vaginal pH and the severity of dyspareunia) compared with placebo. The beneficial effects of prasterone were also evident during 52 weeks' treatment in the phase III ERC-230 safety trial. Prasterone was generally well tolerated, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse event being application site discharge. During 52 weeks of treatment with prasterone, changes in serum concentrations of estrogenic and androgenic metabolites of DHEA increased from baseline but remained within the normal postmenopausal ranges. Thus, intravaginal prasterone is an effective and generally well-tolerated option for the treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women."
2007,18057734,Testosterone 5alpha-reductase inhibitory active constituents of Piper nigrum leaf.,"Previously we reported that Piper nigrum leaf extract showed a potent stimulation effect on melanogenesis and that (-)-cubebin (1) and (-)-3,4-dimethoxy-3,4-desmethylenedioxycubebin (2) were isolated as active constituents. As a part of our continuous studies on Piper species for the development of cosmetic hair-care agents, testosterone 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activity of aqueous ethanolic extracts obtained from several different parts of six Piper species, namely Piper nigrum, P. methysticum, P. betle, P. kadsura, P. longum, and P. cubeba, were examined. Among them, the extracts of P. nigrum leaf, P. nigrum fruit and P. cubeba fruit showed potent inhibitory activity. Activity-guided fractionation of P. nigrum leaf extract led to the isolation of 1 and 2. Fruits of P. cubeba contain 1 as a major lignan, thus inhibitory activity of the fruit may be attributable to 1. As a result of further assay on other known constituents of the cited Piper species, it was found that piperine, a major alkaloid amide of P. nigrum fruit, showed potent inhibitory activity, thus a part of the inhibitory activity of P. nigrum fruit may depend on piperine. The 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activities of 1 and piperine were found for the first time. In addition, the P. nigrum leaf extract showed in vivo anti-androgenic activity using the hair regrowth assay in testosterone sensitive male C57Black/6CrSlc strain mice."
2008,26047282,Inhibitors of lactic acid fermentation in Spanish-style green olive brines of the Manzanilla variety.,"Frequently, a delay or lack of lactic acid fermentation occurs during the processing of Spanish-style green olives, in particular of the Manzanilla variety. Many variables can affect the progress of fermentation such as temperature, nutrients, salt concentration, antimicrobials in brines, and others. In this study, it was demonstrated that an inappropriate alkaline treatment (low NaOH strength and insufficient alkali penetration) allowed for the presence of several antimicrobial compounds in brines, which inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus pentosus. These substances were the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid either free or linked to hydroxytyrosol and an isomer of oleoside 11-methyl ester. Olive brines, from olives treated with a NaOH solution of low concentration up to 1/2 the distance to the pit, contained these antimicrobials, and no lactic acid fermentation took place in them. By contrast, a more intense alkaline treatment (2/3 lye depth penetration) gave rise to an abundant growth of lactic acid bacteria without any antimicrobial in brines. Therefore, the precise cause of stuck fermentation in Manzanilla olive brines was demonstrated for the first time and this finding will contribute to better understand the table olive fermentation process.

2010,20208364,Immunochemical detection of food-derived isothiocyanate as a lysine conjugate.,"In a previous study we prepared monoclonal antibody against allyl isothiocyanate (AITC)-modified lysine (Lys), and found that AITC reacted with Lys under physiological conditions in vitro (T. Nakamura et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol., 22, 536-542 (2009)). In the present study, antibodies against benzyl isothiocyanate (ITC), 6-methylsulfinylhexyl ITC and phenethyl ITC modified protein were prepared, and the respective monoclonal antibodies, B6C9, 6MS3D10, and PE3A10 were obtained. These antibodies were applied to ITC detection in food using shredded Wasabia japonica (wasabi) and ground Carica papaya (papaya) seed by trapping ITC with biotin-labeled bovine serum albumin. ITC formation from the wasabi and papaya seed samples was confirmed using the antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. These antibodies might be applicable in identifying food-derived ITC."
2016,26883702,"Successful Therapy of Murine Visceral Leishmaniasis with Astrakurkurone, a Triterpene Isolated from the Mushroom Astraeus hygrometricus, Involves the Induction of Protective Cell-Mediated Immunity and TLR9.","In our previous report, we showed that astrakurkurone, a triterpene isolated from the Indian mushroom Astraeus hygrometricus (Pers.) Morgan, induced reactive oxygen species, leading to apoptosis in Leishmania donovani promastigotes, and also was effective in inhibiting intracellular amastigotes at the 50% inhibitory concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. The aim of the present study is to characterize the associated immunomodulatory potentials and cellular activation provided by astrakurkurone, leading to effective antileishmanial activity in vitro and in vivo Astrakurkurone-mediated antileishmanial activity was evaluated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. The involvement of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) was studied by in vitro assay in the presence of a TLR9 agonist and antagonist and by in silico modeling of a three-dimensional structure of the ectodomain of TLR9 and its interaction with astrakurkurone. Astrakurkurone caused a significant increase in TLR9 expression of L. donovani-infected macrophages along with the activation of proinflammatory responses. The involvement of TLR9 in astrakurkurone-mediated amastigote killing has been evidenced from the fact that a TLR9 agonist (CpG, ODN 1826) in combination with astrakurkurone enhanced the amastigote killing, while a TLR9 antagonist (bafilomycin A1) alone or in combination with astrakurkurone curbed the amastigote killing, which could be further justified by in silico evidence of docking between mouse TLR9 and astrakurkurone. Astrakurkurone was found to reduce the parasite burden in vivo by inducing protective cytokines, gamma interferon and interleukin 17. Moreover, astrakurkurone was nontoxic toward peripheral blood mononuclear cells of immunocompromised patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Astrakurkurone, a nontoxic antileishmanial, enhances the immune efficiency of host cells, leading to parasite clearance in vitro and in vivo."
2019,30724689,"Synergic Laxative Effects of an Herbal Mixture of Liriope platyphylla, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and Cinnamomum cassia in Loperamide-Induced Constipation of Sprague Dawley Rats.","Constipation is an acute or chronic illness attributed to various causes, ranging from lifestyle habits to side effects of a disease. To improve the laxative effects of some traditional medicines, herbal mixtures of Liriope platyphylla, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and Cinnamomum cassia (LGC) were evaluated for their mechanism of action and therapeutic effects in loperamide (Lop)-induced constipated Sprague Dawley rats by examining alterations in excretion parameters, histological structure, mucin secretion, and related protein levels. Food intake and water consumption were constant for all animals. We observed that the Lop+LGC-treated group had significantly greater excretion of stool and urine than was observed in the Lop+Vehicle-treated group. Administration of LGC in the constipation model restored the intestinal transit ratio to normal levels, and increased the number of goblet cells, mucosal layer, and muscle thickness. Mucin secretion was greater in the Lop+LGC-treated group than in the Lop+Vehicle-treated group, and the expression of MUC2 and AQP8 genes were also increased. In addition, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot revealed an increase in the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the Lop+LGC-treated group compared to the Lop+Vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, compared with the Lop+Vehicle-treated group, treatment with LGC reduced the phosphorylation of PKC and PI3K, and expression of Gα protein, but increased levels of IP3. Our results suggest that the traditional herbal mixture of LGC induces a potent laxative effect in Lop-induced constipation through mucosal tissue changes and mucin production. We also demonstrated that the laxative effect of LGC is closely related to the expression of mAChR and its downstream signals, suggesting the possibility of developing a constipation-laxative agent using LGC."
2016,27497728,Zidovudine and isoniazid induced liver toxicity and oxidative stress: Evaluation of mitigating properties of silibinin.,"HIV/AIDS patients are more prone for opportunistic TB infections and they are administered the combined regimen of anti-retroviral drug zidovudine (AZT) and isoniazid (INH) for therapy. However, AZT+INH treatment has been documented to induce injury and remedial measures to prevent this adversity are not clearly defined. Silibinin (SBN) is a natural hepatoprotective principle isolated from medicinal plant Silybum marianum and is currently used for therapy of various liver diseases. This study investigate the hepatotoxic potentials of AZT alone, INH alone and AZT+INH treatments and the mitigating potentials of SBN against these drugs induced toxic insults of liver in rats. Separate groups of rats (n=6 in each group) were administered AZT alone (50mg/kg b.w.), INH alone (25mg/kg, b.w.), AZT+INH (50mg/kg, b.w. and 25mg/kg, b.w.), SBN alone (100mg/kg, b.w.) and SBN+AZT+INH daily for sub-chronic period of 45days orally. The control rats received saline/propylene glycol. INH alone and AZT+INH-induced parenchymal cell injury and cholestasis of liver was evidenced by highly significant increase in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, argino succinic acid lyase), bilirubin, protein, oxidative stress parameters (lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, vitamins C and E) and membrane bound ATPases were evaluated in serum/liver tissue homogenates. Histopathological studies show ballooning degradation, inflammatory lesions, lipid deposition and hydropic changes in the liver tissue. All the above biochemical and pathological changes induced by AZT+INH treatments were mitigated in rats receiving SBN simultaneously with these hepatotoxins, indicating its hepatoprotective and antioxidant potentials against AZT+INH-induced hepatotoxicity. The moderate hepatoprotective and oxidant potentials of SBN could be due to its low bioavailability and this deficiency could be prevented by supplementation of phosphatidylcholines and studies are warranted on these lines to improve the therapeutic efficiency of SBN.

2011,21660532,Effects of manganese deficiency and added cerium on nitrogen metabolism of maize.,"Manganese is one of the essential microelements for plant growth, and cerium is a beneficial element for plant growth. However, whether manganese deficiency affects nitrogen metabolism of plants and cerium improves the nitrogen metabolism of plants by exposure to manganese-deficient media are still unclear. The main aim of the study was to determine the effects of manganese deficiency in nitrogen metabolism and the roles of cerium in the improvement of manganese-deficient effects in maize seedlings. Maize seedlings were cultivated in manganese present Meider's nutrient solution. They were subjected to manganese deficiency and to cerium chloride administered in the manganese-present and manganese-deficient media. Maize seedlings grown in the various media were measured for key enzyme activities involved in nitrogen metabolism, such as nitrate reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamic-oxaloace transaminase. We found that manganese deficiency restricted uptake and transport of NO(3)(-), inhibited activities of nitrogen-metabolism-related enzymes, such as nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamic-oxaloace transaminase, thus decreasing the synthesis of chlorophyll and soluble protein, and inhibited the growth of maize seedlings. Manganese deficiency promoted the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase and reduced the toxicity of excess ammonia to the plant, while added cerium relieved the damage to nitrogen metabolism caused by manganese deficiency in maize seedlings. However, cerium addition exerted positively to relieve the damage of nitrogen metabolism process in maize seedlings caused by exposure to manganese-deficient media."
1997,9280178,Alpha-linolenic acid and marine long-chain n-3 fatty acids differ only slightly in their effects on hemostatic factors in healthy subjects.,"The effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) on hemostatic factors were compared. Healthy subjects (29 women and 17 men aged 20-44 y) received either linseed oil (average ALA intake: 5.9 g/d) or fish oil plus sunflower oil (average EPA + DHA intake: 5.2 g/d) for 4 wk. The supplemented amount of fat was 1.19 mg/kJ (1 g/200 kcal) calculated energy expenditure. Stability of habitual diets was monitored. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at the end of the experimental period, and after a 12-wk follow-up period. Different changes in the study groups were seen only in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerols, platelet fatty acid composition, and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The treatments did not differ in their effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation and thromboxane production, aggregation to the thromboxane A2 mimic I-BOP, urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 and beta-thromboglobulin, bleeding time, plasma fibrinogen concentration, antithrombin III activity, factor VII coagulant activity, or activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. The results indicate that supplemented ALA from vegetable oil and EPA and DHA from a marine source have largely parallel effects on hemostatic factors."
2011,21787425,Polysaccharides from Agaricus bisporus and Agaricus brasiliensis show similarities in their structures and their immunomodulatory effects on human monocytic THP-1 cells.,"Mushroom polysaccharides have traditionally been used for the prevention and treatment of a multitude of disorders like infectious illnesses, cancers and various autoimmune diseases. Crude mushroom extracts have been tested without detailed chemical analyses of its polysaccharide content. For the present study we decided to chemically determine the carbohydrate composition of semi-purified extracts from 2 closely related and well known basidiomycete species, i.e. Agaricus bisporus and A. brasiliensis and to study their effects on the innate immune system, in particular on the in vitro induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, using THP-1 cells.Mushroom polysaccharide extracts were prepared by hot water extraction and precipitation with ethanol. Their composition was analyzed by GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. PMA activated THP-1 cells were treated with the extracts under different conditions and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated by qPCR.Semi-purified polysaccharide extracts of A. bisporus and A. brasiliensis (= blazei) were found to contain (1→6),(1→4)-linked α-glucan, (1→6)-linked β-glucan, and mannogalactan. Their proportions were determined by integration of 1H-NMR signs, and were considerably different for the two species. A. brasiliensis showed a higher content of β-glucan, while A. bisporus presented mannogalactan as its main polysaccharide. The extracts induced a comparable increase of transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes IL-1β and TNF-α as well as of COX-2 in PMA differentiated THP-1 cells. Pro-inflammatory effects of bacterial LPS in this assay could be reduced significantly by the simultaneous addition of A. brasiliensis extract.The polysaccharide preparations from the closely related species A. bisporus and A. brasiliensis show major differences in composition: A. bisporus shows high mannogalactan content whereas A. brasiliensis has mostly β-glucan. Semi-purified polysaccharide extracts from both Agaricus species stimulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, while the polysaccharide extract of A. brasiliensis reduced synthesis of these cytokines induced by LPS, suggesting programmable immunomodulation."
2003,12970085,"Interactions of androgens, green tea catechins and the antiandrogen flutamide with the external glucose-binding site of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter GLUT1.","This study investigates the effects of androgens, the antiandrogen flutamide and green tea catechins on glucose transport inhibition in human erythrocytes. These effects may relate to the antidiabetogenic effects of green tea. Testosterone, 4-androstene-3,17-dione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-3-acetate inhibit glucose exit from human erythrocytes with half-maximal inhibitions (Ki) of 39.2+/-8.9, 29.6+/-3.7, 48.1+/-10.2 and 4.8+/-0.98 microM, respectively. The antiandrogen flutamide competitively relieves these inhibitions and of phloretin. Dehydrotestosterone has no effect on glucose transport, indicating the differences between androgen interaction with GLUT1 and human androgen receptor (hAR). Green tea catechins also inhibit glucose exit from erythrocytes. Epicatechin 3-gallate (ECG) has a Ki ECG of 0.14+/-0.01 microM, and epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) has a Ki EGCG of 0.97+/-0.13 microM. Flutamide reverses these effects. Androgen-screening tests show that the green tea catechins do not act genomically. The high affinities of ECG and EGCG for GLUT1 indicate that this might be their physiological site of action. There are sequence homologies between GLUT1 and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of hAR containing the amino-acid triads Arg 126, Thr 30 and Asn 288, and Arg 126, Thr 30 and Asn 29, with similar 3D topology to the polar groups binding 3-keto and 17-beta OH steroid groups in hAR LBD. These triads are appropriately sited for competitive inhibition of glucose import at the external opening of the hydrophilic pore traversing GLUT1."
2010,20045943,Evaluation of selective competitive binding of basic drugs to alpha1-acid glycoprotein variants.,"We examined the binding of various basic drugs to the F(1)S and A genetic variants of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which were isolated from native human commercial AGP (total AGP) by chromatography on an immobilized copper(II) affinity adsorbent. The values of the dissociation constant (K(d)) of some basic drugs with the F(1)S variant in equilibrium dialysis differed characteristically from those with the A variant. The selective binding to these variants was evaluated by measuring the displacement ratio of dicumarol bound to the F(1)S variant or that of acridine orange bound to the A variant, using circular dichroism spectroscopy. There was reasonably good agreement between the K(d) values and displacement ratios. There was a characteristic difference between the values of inhibition constant (K(i)) of basic drugs towards dipyridamole binding to F(1)S and towards disopyramide binding to A in total AGP. We found that the K(i) values for dipyridamole binding were well correlated with the K(d) values for the F(1)S variant, whereas those for disopyramide binding were well correlated with the K(d) values for the A variant. In conclusion, the higher the affinity of basic drugs for AGP, the more they inhibit the binding of other basic drugs, and further, the inhibitory potency depends on the selectivity of binding to the AGP variants."
2018,30019960,Antibacterial Effect of Essential Oils against Spoilage Bacteria from Vacuum-Packed Cooked Cured Sausages.,"Nonfermented sausages, which have a pH of around 6.0, a low salt concentration, and high moisture with a water activity higher than 0.95, are highly perishable. In this study, culture-dependent techniques and 16S rDNA approaches were used to identify the presumptive spoilage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sliced vacuum-packed cooked sausage during storage at 4°C. The antibacterial properties of essential oils (EOs) from the medicinal plants Carum carvi, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Curcuma longa, Citrus medica, and Eugenia caryophyllata against isolated LAB were also investigated. A total of 106 colonies were obtained on de Man Rogosa Sharpe medium after storage of sausages samples, and 16 isolates were identified from conventional morphological analysis of the bacterial populations. DNA extraction and 16S rDNA analysis indicated that Lactobacillus curvatus, Weissella viridescens, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus dextrinicus, Lactobacillus sakei, and Pediococcus dextrinicus were the main spoilage LAB. The antibacterial properties of EOs against isolated LAB were indicated by inhibition zones on culture plates of 7.8 to 31 mm, depending on the susceptibility of the tested LAB strain. The MICs and MBCs of five EOs were determined. The most effective EO against the LAB was C. zeylanicum followed by C. carvi and C. medica, and the least effective EO was C. longa. The EO from C. zeylanicum had the highest antimicrobial activity (lowest MICs) against LAB, with EO MICs of 4.66 to 5.33 μL/mL. The most susceptible isolate was L. mesenteroides, with a MIC of 4.66 μL/mL for the C. zeylanicum EO. These data indicate that the EO from C. zeylanicum could be used as a natural preservative for vacuum-packed emulsion-type sausage."
2015,25652210,Vitamin D binding protein genotype is associated with plasma 25OHD concentration in West African children.,"Vitamin D is well known for its role in promoting skeletal health. Vitamin D status is determined conventionally by circulating 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration. There is evidence indicating that circulating 25OHD concentration is affected by variation in Gc, the gene encoding the vitamin D binding protein (DBP). The composite genotype of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7041 and rs4588) results in different DBP isotypes (Gc1f, Gc1s and Gc2). The protein configurational differences among DBP isotypes affect DBP substrate binding affinity. The aims of this study were to determine 1) Gc variant frequencies in a population from an isolated rural region of The Gambia, West Africa (n=3129) with year-round opportunity for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and 2) the effects of Gc variants on 25OHD concentration (n=237) in a genetically representative sub-group of children (mean (SD) age: 11.9 (4.8) years). The distribution of Gc variants was Gc1f: 0.86, Gc1s: 0.11 and Gc2: 0.03. The mean (SD) concentration of 25OHD was 59.6 (12.9) nmol/L and was significantly higher in those homozygous for Gc1f compared to other Gc variants (60.7 (13.1) vs. 56.6 (12.1) nmol/L, P=0.03). Plasma 25OHD and 1,25(OH)2D concentration was significantly associated with parathyroid hormone in Gc1f-1f but not in the other Gc variants combined. This study demonstrates that different Gc variants are associated with different 25OHD concentrations in a rural Gambian population. Gc1f-1f, thought to have the highest affinity for 25OHD, had the highest 25OHD concentration compared with lower affinity Gc variants. The considerable difference in Gc1f frequency observed in Gambians compared with other non-West African populations and associated differences in plasma 25OHD concentration, may have implications for the way in which vitamin D status should be interpreted across different ancestral groups.

,11205276,Encapsulation of vinblastine into new liposome formulations prepared from triticum (wheat germ) lipids and its activity against human leukemic cell lines.,"Liposomes prepared from lipids isolated from Triticum sp. (wheat germ) were used to investigate the percentage of Vinblastine encapsulation and its retention into liposomes. The wheat germ total lipids (TL) were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method and the lipid classes have been isolated using chromatographic techniques. The type of lipids and their percentage content have been examined by TLC coupled with an FID (latroscan). Two liposomal formulations, i.e., I and II, with encapsulated vinblastine, and formulation III (empty liposomes) have been prepared by thin film hydration method. The cytotoxic/cytostatic activity of these liposomal formulations have been examined against nine human leukemic cell lines. The results showed that the percentage content of vinblastine into liposomes I and II depended on the lipid composition and it was greater into formulation II (> 90%). The retention of the drug into liposomes was studied and found to be time-dependent at 37 degrees C. For the cytotoxic/cytostatic activity, the parameters GI50, TGI, LC50 were estimated according to the instructions given by the NCI. The results show that formulation III (empty liposomes), exhibited a growth inhibiting activity, against the most tested cell lines. Formulation II showed mean of LC50 at 124.6 nM, mean of TGI at 71.6 nM and mean of GI50 at 30.8 nM."

2019,29855849,"Selenium Biofortification and Antioxidant Activity in Cordyceps militaris Supplied with Selenate, Selenite, or Selenomethionine.","Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element with multiple functions that may help mitigate adverse health conditions. Cordyceps militaris is an edible mushroom with medicinal properties. The experiment was conducted under artificial cultivation, with five Se concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg g-1) and three forms of Se (selenate, selenite, and selenomethionine). C. militaris can absorb inorganic from the substrate and convert it to organic Se compounds (selenocystine, selenomethionine, and an unknown species) in fruiting bodies. Compared with the control treatment, Se applications (40 μg g-1 selenate and selenite) significantly increased the Se concentration in fruiting bodies by 130.9 and 128.1 μg g-1, respectively. The biofortification with selenate and selenite did not affect fruiting body production, in some case, but did enhance the biological efficiency. Moreover, the abundance of cordycepin and adenosine increased, while the amino acid contents remained relatively stable. Meanwhile, Se-biofortified C. militaris showed effective antioxidant activities. These results suggest that Se-biofortified C. militaris fruiting bodies may enhance human and animal health when it was included as part of a healthy diet or used as Se supplements."
2013,23790948,Thermogenesis is involved in the body-fat lowering effects of resveratrol in rats.,"The effect of resveratrol on thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) was investigated. Rats were fed an obesogenic diet supplemented with resveratrol (30mg/kg/day) or not supplemented for 6weeks. Resveratrol intake led to increased gene expression of mitochondrial-transcription-factor-A (TFAM), mitochondrial-protein-cytochrome-C-oxidase subunit-2 (COX2), sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) and proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-coactivator1-α (PGC-1α) in IBAT and increased UCP1protein expression; however, peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-α (PPARα) expression remained unchanged. In gastrocnemius muscle, resveratrol increased the gene expression of TFAM and COX2; however, no changes were observed in levels of SIRT1, PGC-1α and PPARβ/δ. Acetylated-PGC-1α was decreased in the resveratrol-treated group, indicating a higher level of activation, and a significant increase of UCP3 protein expression was observed in this group. The increases in UCP protein expression in two important thermogenic tissues after resveratrol treatment may contribute to increased whole-body energy dissipation, which may help to better understand the body-fat lowering effect of this polyphenol.

2014,24885446,Polygonum viviparum L. induces vasorelaxation in the rat thoracic aorta via activation of nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells.,"In the past several decades, Polygonum viviparum L. (PV) was reported to have antibacterial, antiulcer, antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antiarthritic properties. The anti-inflammatory pathway was recently elucidated through cytosolic nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 protein expression. PV is a perennial herb and widely distributed in high-elevation mountain regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau. In Tibetan traditional medicine, PV is usually used to boost the blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis. Therefore, this study focused on how PV improves the vascular circulation and acts on vascular tissues.In this study, we isolated aortas from Sprague-Dawley rats (male, weight about 250~350 g), and detected the effects of PV on phenylephrine (PE)-induced contraction and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) formation using aortic rings. In addition, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to exam nitric oxygen (NO) synthase (NOS) activity by directly measuring NO production in the culture medium. Endothelial (e) NOS phosphorylation, and cytosolic Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions were measured using a Western blot analysis.PV dose-dependently relaxed PE-induced contractions in endothelial-intact but not -denuded aorta. The concentration to produce 50% relaxation was 22.04±1.77 μg/ml. PV-induced vasorelaxation was markedly blocked by pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an NOS inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and hemoglobin, an NO scavenger. PV increased cGMP formation; however, this effect was also suppressed by co-pretreatment with l-NAME, MB, hemoglobin, and Ca2+-free medium. In HUVECs, PV increased NO formation, which was greatly attenuated by NOS inhibitors (L-NAME and L-NMMA) and by removing extracellular Ca2+ and chelating intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM. In addition, PV promoted eNOS phosphorylation, Nrf2 degradation, and HO-1 protein expression according to a Western blot analysis.The results suggest that PV possesses vasorelaxing action in an endothelium-dependent manner and works through activating Ca2+/calmodulin- dependent NO synthesis; when NO is released and then transferred to smooth muscle cells, NO activates guanylyl cyclase and increases cGMP formation, ultimately resulting in vasorelaxation. Thus, PV can be considered for application as a potential therapeutic approach for vascular-associated disorders."
2005,16272711,Antimutagenicity and cytotoxicity of the constituents from the aerial parts of Rumex acetosa.,"Four anthraquinones isolated for the first time from the aerial parts of Rumex acetosa (Polygonaceae), a Korean and a Japanese medicinal plant, and two synthetic derivatives were examined for their cytotoxicities against five cultured human tumor cell lines, i.e. A549 (non-small cell lung), SK-OV-3 (ovary), SK-MEL-2 (melanoma), XF498 (central nerve system) and HCY15 (colon), using the Sulfrhodamine-B method in vitro and antimutagenic activities by Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and SOS chromotest with E. coli PQ37. Among the tested compounds, emodin strongly inhibited the proliferation of each examined tumor cell line with IC50 values ranged from 2.94 to 3.64 microg/ml and showed potent antimutagenic activities with 71.5% and 53.3% at the concentration of 0.1 mg/plate against the mutagens, NPD and sodium azide, respectively. Its antigenotoxic activity was also very effective at the final concentration of 10 microg/reaction tube against the mutagens, MNNG and NQO by SOS chromotest, reducing the induction factors by 19.6% and 43.5%, respectively. The structure-activity correlation study suggests that an additional OH group at C-6 position in the anthraquinone nucleus may play an important role for their cytotoxicities and an introduction of OH- or OCH3 group at C-6 position is necessary for their antimutagenicities."
2015,25297453,Molecular mechanisms governing different pharmacokinetics of ginsenosides and potential for ginsenoside-perpetrated herb-drug interactions on OATP1B3.,"Ginsenosides are bioactive saponins derived from Panax notoginseng roots (Sanqi) and ginseng. Here, the molecular mechanisms governing differential pharmacokinetics of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenoside Rg1 , ginsenoside Re and notoginsenoside R1 and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd were elucidated.Interactions of ginsenosides with human and rat hepatobiliary transporters were characterized at the cellular and vesicular levels. A rifampin-based inhibition study in rats evaluated the in vivo role of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1b2. Plasma protein binding was assessed by equilibrium dialysis. Drug-drug interaction indices were calculated to estimate potential for clinically relevant ginsenoside-mediated interactions due to inhibition of human OATP1Bs.All the ginsenosides were bound to human OATP1B3 and rat Oatp1b2 but only the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides were transported. Human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/bile salt export pump (BSEP)/multidrug resistance protein-1 and rat Mrp2/Bcrp/Bsep also mediated the transport of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides. Glomerular-filtration-based renal excretion of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides was greater than that of the 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type counterparts due to differences in plasma protein binding. Rifampin-impaired hepatobiliary excretion of the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides was effectively compensated by the renal excretion in rats. The 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides were potent inhibitors of OATP1B3.Differences in hepatobiliary and in renal excretory clearances caused markedly different systemic exposure and different elimination kinetics between the two types of ginsenosides. Caution should be exercised with the long-circulating 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides as they could induce hepatobiliary herb-drug interactions, particularly when patients receive long-term therapies with high-dose i.v. Sanqi or ginseng extracts."
2015,26665296,Effect of Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. fruit extract on cysteamine induced duodenal ulcer in rats.,"The edible fruits of Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. are traditionally used for various gastric complications in India. Here, we investigated the antiulcer activity of hydroalcoholic fruit extract of P. dulce (HAEPD) by applying cysteamine induced duodenal ulcer model in rats. Duodenal ulcer was induced in male albino Wistar rats by oral administration of cysteamine @ 420 mg/kg body wt. as a single dose. The rats were pre-administered orally with HAEPD @ 200 mg/kg body wt. for 30 days prior to ulcer induction. Rats pre-administered with ranitidine @ 30 mg/kg body wt. served as reference drug control. Ulcer score, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glycoproteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione levels were measured in the duodenum. Rats pre-administered with the HAEPD showed significantly reduced ulcer score comparable to that of ranitidine pretreated rats. The co-administration of HAEPD lowered the TBARS level and also restored the levels of glycoproteins, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Histopathological observations confirmed the presence of inflammation, necrosis and hemorrhagic spots in the duodenum of ulcer control rats which were significantly reduced due to HAEPD treatment. No abnormal alterations were observed in normal rats treated with HAEPD at the dosage studied. The results demonstrated antioxidant and cytoprotective nature of P. dulce, and thereby its significant anti ulcer property."
2005,15826610,Serotonin glucuronidation by Ah receptor- and oxidative stress-inducible human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 in Caco-2 cells.,"Caco-2 cells are a widely used model in drug development to study intestinal drug transport and metabolism. Recently, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been characterized as a highly selective substrate of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A6 [Krishnaswamy S, Duan SX, von Moltke LL, Greenblatt DJ, Court MH. Validation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) as an in vitro substrate probe for human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6. Drug Metab Disp 2003; 31:133-9], an isoform which conjugates planar phenols and is inducible by Ah receptor agonists and by oxidative/electrophile stress. To gain more insight into intestinal 5-HT disposition, uptake and metabolism of this neurotransmitter was studied in Caco-2 cell monolayers. It was found that 5-HT was taken up from the basolateral and to a lesser extent from the apical surface. It was mainly excreted basolaterally as 5-HT glucuronide. 5-HT UGT activity and UGT1A6 mRNA were induced by Ah receptor agonists and by oxidative stress generated by tert-butylhydroquinone and by isomeric thymoquinone, a potential antitumor agent and constituent of Nigella sativa seeds, commonly used as a condiment in the Middle East. While UGT1A6 induction was clearly detectable in NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-deficient Caco-2 cells, it was not induced in NQO1-efficient HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. The results suggest that--in addition to its detoxification function--intestinal UGT1A6 contributes to intestinal homeostasis of 5-HT from dietary sources and from release by enterochromaffin cells."
2003,12941975,Agricultural management practices to sustain crop yields and improve soil and environmental qualities.,"In the past several decades, agricultural management practices consisting of intensive tillage and high rate of fertilization to improve crop yields have resulted in the degradation of soil and environmental qualities by increasing erosion and nutrient leaching in the groundwater and releasing greenhouses gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), that cause global warming in the atmosphere by oxidation of soil organic matter. Consequently, management practices that sustain crop yields and improve soil and environmental qualities are needed. This paper reviews the findings of the effects of tillage practices, cover crops, and nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on crop yields, soil organic carbon (C) and N concentrations, and nitrate (NO3)-N leaching from the soil. Studies indicate that conservation tillage, such as no-till or reduced till, can increase soil organic C and N concentrations at 0- to 20-cm depth by as much as 7-17% in 8 years compared with conventional tillage without significantly altering crop yields. Similarly, cover cropping and 80-180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) fertilization can increase soil organic C and N concentrations by as much as 4-12% compared with no cover cropping or N fertilization by increasing plant biomass and amount of C and N inputs to the soil. Reduced till, cover cropping, and decreased rate of N fertilization can reduce soil N leaching compared with conventional till, no cover cropping, and full rate of N fertilization. Management practices consisting of combinations of conservation tillage, mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops, and reduced rate of N fertilization have the potentials for sustaining crop yields, increasing soil C and N storage, and reducing soil N leaching, thereby helping to improve soil and water qualities. Economical and social analyses of such practices are needed to find whether they are cost effective and acceptable to the farmers."
2019,30372931,Fluorescence microscopy to monitor wine malolactic fermentation.,"Malolactic fermentation (MLF) is a natural and biological deacidification of wines and a required step for making premium red wines. MLF is carried out by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are present in the fermenting wines. Currently, real-time control of MLF is an issue of great interest as the classical plate count technique for assessing bacterial populations requires long incubation times that are not compatible with a tight control of MLF. The aim of this study was to apply fluorescence microscopy and the bacteria staining kit Live/Dead BacLight™ to quantify viable LAB populations in red wines undergoing MLF. This method proved to be a fast and reliable culture-independent method to monitor wine MLF. Moreover, comparison of bacterial population data obtained by fluorescence microscopy and classical plate counts of LAB populations allowed discriminating a population of fully active and culturable cells, from total viable cells that include cells in an intermediate unculturable state."
2018,29287328,Effects of low sulfur dioxide concentrations on bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties of Aglianico red wine.,"This study analyzed the effect of low sulfur dioxide concentrations on the chromatic properties, phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity of Aglianico red wines with respect to wines produced from conventional winemaking. We determined the phytochemical composition by spectrophotometric methods and HPLC-DAD analysis and the in vitro antioxidant activity of different wine samples by the ORAC assay. The main important classes of fluorophore molecules in red wine were identified by Front-Face fluorescence spectroscopy, and the emission intensity trend was investigated at various sulfur dioxide concentrations. Lastly, we tested the effects of both conventional and low sulfite wines on ex vivo human erythrocytes under oxidative stimulus by the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay and the hemolysis test. The addition of sulfur dioxide, which has well-known side effects, increased the content of certain bioactive components but did not raise the erythrocyte antioxidant capacity."
2004,14967065,The use of vitamin K in patients on anticoagulant therapy: a practical guide.,"Anticoagulation with antivitamin K (AVK) is very effective for primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic events. However, questions persist about the risks and management of over-anticoagulation. For reversal of excessive anticoagulation by warfarin, AVK withdrawal, oral or parenteral vitamin K administration, prothrombin complex or fresh frozen plasma may be used, depending on the excess of anticoagulation, the existence and site of active bleeding, patient characteristics and the indication for AVK. In over-anticoagulated patients, vitamin K aims at rapid lowering of the international normalized ratio (INR) into a safe range to reduce the risk of major bleeding and therefore improving patient outcome without exposing the patient to the risk of thromboembolism due to overcorrection, resistance to AVK, or an allergic reaction to the medication. The risk of bleeding increases dramatically when the INR exceeds 4.0-6.0, although the absolute risk of bleeding remains fairly low, <5.5 per 1000 per day. Patient characteristics, including advanced age, treated hypertension, history of stroke, and concomitant use of various drugs, affect the risk of bleeding. The absolute risk of thromboembolism associated with overcorrection appears to be in the same range as the risk of bleeding due to over-anticoagulation. The use of vitamin K in patients with warfarin over-anticoagulation lowers excessively elevated INR faster than withholding warfarin alone; however, it has not been clearly demonstrated that vitamin K treatment does, in fact, lower the risk of major hemorrhage. As vitamin K administration via the intravenous route may be complicated by anaphylactoid reactions, and via the subcutaneous route by cutaneous reactions, oral administration is preferred. A dose of 1-2.5mg of oral phytomenadione (vitamin K(1)), reduces the range of INR from 5.0-9.0 to 2.0-5.0 within 24-48 hours, and for an INR >10.0, a dose of 5mg may be more appropriate. Overcorrection of the INR or resistance to warfarin is unlikely if the above doses of vitamin K are used. Vitamin K is less effective for over-anticoagulation after treatment with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon than after treatment with warfarin."
2005,16034166,Effect of different zinc sources and levels on inhibition of the apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid of thymocytes in vitro.,"This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of zinc sulfate and zinc methionine (Zn-Met) and their levels on apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid of thymocytes and the possible mechanism. Dexamethasone was used to make the apoptosis model of thymocytes; zinc sulfate and zinc methionine were supplemented to the medium at levels of 0, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 microM. The activity of cells, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), DNA ladder pattern, intracellular calcium concentration, and the percentage of apoptosis nuclei were determined. Both ZnSO4 and Zn-Met could modulate apoptosis; they inhibited apoptosis and decreased DNA fragmentation. The regulation was concentration dependent. At levels of 50 and 100 microM, the effect of Zn-Met on inhibiting apoptosis was less efficient than that of ZnSO4 (p<0.05), but the activity of the cells cultured with Zn-Met was higher than those cultured with ZnSO4; they showed no difference in modulating apoptosis when added at levels of 500 and 1000 microM to the medium (p>0.05). Intracellular calcium concentrations of cells cultured with Zn-Met were higher than those cultured with ZnSO4 at the same levels. Zinc supplementation decreased the concentration of intracellular calcium significantly (p<0.05) and increased the activity of Cu,Zn-SOD in the extract of the cells (p<0.05). Both zinc sulfate and Zn-Met could modulate apoptosis of thymocytes induced by glucocorticoid; the mechanism might involve the exchange of intracellular calcium, the redox of cells, and the two forms of zinc might go different ways in the regulations."
2011,25212133,Effect of acid concentration and treatment time on acid-alcohol modified jackfruit seed starch properties.,"The properties of starch extracted from jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) seeds, collected from west Assam after acid-alcohol modification by short term treatment (ST) for 15-30min with concentrated hydrochloric acid and long term treatment (LT) for 1-15days with 1M hydrochloric acid, were investigated. Granule density, freeze thaw stability, solubility and light transmittance of the treated starches increased. A maximum decrease in the degree of polymerisation occurred in ST of 30min (2607.6). Jackfruit starch had 27.1±0.04% amylose content (db), which in ST initially decreased and then increased with the severity of treatment; in LT the effect was irregular. The pasting profile and granule morphology of the treated samples were severely modified. Native starch had the A-type crystalline pattern and crystalline structure increased on treatment. FTIR spectra revealed slight changes in bond stretching and bending. Colour measurement indicated that whiteness increased on treatment. Acid modified jackfruit seed starch can have applications in the food industry. "
2007,17129579,"Study of antimutagenic and antioxidant activities of gallic acid and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose from Pistacia lentiscus. Confirmation by microarray expression profiling.","In vitro antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of two polyphenols isolated from the fruits of Pistacia lentiscus was assessed. Antioxidant activity was determined by the ability of each compound to scavenge the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH*), to inhibit xanthine oxidase and to inhibit the lipid peroxidation induced by H(2)O(2) in K562 cell line. Antimutagenic activity was assayed with SOS chromotest using Escherichia coli PQ37 as tester strain and Comet assay using K562 cell line. 1,2,3,4,6-Pentagalloylglucose was found to be more effective to scavenge DPPH* radical and protect against lipid peroxidation. Moreover, these two compounds induced an inhibitory activity against nifuroxazide and aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity. The protective effect exhibited by these molecules was also determined by analysis of gene expression as response to an oxidative stress. For this purpose, we used a cDNA-microarray containing 82 genes related to cell defense, essentially represented by antioxidant and DNA repair proteins. We found that 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose induced a decrease in the expression of 11 transcripts related to antioxidant enzymes family (GPX1, TXN, AOE372, SHC1 and SEPW1) and DNA repair (POLD1, APEX, POLD2, MPG, PARP and XRCC5). The use of Gallic acid, induced expression of TXN, TXNRD1, AOE372, GSS (antioxidant enzymes) and LIG4, POLD2, MPG, GADD45A, PCNA, RPA2, DDIT3, HMOX2, XPA, TDG, ERCC1 and GTF2H1 (DNA repair) as well as the repression of GPX1, SEPW1, POLD1 and SHC1 gene expression."
2020,30835576,Review of Published Bitter Orange Extract and p-Synephrine Adverse Event Clinical Study Case Reports.,"p-Synephrine is the primary active ingredient in bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) extract and is present in other citrus species. This review summarizes all known case reports that have been published regarding adverse events associated with multi-ingredient dietary supplements containing bitter orange extract. A common characteristic of all the case studies was the assumption that if bitter orange extract is listed on the label of the product it is the most likely cause of any adverse effect, although in no case was the presence of p-synephrine determined or a direct link demonstrated. No case study reviewed the existing published literature, and all failed to note that numerous clinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects at commonly used doses. Most studies did not indicate the composition of the product involved, and no study analyzed the product in question. In no case was a direct correlation between the event and p-synephrine made. Although p-synephrine and ephedrine have some structural similarity, the structural differences result in markedly different pharmacokinetic, physiological, and pharmacological effects, and thus the effects produced by ephedrine cannot be extrapolated to p-synephrine."
2009,19745067,Evaluation of pentostatin in corticosteroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium study.,"There is no standard therapy for steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This problem is particularly daunting in children with chronic GVHD, whereby the effects of the disease and its treatment may impair normal growth and development. Children are also particularly vulnerable to failure and/or toxicity of therapy; for example, joint contractures or joint damage may result in life-long disability. The Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium performed a phase 2 trial of pentostatin for steroid-refractory chronic GVHD in 51 children (median age, 9.8 years) from 24 institutions. Overall response was 53% (95% confidence interval, 40%-64%), with a response of 59% (95% confidence interval, 42%-75%) in sclerosis. Thirteen subjects (25%) had toxicity requiring them to stop pentostatin. The drug had a significant steroid-sparing effect in those that responded. A trend was also observed toward increased survival at 3 years in responders versus nonresponders (69% vs 50%; P = .06). The intravenous administration of the drug ensures compliance in a patient group in which oral therapy is difficult to monitor. Pentostatin has activity in refractory chronic GVHD in children, and future studies, including treatment of children newly diagnosed with high-risk chronic GVHD, are warranted. The trial was registered at www.Clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00144430."
2009,19159436,Effects of niacin on cell adhesion and early atherogenesis: biochemical and functional findings in endothelial cells.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Increased expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and their ligands mediate essential processes in atherogenesis. Niacin reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications and total mortality. Further understanding is needed on effects of niacin on CAM, and its functional consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of niacin on CAM expression and monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured to reach 80-90% confluence before experiments were initiated. Cells were exposed to DME/F12 with selected concentrations of niacin. To elicit the expression of CAM, cells were stimulated by addition of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 or interferon-gamma. Lysate from the conditioned media was assayed for CAM. The effect of niacin on mRNA expression of ICAM-1 was studied using semi-quantitative analysis of ICAM-1 mRNA. Adhesion assays were performed with flow cytometry to study the functional significance of the effects niacin on CAM expression. Niacin significantly reduced ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 protein levels basally, and reduced the cytokine-induced rise in ICAM-1, with a similar effect for TNF-alpha-induced PECAM-1 rise. The decrease in TNF-alpha-induced rise in ICAM-1 level was associated with a reduction of NF-kappaB activation, a reduction in mRNA expression of ICAM-1, and a functional reduction in monocyte adhesion to cultured endothelial cells. Niacin reduces CAM expression and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Apart from its lipid-modifying effects, these pleiotropic effects of niacin may potentially contribute to the beneficial effects of risk reduction for atherosclerotic disease."
2012,22018225,Blueberry anthocyanins: protection against ageing and light-induced damage in retinal pigment epithelial cells.,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells are vital for retinal health. However, they are susceptible to injury with ageing and exposure to excessive light, including UV (100-380 nm) and visible (380-760 nm) radiation. To evaluate the protective effect of blueberry anthocyanins on RPE cells, in vitro cell models of replicative senescent and light-induced damage were established in the present study. After purification and fractionation, blueberry anthocyanin extracts (BAE) were yielded with total anthocyanin contents of 31·0 (SD 0·5) % and were used in this study. Replicative senescence of RPE cells was induced by repeatedly passaging cells from the fourth passage to the tenth. From the fifth passage, cultured RPE cells began to enter a replicative senescence, exhibiting reduced cell proliferation along with an increase in the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells. RPE cells maintained high cell viability (P < 0·01) and a low (P < 0·01) percentage of β-galactosidase-positive cells when treated with 0·1 μg/ml BAE. In contrast, after exposure to 2500 (SD 500) lx light (420-800 nm) for 12 h, RPE cells in the positive control (light exposure, no BAE treatment) exhibited premature senescence, low (P < 0·01) cell viability and increased (P < 0·01) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release compared with negative control cells, which were not subjected to light irradiation and BAE exposure. Correspondingly, BAE is beneficial to RPE cells by protecting these cells against light-induced damage through the suppression of ageing and apoptosis as well as the down-regulation of the over-expressed VEGF to normal level. These results demonstrate that BAE is efficacious against senescence and light-induced damage of RPE cells."
2010,20838210,Effects of positive and negative modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor complex on responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule of reinforcement in rats.,"Relatively little is known about the behavioral effects of the neurosteroids compared with other drugs that modulate the γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor complex. This study examined the acute effects of pregnanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in male rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule of reinforcement. For comparison, three positive modulators of the GABAA receptor (lorazepam, ethanol, and pentobarbital), one negative modulator (β-CCM), and one neutral modulator (flumazenil) were tested. Pregnanolone was also administered in combination with DHEA to test for antagonism between these substances. Pregnanolone, lorazepam, and pentobarbital produced increases in responding at intermediate doses, and ethanol and pentobarbital produced decreases in responding at the highest doses tested. However, all four drugs dose-dependently decreased reinforced responding by decreasing inter-response times. DHEA, β-CCM, and flumazenil did not increase responding at intermediate doses or decrease reinforced responding. DHEA did not competitively antagonize the disruptive effects of pregnanolone. In summary, pregnanolone and DHEA produced effects on differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate responding that are similar to other positive and negative GABAA modulators, respectively, and do not produce these effects through a single binding site.

2003,12523963,Primary cultures of human hepatocytes as a tool in cytotoxicity studies: cell protection against model toxins by flavonolignans obtained from Silybum marianum.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytoprotective effects upon primary human hepatocytes of silymarin extract and its main flavonolignans following exposure to the cytotoxic actions of model toxins. The conditions for the hepatocyte intoxication were optimised for allyl alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, D-galactosamine and paracetamol. Silymarin extract, silychristin and silydianin did not exert cytotoxicity (10-100 microM), whereas silybin and isosilybin at higher concentrations and after longer incubation periods were cytotoxic. All main flavonolignans of silymarin tested displayed concentration-dependent cytoprotection against the toxic effects of both allyl alcohol and carbon tetrachloride but neither paracetamol nor galactosamine. The best protection was achieved by silydianin and silychristin and to a lesser degree by silymarin, while silybin and isosilybin were less effective. It is concluded that these differing outcomes result from the varying abilities of the Silybum marianum substances tested to stabilize the cell membrane, exert antioxidant properties and exhibit intrinsic toxicity."
2009,19336890,High-dosage pyridoxine-induced auditory neuropathy and protection with coffee in mice.,"Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a hearing disorder characterized by an abnormal auditory brainstem response (ABR). This study examined experimental AN model induced in mice following increased dosages of pyridoxine. Induced AN was examined for < or =10 weeks following the last pyridoxine treatment. To assess AN, we evaluated the ABR, auditory middle latency response (AMLR), otoacoustic emission (OAE), and histochemical morphology of the auditory nerve. Pyridoxine-treated mice exhibited an increase in the hearing threshold shift and delayed latency of both ABR and AMLR in proportion to pyridoxine dosage. Additionally, the extent of auditory nerve fiber loss increased in a dose-dependent manner following pyridoxine intoxication. Coffee or trigonelline treatment ameliorated the hearing threshold shift, delayed latency of the auditory evoked potential, and improved sensory fiber loss induced by pyridoxine intoxication. The present findings demonstrate that high-dose pyridoxine administration can be used to produce a new mouse model for AN, and coffee or trigonelline as a main active compound of coffee extract can potentially facilitate recovery from pyridoxine-induced auditory neuropathy."
2005,15748702,"Antioxidant, prooxidant and cytotoxic activity of hydroxylated resveratrol analogues: structure-activity relationship.","Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring hydroxystilbene, is considered an essential antioxidative constituent of red wine possessing chemopreventive properties. However, resveratrol and even more its metabolite piceatannol were reported to have also cytostatic activities. In order to find out whether this is related to antioxidative properties of those compounds, we synthesized five other polyhydroxylated resveratrol analogues and studied structure-activity relationships between pro-/antioxidant properties and cytotoxicity. Radical scavenging experiments with O(2)(*-) (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide/electron spin resonance (DMPO/ESR)) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (photometry) revealed that 3,3',4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene (IC(50): 2.69microM; k(9): 443000M(-1)s(-1)), 3,4,4',5-tetrahydroxystilbene (IC(50): 41.5microM; k(9): 882000M(-1)s(-1)) and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene (IC(50): 5.02microM), exerted a more than 6600-fold higher antiradical activity than resveratrol and its two other analogues. Furthermore, in HL-60 leukemic cells hydroxystilbenes with ortho-hydroxyl groups exhibited a more than three-fold higher cytostatic activity compared to hydroxystilbenes with other substitution patterns. Oxidation of ortho-hydroxystilbenes in a microsomal model system resulted in the existence of ortho-semiquinones, which were observed by ESR spectroscopy. Further experiments revealed that these intermediates undergo redox-cycling thereby consuming additional oxygen and forming cytotoxic oxygen radicals. In contrast to compounds with other substitution patterns hydroxystilbenes with one or two resorcinol groups (compounds 1 and 3) did not show an additional oxygen consumption or semiquinone formation. These findings suggest that the increased cytotoxicity of ortho-hydroxystilbenes is related to the presence of ortho-semiquinones formed during metabolism or autoxidation."
1992,1368303,Purification and characterization of serine proteinase inhibitors form gourd (Lagenaria leucantha Rusby var. Gourda Makino) seeds.,"Gourd seed inhibitors were purified in the following manner: gourd seeds were ground and extracted with 10 mM ammonium carbonate, pH 7.8. The extract was precipitated with 65-90% acetone and the acetone precipitates were gel filtered in a Cellulofine GCL-90-m column. Fractions of 3000 Da showing trypsin inhibitory activity were combined and purified further by ion exchange and reversed phase chromatographies. Three inhibitors, LLTI-I, II, and III were thus purified to homogeneity and the amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were: [sequence: see text] The exact sequences are unique but very similar to proteinase inhibitors belonging to the squash family. Based on the sequence, it is assumed that the peptide bond (Arg-Ile) found in the three inhibitors is the reactive site for trypsin. The Ki values estimated for complexes of LLTI-I, II, and III with bovine trypsin were 3.6 x 10(-10) M, 6.5 x 10(-11) M, and 3.0 x 10(-11) M, respectively."
2014,24799232,Quality and antioxidant properties on sweet cherries as affected by preharvest salicylic and acetylsalicylic acids treatments.,"The effects of salicylic acid (SA) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatments during on-tree cherry growth and ripening on fruit quality attributes, especially those related with the content on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity were analysed in this research. For this purpose, two sweet cherry cultivars, 'Sweet Heart' and 'Sweet Late', were used and SA or ASA treatments, at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mM concentrations, were applied at three key points of fruit development (pit hardening, initial colour changes and onset of ripening). These treatments increased fruit weight and ameliorated quality attributes at commercial harvest, and led to cherries with higher concentration in total phenolics and in total anthocyanins, as well as higher antioxidant activity, in both hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions. Thus, preharvest treatments with SA or ASA could be promising tools to improve sweet cherry quality and health beneficial effects for consumers. "
1992,1368838,Amino acid sequences of trypsin inhibitors from oriental pickling melon (Cucumis melo L. var. Conomon Makino) seeds.,"Three inhibitors (CMCTI-I, II, and III) were isolated from oriental pickling melon (Cucumis melo L. var. Conomon Makino) seeds by acetone precipitation, gel filtration, and reversed phase chromatography. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were: [table; see text] The reactive sites (P1 and P1' sites) of these inhibitors are presumed to be the Lys-Ile indicated by an arrow, comparing them with other squash family inhibitors. All three inhibitors can inhibit lysyl endopeptidase and trypsin at the enzyme-inhibitor ratio of 1:1."
2017,28090048,Hyponatremia in an Elderly Patient due to Isolated Hypoaldosteronism Occurring after Licorice Withdrawal.,"Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte disorders encountered in the elderly. We present the case of an 81-year-old man who developed hyponatremia due to isolated hypoaldosteronism occurring after licorice withdrawal. He had severe hypokalemia with hypertension and was diagnosed with pseudoaldosteronism. He had been taking a very small dose of licorice as a mouth refresher since his early adulthood. Five months after licorice withdrawal, he developed hypovolemic hyponatremia, which was resolved with administration of fludrocortisone acetate. Our experience with this case suggests that isolated hypoaldosteronism occurring after licorice withdrawal should be considered as a potential cause of hyponatremia in elderly patients."
2012,29243636,Antioxidant properties and phytochemical composition of China-grown pomegranate seeds.,"Four cultivars of Shanxi-grown pomegranate seeds were investigated for their phytochemical composition and antioxidant properties. Pomegranate seed oils were extracted and analysed for their fatty acid profiles, and tocopherol and carotenoid contents. The defatted flours were extracted with 50% acetone or 80% methanol, and evaluated for levels of phenolics, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, and scavenging capacities against DPPH and ABTS+ and their ferric ion reducing abilities. Pomegranate seed oil was rich in punicic acid (73.5-78.8g/100g oil) and total tocopherols (5.3-12.0μmol/g). The 50% acetone and 80% methanol were appropriate solvents for extraction of total phenolic and total flavonoid, respectively. The four cultivars were significantly different in levels of phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins and their antioxidant properties (P<0.05), generally flowing an order: Suanshiliu>Tianhongdan>Sanbaitian≈Jingpitian. This study will assist in the cultivar selection of the above pomegranate seeds for commercial production to meet the market demand."
2007,17690408,Elimination of Onchocercia volvulus transmission in the Santa Rosa focus of Guatemala.,"To eliminate transmission of Onchocerca volvulus, semiannual mass treatment with ivermectin (Mectizan; donated by Merck & Co) has been underway in Guatemala since 2000. We applied the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) elimination criteria in the Santa Rosa focus of onchocerciasis transmission in Guatemala (10,923 persons at risk). No evidence of parasite DNA was found in 2,221 Simulium ochraceum vectors (one-sided 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-0.086%), and no IgG4 antibody positives to recombinant antigen OV16 were found in a sample of 3,232 school children (95% CI, 0-0.009%). We also found no evidence of microfilariae in the anterior segment of the eye in 363 area residents (95% CI, 0-0.08%). Our interpretation of these data, together with historical information, suggest that transmission of O. volvulus is permanently interrupted in Santa Rosa and that ivermectin treatments there can be halted."
2011,21554802,Hypocholesterolaemic effect of water-insoluble fish protein from Alaska pollock in ovariectomised rats is not abolished by methionine addition.,"The present study investigated whether the hypocholesterolaemic effect of water-insoluble fish protein (IFP) from Alaska pollock in ovariectomised (OVX) rats was affected by methionine (Met) addition. OVX rats (6 months old) were fed a cholesterol-free diet containing casein, IFP or IFP+Met as a protein source for 28 d. The ratio of Met:glycine was lower in the IFP and IFP+Met diets compared with the casein diet. Body-weight gain, food intake and liver lipids were not affected by the diet. Plasma total cholesterol concentration was lower in OVX rats fed the IFP diet compared with those fed the casein diet. The hypocholesterolaemic effect of the IFP diet was not abolished by Met addition. Amount of bile acids in the small-intestinal content and faecal excretion of bile acids were higher in OVX rats fed the IFP and IFP+Met diets compared with those fed the casein diet. Ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) mRNA level and faecal excretion of bile acids were significantly lower and higher, respectively, in OVX rats fed the IFP diet compared with those fed the casein diet, but not in those fed the IFP+Met diet. Thus, the hypocholesterolaemic effect of the IFP diet seems to be mediated by increased faecal excretion of bile acids coupled with decreased reabsorption of bile acids from the ileum through a decrease in IBAT and the change in cholesterol metabolism linked to the amino acid profile."
2008,18520050,"Chronic effects of berberine on blood, liver glucolipid metabolism and liver PPARs expression in diabetic hyperlipidemic rats.","Berberine is one of the main alkaloids of Rhizoma coptidis which has been used as a folk medicine to treat diabetes mellitus for more than 1400 years in China. To investigate the chronic effect of berberine on diabetic hyperlipidemic rats, fasted rats were intraperitoneally injected 35 mg/kg streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were admitted after 2 weeks and given a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia. The rats were divided into 7 groups at the end of week 16: normal and diabetic rats received no drug, 5 treatment groups were administered with either 75, 150, 300 mg/kg berberine, 100 mg/kg fenofibrate or 4 mg/kg rosiglitazone per day for 16 weeks, respectively. The blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipid metabolic parameters and hepatic glycogen and triglyceride were measured, and histopathology and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha/delta/gamma expression of liver were determined by hematoxylin eosin and immunohistochemical staining. Berberine reduced diabetic rats' body weight, liver weight and liver to body weight ratio. Berberine restored the increased blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and the decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI levels in diabetic rats to near the control ones. Berberine alleviated the pathological progression of liver and reverted the increased hepatic glycogen and triglyceride to near the control levels. Berberine increased PPARalpha/delta expression and reduced PPARgamma expression in liver of diabetic rat to near the control ones. Berberine improved glucolipid metabolism both in blood and liver in diabetic rats possibly through modulating the metabolic related PPARalpha/delta/gamma protein expression in liver."
2012,22975503,Meliacinolin: a potent α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitor isolated from Azadirachta indica leaves and in vivo antidiabetic property in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes in mice.,"In India, Azadirachta indica is typically known as 'neem tree' and its leaves has long been used in the ayurvedic medical tradition as a treatment for diabetes mellitus. In-depth chromatographic investigation on chloroform extract resulted in identification of one new tetranortriterpenoid. Structural elucidation was established on the basis of spectral data as 24,25,26,27-tetranor-apotirucalla-(apoeupha)-1α-senecioyloxy-3α,7α-dihydroxy-14,20,22-trien-21,23-epoxy named by us as meliacinolin (1). The present study investigated the effect hypoglycaemic, hypolipidemic, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, α-glucosidase and α-amylase of 1 from A. indica. Diabetic rats were treated with 1 for 28 d and a set of biochemical parameters were studied including: glucose level, total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, liver and muscle glycogen, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. We also looked into liver function by determining glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase and hexokinase activities, and the effect on insulin level. While in vitro inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzyme activities were used as indices of effect on glucose absorption. As a result we found that blood glucose level, serum biochemical parameters, hepatic enzymes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and insulin level were restored in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice to normal levels with 1. Meliacinolin inhibited α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities. We conclude that meliacinolin can efficiently inhibit insulin resistance, improvement of renal function, lipid abnormalities, and oxidative stress, indicating that its therapeutic properties may be due to the interaction of meliacinolin with multiple targets involved in diabetes pathogenesis. α-Glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitors offer an effective strategy to lower the levels of post prandial hyperglycemia prevents the digestion of carbohydrates."
2008,18981568,Neuroprotective effect of Sanguisorbae radix against oxidative stress-induced brain damage: in vitro and in vivo.,"Sanguisorbae radix (SR), the root of Sanguisorba officinalis L. (Rosaceae), has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory, anti-infectious and analgesic activities in Korea. Previous work has shown that SR prevents neuronal cell damage induced by Abeta (25--35) in cultured rat cortical neurons. The present study was carried out to further investigate the neuroprotective effect of SR on oxidative stress-induced toxicity in primary culture of rat cortical neurons, and on ischemia-induced brain damage in rats. SR, over a concentration range of 10--50 microg/ml, inhibited H2O2 (100 microM)-induced neuronal death, which was significantly inhibited by MK-801 (5 microM), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and verapamil (20 microM), an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker. Pretreatment of SR (10-50 microg/ml), MK-801 (5 microM), and verapamil (20 microM) inhibited H2O2-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measured by a fluorescent dye, Fluo-4 AM. SR (10-50 microg/ml) inhibited H2O2-induced glutamate release into medium measured by HPLC, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) measured by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). In vivo, SR prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion. The ischemic infarct and edema were significantly reduced in rats that received SR (10, 30 mg/kg, orally), with a corresponding improvement in neurological function. Catechin isolated from SR inhibited H2O2-induced neuronal death in cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that SR inhibits H2O2-induced neuronal death by interfering with the increase of [Ca2+]i, and inhibiting glutamate release and generation of ROS, and that the neuroprotective effect of SR against focal cerebral ischemic injury is due to its anti-oxidative effects. Thus SR might have therapeutic roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke."
2015,25559857,Resveratrol inhibits high glucose induced collagen upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts through regulating TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway.,"Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological process presented in a variety of diseases, including hypertension and diabetes. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) have been identified as the most important participants in the development of cardiac fibrosis. Exposure of cultured CFs to high glucose (HG) or angiotensin II (Ang II) resulted in increased collagen synthesis. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenol exhibiting anti-fibrosis effects in a number of different organs fibrosis process, whether Res can prevent HG and Ang II induced fibrosis response in CFs remains unclear. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of Res in HG and Ang II induced fibrosis response in CFs. We cultured rat CFs in either normal glucose (5.6 mM) or HG (25 mM) media in the presence of Res or not and the changes in collagens synthesis and TGF-β1 production were assessed by Real-time PCR, Western blotting, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, normal and diabetic mice (induced by single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg) via tail vein) receiving Res (10 mg/kg) were used to explore the effects of Res on cardiac fibrosis in vivo. Masson staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to visualize cardiac collagen deposition. Results indicate that CFs exposed to HG condition shows enhanced proliferation rate. Furthermore, in the presence of HG or Ang II, CFs exhibited increased collagens synthesis and TGF-β1 production. And these effects were abolished by Res intervention. In vivo results show that diabetic mice exhibit increased collagen deposition in the cardiac compared with the normal mice. And this change was prevented by the treatment of Res. These results suggest that Res possesses a potential antifibrogenic effect in hypertension and diabetes-related cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, the action mechanism is probably associated with its ability to reduce TGF-β1 content in CFs."
2011,21938566,Epigenetic CpG demethylation of the promoter and reactivation of the expression of Neurog1 by curcumin in prostate LNCaP cells.,"Curcumin (CUR), a major bioactive polyphenolic component from turmeric curry, Curcuma longa, has been shown to be a potent anti-cancer phytochemical with well-established anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects. Chromatin remodeling-related epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important mechanism of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and chemotherapy. CUR has been found to inhibit histone acetyltransferase activity, and it was also postulated to be a potential DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. In this study, we show that when human prostate LNCaP cells were treated with CUR, it led to demethylation of the first 14 CpG sites of the CpG island of the Neurog1 gene and restored the expression of this cancer-related CpG-methylation epigenome marker gene. At the protein level, CUR treatment had limited effects on the expression of epigenetic modifying proteins MBD2, MeCP2, DNMT1, and DNMT3a. Using ChIP assay, CUR decreased MeCP2 binding to the promoter of Neurog1 dramatically. CUR treatment showed different effects on the protein expression of HDACs, increasing the expression of HDAC1, 4, 5, and 8 but decreasing HDAC3. However, the total HDAC activity was decreased upon CUR treatment. Further analysis of the tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) showed that CUR decreased the enrichment of H3K27me3 at the Neurog1 promoter region as well as at the global level. Taken together, our present study provides evidence on the CpG demethylation ability of CUR on Neurog1 while activating its expression, suggesting a potential epigenetic modifying role for this phytochemical compound in human prostate cancer cells."
1991,1723582,[Massive pulmonary embolism disclosing thrombocytopenia induced by low molecular weight heparin. Therapeutic success of prostacyclin].,"The authors report a case of massive pulmonary embolism revealing thrombocytopenia induced by a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) initially proposed for the treatment of superficial phlebitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by in vitro aggregation tests and a fall in the platelet count when the LMWH was reintroduced. The outcome was clinically, angiographically and hematologically satisfactory in response to in situ treatment with prostaglandin, subsequently replaced by Vitamin K antagonists."
2013,23132631,Angelica keiskei ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory impairments in mice.,"Memory impairment is the most common symptom in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Angelica keiskei (AK) has traditionally been used as a diuretic, laxative, analeptic and galactagogue. However, the anti-amnesic effects of AK and its molecular mechanisms have yet to be clearly elucidated. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of AK on scopolamine-induced memory impairments in mice. The regulatory effect of AK on memory impairment was investigated using passive avoidance, Y-maze and the Morris water maze tasks. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay was performed to investigate the cholinergic antagonistic effect of AK in the hippocampus. The effect of AK on phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated by Western blot assays and immunohistochemistry. The findings showed that AK significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Increase of AChE activity caused by scopolamine was significantly attenuated by AK. Additionally, AK significantly recovered the phosphorylation of CREB and expression of BDNF reduced by scopolamine in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results provide experimental evidence that AK might be a useful agent in preventing deficit of learning and memory caused by AD and aging."
2019,30827602,Flavor formation in different production steps during the processing of cold-smoked Spanish mackerel.,"This study aimed to determine the changes in the flavor profile during different operating units when making cold-smoked Spanish mackerel. Sensory evaluation and instrumental analysis of tenderness were applied to optimize the processing parameters. For the overall odor perception, distinct odor among fresh and processed samples could be distinguished using electronic nose (e-Nose). Purge-and-trap (P&T) extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify volatile compounds. Alcohols were the major volatiles in Spanish mackerel over the whole processing, while 2-butanol was found in the highest concentration. Curing was an effective way to remove fishy odor. Drying decreased the concentration of volatiles, especially sulfur compounds. Odor formation in cold-smoked mackerel could be divided into four steps (curing, drying, cold smoking and heating) as a result of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)."
2008,18587418,Resveratrol reduces endothelial progenitor cells senescence through augmentation of telomerase activity by Akt-dependent mechanisms.,"Recent studies have shown that resveratrol increased endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) numbers and functional activity. However, the mechanisms remain to be determined. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased EPC numbers and activity were associated with the inhibition of EPC senescence, which involves activation of telomerase. Therefore, we investigated whether resveratrol inhibits the onset of EPC senescence through telomerase activation, leading to potentiation of cellular activity.After prolonged in vitro cultivation, EPCs were incubated with or without resveratrol. The senescence of EPCs were determined by acidic beta-galactosidase staining. The bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation assay or a modified Boyden chamber assay were employed to assess proliferative or migratory capacity, respectively. To further examine the underlying mechanisms of these effects, we measured telomerase activity and the phosphorylation of Akt by western blotting.Resveratrol dose dependently prevented the onset of EPCs senescence and increased the proliferation and migration of EPCs. The effect of resveratrol on senescence could not be abolished by eNOS inhibitor or by an oestrogenic receptor antagonist. Resveratrol significantly increased telomerase activity and Akt phosphorylation. Pre-treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, significantly attenuated resveratrol-induced telomerase activity.Resveratrol delayed the onset of EPC senescence and this effect was accompanied by activation of telomerase through the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. The inhibition of EPCs senescence by resveratrol might protect EPCs against dysfunction induced by pathological factors in vivo and improve EPC functional activities in a way that may be important for cell therapy."
2013,23126367,Grapefruit juice markedly increases the plasma concentrations and antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in healthy subjects.,"This study examined the effects of grapefruit juice on the new P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor, which is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.In a randomized crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers ingested 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water thrice daily for 4 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 90 mg dose of ticagrelor.Grapefruit juice increased ticagrelor geometric mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) to 165% (95% confidence interval 147, 184%) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0,∞)) to 221% of control (95% confidence interval 200, 245%). The Cmax and AUC(0,34 h) (P < 0.05) but not the AUC(0,∞) of the active metabolite C12490XX were decreased significantly. Grapefruit juice had a minor effect on ticagrelor elimination half-life prolonging it from 6.7 to 7.2 h (P = 0.036). In good correlation with the elevated plasma ticagrelor concentrations, grapefruit juice enhanced the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor, assessed with VerifyNow® and Multiplate® methods, and postponed the recovery of platelet reactivity.Grapefruit juice increased ticagrelor exposure by more than two-fold, leading to an enhanced and prolonged ticagrelor antiplatelet effect. The grapefruit juice-ticagrelor interaction seems clinically important and indicates the significance of intestinal metabolism to ticagrelor pharmacokinetics."
2015,25654134,Impact assessment of mercury accumulation and biochemical and molecular response of Mentha arvensis: a potential hyperaccumulator plant.,"The present study was focused on examining the effect of Hg oxidative stress induced physiochemical and genetic changes in M. arvensis seedlings. The growth rate of Hg treated seedlings was decreased to 56.1% and 41.5% in roots and shoots, respectively, compared to the control. Accumulation of Hg level in both roots and shoots was increased with increasing the concentration of Hg. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were found to be increased with increasing the Hg concentration up to 20 mg/L; however, it was decreased at 25 mg/L Hg concentration. The POX enzyme activity was positively correlated with Hg dose. The changes occurring in the random amplification of ploymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles generated from Hg treated seedlings included variations in band intensity, disappearance of bands, and appearance of new bands compared with the control seedlings. It was concluded that DNA polymorphisms observed with RAPD profile could be used as molecular marker for the evaluation of heavy metal induced genotoxic effects in plant species. The present results strongly suggested that Mentha arvensis could be used as a potential phytoremediator plant in mercury polluted environment."
2014,25045753,Effect of noni (Morinda citrifolia Linn.) fruit and its bioactive principles scopoletin and rutin on rat vas deferens contractility: an ex vivo study.,"This study examined the effect of methanolic extract of Morinda citrifolia Linn. (MMC) and its bioactive principles, scopoletin and rutin, on dopamine- and noradrenaline-evoked contractility in isolated rat vas deferens preparations. MMC (1-40 mg/mL), scopoletin (1-200 μg/mL), and rutin hydrate (0.6-312.6 μg/mL) dose-dependently inhibited the contractility evoked by submaximal concentrations of both dopamine and noradrenaline, respectively. Haloperidol and prazosin, reference dopamine D2, and α 1-adrenoceptors antagonists significantly reversed the dopamine- and noradrenaline-induced contractions, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, MMC per se at higher doses (60-100 mg/mL) showed dose-dependent contractile response in rat vas deferens which was partially inhibited by high doses of haloperidol but not by prazosin. These results demonstrated the biphasic effects of MMC on dopaminergic system; that is, antidopaminergic effect at lower concentrations (<40 mg/mL) and dopaminergic agonistic effect at higher concentrations (>60 mg/mL). However, similar contractile response at high doses of scopoletin (0.5-5 mg/mL) and rutin hydrate (0.5-5 mg/mL) per se was not observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bioactive principles of MMC, scopoletin, and rutin might be responsible for the antidopaminergic and antiadrenergic activities of MMC."
2002,12230103,Beneficial effects of Hippophae rhamnoides L. on nicotine induced oxidative stress in rat blood compared with vitamin E.,"The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Hippophae rhamnoides L. extract (HRe-1) and also vitamin E as a positive control on nicotine-induced oxidative stress in rat blood, specifically alterations in erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) level, activities of some erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes, and plasma vitamin E and A levels. The groups were: nicotine (0.5 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneal, i.p.); nicotine+vitamin E (75 mg/kg/d, intragastric, i.g.); nicotine+HRe-1 (1 ml/kg/d, i.g.); and control group (receiving only vehicles). There were 8 rats per group and the supplementation period was 3 weeks. Nicotine-induced increase in erythrocyte MDA level was prevented by both HRe-1 and vitamin E. Nicotine-induced decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was prevented by HRe-1, but not vitamin E. HRe-1 increased the erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity compared with nicotine and the vitamin E groups. Catalase activity was not affected. Vitamin E supplementation increased plasma vitamin E level. Plasma vitamin A level was higher in both vitamin E and HRe-1 supplemented groups compared with nicotine and control groups. The results suggest that HRe-1 extract can be used as a dietary supplement, especially by people who smoke, in order to prevent nicotine-induced oxidative stress."
2015,25976997,Effect of the refining process on Moringa oleifera seed oil quality.,"We evaluated the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of the oil extracted from the seeds of Moringa oleifera during its refining process. Refining is accomplished in three stages: neutralization, degumming, and bleaching. Four samples were analyzed, corresponding to each step of the processed and crude oil. Increases in the density, viscosity, saponification value and oxidation of the oil were detected during the refining, while the peroxide value and carotenoid content diminished. Moreover, the refractive index and iodine content were stable throughout the refining. Nine fatty acids were detected in all four samples, and there were no significant differences in their composition. Oleic acid was found in the largest amount, followed by palmitic acid and behenic acid. The crude, neutralized, and degummed oils showed high primary oxidation stability, while the bleached oil had a low incidence of secondary oxidation. "
2018,29984825,High-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in marginal zone lymphomas: a retrospective study by the EBMT Lymphoma Working Party and FIL-GITMO.,"The role of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is debatable. This study investigated the outcome and prognostic factors affecting the outcome of patients undergoing ASCT for MZL. Eligible patients had non-transformed nodal, extra-nodal (MALT) or splenic MZL (SMZL), aged ≥18 years, who underwent a first ASCT between1994 and 2013 and were reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Fondazione Italiana Linfomi or Gruppo Italiano Trapianto Di Midollo Osseo registries. The study included 199 patients, [111 MALT lymphoma, 55 nodal MZL (NMZL) and 33 SMZL]. Median age at transplantation was 56 years. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-8), including rituximab in 71%. 95% had chemosensitive disease. 89% received a chemotherapy-based high-dose regimen. There were no significant differences in patient and transplant characteristics between the 3 histological subtypes except for a lower percentage of patients previously treated with rituximab in the MALT sub-group and more transplants performed in recent years in the other sub-groups. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality were 38% and 9%, respectively. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 53% and 73%, respectively. Five-year cumulative incidence of second malignancies was 6%. Multivariate analysis revealed age ≥65 years was associated with a shorter EFS and OS. In addition, patients with SMZL had a shorter OS than those with MALT. ASCT may provide clinical benefit in MZL patients who have failed multiple lines of chemoimmunotherapy."
2017,28840622,Propolis in the prevention of oral mucositis in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy: A pilot randomised controlled trial.,"Chemo-induced oral mucositis (OM) is associated with significant symptoms, treatment delays and increased costs. This pilot randomised controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability and compliance with propolis in breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, testing preliminary clinical efficacy of propolis in the prevention of OM, and prospectively evaluating the incidence of OM. Sixty patients were randomised to receive either a dry extract of propolis with 8%-12% of galangin plus mouth rinsing with sodium bicarbonate (experimental arm), or mouth rinsing with sodium bicarbonate (control arm). OM was evaluated with the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 after 5, 10, 15 and 21 days of treatment. Compliance with, tolerability of propolis and adverse events were recorded. The incidence of OM was also prospectively evaluated for 6 months. Two patients (6.7%) manifested a suspected skin reaction to propolis. No patient in the experimental arm developed OM > G1, while in the control arm OM > G1 was 16.7% (p = .02). The incidence of OM ≥ G1 at the end of cycles 2-8 was higher at the second (25%) and fifth cycles (45.8%). Propolis plus bicarbonate was safe, well tolerated and promisingly effective in the prevention of OM in patients with breast cancer."
2007,17709912,Effects of Nigella sativa and human parathyroid hormone on bone mass and strength in diabetic rats.,"Osteoporosis is a major complication in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly in those with insulin dependency. Recently, many therapeutic effects of Nigella sativa L. (NS) extracts have been exhibited such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidiabetic with clinical and experimental studies. Mechanical strength in the femur and vertebrae increases with human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) treatment. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that combined treatment with NS and hPTH is more effective than treatment with NS or hPTH alone in improving bone mass, connectivity, and biomechanical behavior using the finite element method (FEM) in insulin-dependent diabetic rats. In the mechanical analysis, five rat bones (control, diabetic diabetic NS treated, diabetic hPTH treated, and diabetic NS + hPTH treated) have been studied for bending analysis using the finite element analysis program ANSYS. Combined treatment of NS and hPTH was more effective on bone histomorphometry and mechanical strength than treatment with NS or hPTH alone for streptozotocin-induced diabetic osteopenia, which notably decreased bone volume."
2008,18703023,Comparison of CYP1A2 and NAT2 phenotypes between black and white smokers.,"The lower incidence rate of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder in blacks than in whites may be due to racial differences in the catalytic activity of enzymes that metabolize carcinogenic arylamines in tobacco smoke. To examine this, we compared cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) and N-acetyltransferase-2 activities (NAT2) in black and white smokers using urinary caffeine metabolites as a probe for enzyme activity in a community-based study of 165 black and 183 white cigarette smokers. The paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine, 17X)/caffeine (trimethylxanthine, 137X) ratio or [17X+1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U)]/137X ratio was used as an indicator of CYP1A2 activity. The 5-acetyl-amino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU)/1-methylxanthine (1X) ratio indicated NAT2 activity. The odds ratio for the slow NAT2 phenotype associated with black race was 0.4; 95% confidence intervals 0.2-0.7. The putative combined low risk phenotype (slow CYP1A2/rapid NAT2) was more common in blacks than in whites (25% vs. 15%, P<0.02). There were no significant racial differences in slow and rapid CYP1A2 phenotypes, and in the combined slow NAT2/rapid CYP1A2 phenotype. Age, education, cigarette smoking amount, body mass index, GSTM1 and GSTM3 genotypes were unrelated to CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity. Intake of cruciferous vegetables (primarily broccoli), red meat, carrots, grapefruit and onions predicted CYP1A2 activity either for all subjects or in race-specific analyses. Carrot and grapefruit consumption was related to NAT2 activity. Collectively, these results indicated that phenotypic differences in NAT2 alone or in combination with CYP1A2 might help explain the higher incidence rates of transitional cell bladder cancer in whites."
2018,29602443,[Resistance to vitamin K antagonist revealing interaction with soy lecithin].,"Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are difficult to use because of a narrow therapeutic index and of a marked inter- and intra-individual variability among patients in the required dosage. This drug may interact with many other drugs and same with certain food compounds. We report the case of potential interaction between soy lecithin and Vitamin K antagonists in a 46 years-old woman. Subtherapeutic INR values were detected despite the increase gradually in dose and replacing acenocoumarol by fluindione. An enquiry of pharmacovigilance was conducted found the consumption of soy lecithin capsules. Fifteen days after its stopping, the INR values have really increased. Clinicians should think to the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and food supplement that is increasingly used."
2017,29166937,A putative Chondroprotective role for IL-1β and MPO in herbal treatment of experimental osteoarthritis.,"Herbal treatment may have a chondroprotective and therapeutic effect on Osteoarthritis (OA). We investigated the mechanism of action of ginger and curcumin rhizomes cultivated in Egypt in treatment of OA in rat model.Thirty-five albino rats were intra-articularly injected with Monosodium Iodoacetate in the knee joint. Ginger and curcumin was orally administered at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg (F200 and F400). Serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronic acid (HA), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) were measured using ELISA. The composition of the herbal formula hydro-ethanolic extract was characterized using UPLC-ESI-MS. Histopathological changes in injected joints was examined using routine histopathology. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA.Serum levels of COMP, HA, MPO, MDA, and IL-1β were significantly decreased in F 200, F 400 and V groups when compared to OA group (P value <0.0001). On the other hand SOD levels were significantly elevated in treated groups compared to OA groups (P value <0.0001).The ginger/curcumin at 1:1 had chondroprotective effect via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect in rat OA model. Further pharmacological and clinical studies are needed to evaluate this effect."
2010,20350537,"Interaction study of two diterpenes, cryptotanshinone and dihydrotanshinone, to human acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by molecular docking and kinetic analysis.",Alzhemier's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia in the ageing population which is characterized by depositions of amyloids and a cholinergic neurotransmission deficit in the brain. Current therapeutic intervention for AD is primarily based on the inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to restore the brain acetylcholine level. Cryptotanshinone (CT) and dihydrotanshinone (DT) were diterpenoids extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. having anti-cholinesterase activity. Here we characterized the inhibition property of these two diterpenoids towards human AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Both CT and DT were found to be mixed non-competitive inhibitors for human AChE and an uncompetitive inhibitor for human BChE. The docking analyses of CT and DT into the active sites of both cholinesterases indicate that they interact with the allosteric site inside the active-site gorge mainly by hydrophobic interactions.
2016,27283688,Preparation of gluten free bread enriched with green mussel (Perna canaliculus) protein hydrolysates and characterization of peptides responsible for mussel flavour.,"Green mussel protein hydrolysates (GMPH) utilization for the enrichment of gluten-free bread followed by characterization of flavour peptides using chromatography and electronic nose techniques have been done. The degree of hydrolysis was carried out in each protease digest, and the higher degree of hydrolysis was observed in pepsin digestion. Gluten-free (GF) bread was formulated by using buckwheat flour (BWF), rice flour (RF) and chickpea flour (CPF) (70:20:10) and GMPH were added in the range of 0-20% in the GF bread for enrichment with GMPH. Radar plot of the electronic nose analysis showed that the sensors P30/2, T30/1 and T70/2 had a higher response to the GF bread and GMPH. Consequently, the peptide sequence was obtained manually by ESI-MS spectra of GMPH (KGYSSYICDK) and F-II (SSYCIVKICDK). Flavour quality was 97% discriminately comparable to the GMPH and F-II fractions. Mussel flavoured GF bread can be included in the celiac diet. "
2011,21496279,Piper sarmentosum inhibits ICAM-1 and Nox4 gene expression in oxidative stress-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"Aqueous extract of Piper sarmentosum (AEPS) is known to possess antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic activities but the mechanism responsible for it remains unclear. In early part of atherosclerosis, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) induces the expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is the predominant source of superoxide in the endothelial cells whereas superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are the antioxidant enzymes responsible for inactivating reactive oxygen species. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of AEPS on the gene expression of NF-κB, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, Nox4, SOD1, CAT and GPx in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).HUVECs were divided into four groups:- control; treatment with 180 μM hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂); treatment with 150 μg/mL AEPS and concomitant treatment with AEPS and H₂O₂ for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from all the groups of HUVEC using TRI reagent. Subsequently, qPCR was carried out to determine the mRNA expression of NF-κB, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, Nox4, SOD1, CAT and GPx. The specificity of the reactions was verified using melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.When stimulated with H₂O₂, HUVECs expressed higher level of ICAM-1 (1.3-fold) and Nox4 (1.2-fold) mRNA expression. However, AEPS treatment led to a reduction in the mRNA expression of ICAM-1 (p < 0.01) and Nox4 (p < 0.05) in the H₂O₂-induced HUVECs. AEPS also upregulated the mRNA expression of SOD1 (p < 0.05), CAT (p < 0.01) and GPx (p < 0.05) in oxidative stress-induced HUVECs. There was no significant change in the mRNA expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin.The expressional suppression of ICAM-1 and Nox4 and induction of antioxidant enzymes might be an important component of the vascular protective effect of AEPS."
1989,2683409,Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in crustaceans.,"1. The hepatopancreas is the major site of cytochrome P450-dependent xenobiotic monooxygenation in crustacean species, but the presence of monooxygenase inhibitors in hepatopancreas microsomes and cytosol from many decapod species has impeded in vitro studies. Cytochrome P450 and monooxygenase activities have been reported in other crustacean organs including the antennal gland (green gland) and stomach. 2. NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity is often very low (typically less than 10 nmol cytochrome c reduced/min per mg microsomal protein) in hepatopancreas microsomes from crustacean species. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase activity has not yet been detected in crustacean hepatopancreas microsomes. 3. The cytochrome P450 present in hepatopancreas of several crab species and the spiny lobster has been resolved into several fractions by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. One form of cytochrome P450 from spiny lobster has been purified to 12 +/- 2 nmol/mg protein. 4. Reconstitution studies with spiny lobster hepatopancreas P450 have shown that the vertebrate sex steroids, progesterone and testosterone, are excellent substrates, whereas ecdysone--the crustacean molting hormone--is not a substrate. Activity was found with several xenobiotic substrates including benzphetamine, aminopyrine, benzo(a)pyrene, ethyl-, benzyl- and pentyl-phenoxazones and ethoxycoumarin. Highest activities (greater than 50 nmol/min per nmol P450) were found for N-demethylation of benzphetamine and aminopyrine. 5. The ability of agents which induce vertebrate cytochrome P450 to induce cytochrome P450 in crustaceans is still unclear. Some studies indicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but not phenobarbital-type inducers, could induce cytochrome P450 in crustaceans, whereas other studies showed no effect of either inducer type. Crustaceans are not as sensitive as fish to induction of P450 and monooxygenase activity."
2006,16729670,[Determination of vitamin K in aojiru (green juice) products by HPLC].,"A survey of vitamin K contents was carried out on 41 aojiru products and 10 vegetable juice products that were purchased from local markets. Aojiru is a health food made from green vegetables such as kale, ashitaba, mulberry leaf, barley grass and the like. The products are usually provided in various forms, such as frozen, powder and tablet. Vitamin K in samples was extracted with n-hexane, and separated on a C18 column with methanol-ethanol (95 : 5). After separation, vitamin K was converted to the hydroquinone form on a reduction column and determined with a fluorescence detector at lambdaex 240 nm and lambdaem 430 nm. The contents of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) in frozen samples (n = 8), powder samples (n = 26) and tablet samples (n=7) were 90-190, 410-3,300, and 640-3,100 microg/100 g, respectively, and that in vegetable juice (n= 10) was 1-12 microg/100 g. Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) was not detected. The daily intake of vitamin K from aojiru products was estimated to be 99-380, 20-250 and 27-210 microg/day for frozen, powder and tablet types, respectively. These results suggest that patients prescribed warfarin should take care about their intake of vitamin K from aojiru products."
2000,10792296,In vivo biotinylation studies: specificity of labelling of reticulated platelets by thiazole orange and mepacrine.,"Animal in vivo biotinylation studies have demonstrated that thiazole orange (TO) labels the youngest cells in the circulation. TO has since been widely used for the measurement of reticulated platelets. As recent findings suggest that at high concentrations TO also labels platelet dense granules non-specifically, the value of previous work is unclear. Mepacrine also labels platelet dense granules and can detect storage pool defects. In this study, a mouse in vivo biotinylation model was used to determine the specificity of TO and mepacrine staining on platelets recently released into the circulation. The mean life span of biotin/TO (low), biotin/TO (high) and mepacrine/TO dual-positive platelets was 1.4 d (SD 0.5), 2.2 d (SD 0.2) and 2.3 d (SD 0.3) respectively (n = 6) compared with a life span for biotin-positive platelets of 4.9 d (SD 1.6). TO (low), TO (high) and mepacrine labelled 8.0% (SD 3.1), 43.9% (SD 8.3) and 40.0% (SD 9.9) of the total platelet population respectively (results of 30 samples from six mice), which decreased to 6.8% (SD 3. 9), 26.6% (SD 6.9) and 25.7% (SD 10.6) after thrombin degranulation. The shorter life span and lack of thrombin sensitivity of TO (low)-positive platelets, suggests that TO (low) measures reticulated platelets specifically. The comparative life spans and thrombin sensitivity of TO (high) and mepacrine-positive platelets suggest that TO (high) labels platelet dense granules. These data also suggest that dense granules are lost during platelet ageing."
1993,8238089,Case report: amelioration of insulin resistance in diabetes with dehydroepiandrosterone.,"In hyperandrogenic females, the ratio of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to testosterone may be an important determinant of insulin sensitivity. This study involved changes in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism with therapeutic manipulation of DHEA (S)/testosterone in a female patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperandrogenism. Therapeutic intervention included 1-month treatment with 0.25 mg dexamethasone at bedtime and 1-month dexamethasone + DHEA. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were assessed before and after each treatment regimen by examining: 1) fasting and oral glucose tolerance test glucose and insulin levels, 2) hypoglycemic response to intravenous insulin, and 3) erythrocyte insulin receptor binding. With dexamethasone alone, DHEAS, testosterone, and their ratio were reduced with a concomitant increase (30%) in oral glucose tolerance test insulin levels and a decrease (33%) in erythrocyte insulin binding. With DHEA + dexamethasone, the ratio of DHEAS/testosterone increased 16-fold along with a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity, as determined by a more than 30% reduction in fasting and oral glucose tolerance test insulin levels, a threefold stimulation of the rate of glucose disappearance with intravenous insulin, and a 30% increase in insulin binding. DHEA improved insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting and oral glucose tolerance test glucose levels and ameliorated the diabetic state. The ratio of DHEAS/testosterone is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and that DHEA therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of certain forms of insulin resistance."
2007,17018772,Expression of steroidogenic enzymes and synthesis of sex steroid hormones from DHEA in skeletal muscle of rats.,"The functional importance of sex steroid hormones (testosterone and estrogens), derived from extragonadal tissues, has recently gained significant appreciation. Circulating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is peripherally taken up and converted to testosterone by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17beta-HSD, and testosterone in turn is irreversibly converted to estrogens by aromatase cytochrome P-450 (P450arom). Although sex steroid hormones have been implicated in skeletal muscle regulation and adaptation, it is unclear whether skeletal muscles have a local steroidogenic enzymatic machinery capable of metabolizing circulating DHEA. Thus, here, we investigate whether the three key steroidogenic enzymes (3beta-HSD, 17beta-HSD, and P450arom) are present in the skeletal muscle and are capable of generating sex steroid hormones. Consistent with our hypothesis, the present study demonstrates mRNA and protein expression of these enzymes in the skeletal muscle cells of rats both in vivo and in culture (in vitro). Importantly, we also show an intracellular formation of testosterone and estradiol from DHEA or testosterone in cultured muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are novel and important in that they provide the first evidence showing that skeletal muscles are capable of locally synthesizing sex steroid hormones from circulating DHEA or testosterone."
2019,30583414,Aggregation behavior of semolina gluten during dough production and fresh pasta cooking upon kansui treatment.,"Sodium salt reduction in cereal products has been one of the top health trends. During pasta-making, kansui (an alkaline salt with reduced sodium) was added at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (total flour weight basis) to modify semolina gluten aggregation reactions in dough production and pasta cooking. Adding 1.0% kansui enhanced pasta dough elasticity and strength, but cooking quality was changed barely. These consequences may be attributed to more polymeric glutenin incorporated in the network through thiol (SH)/disulfide (SS) exchange or other non-redox reactions/interactions by introducing kansui, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, FTIR, and HPLC results. The protein cross-linking induced by kansui (1.0%) improved the texture properties of pasta without compromising the cooking and coloration characteristics. Considering the process convenience and food safety of reducing sodium chloride with natural alkaline salt reagent in industrial pasta production, this could be a potential approach for sodium reduction."
2008,18349113,Testosterone and DHEA activate the glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.,"Circulating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is converted to testosterone or estrogen in the target tissues. Recently, we demonstrated that skeletal muscles are capable of locally synthesizing circulating DHEA to testosterone and estrogen. Furthermore, testosterone is converted to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5alpha-reductase and exerts biophysiological actions through binding to androgen receptors. However, it remains unclear whether skeletal muscle can synthesize DHT from testosterone and/or DHEA and whether these hormones affect glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscles. We hypothesized that locally synthesized DHT from testosterone and/or DHEA activates glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4)-regulating pathway in skeletal muscles. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether DHT is synthesized from testosterone and/or DHEA in cultured skeletal muscle cells and whether these hormones affect the GLUT-4-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscles. In the present study, the expression of 5alpha-reductase mRNA was detected in rat cultured skeletal muscle cells, and the addition of testosterone or DHEA increased intramuscular DHT concentrations. Addition of testosterone or DHEA increased GLUT-4 protein expression and its translocation. Furthermore, Akt and protein kinase C-zeta/lambda (PKC-zeta/lambda) phosphorylations, which are critical in GLUT-4-regulated signaling pathways, were enhanced by testosterone or DHEA addition. Testosterone- and DHEA-induced increases in both GLUT-4 expression and Akt and PKC-zeta/lambda phosphorylations were blocked by a DHT inhibitor. Finally, the activities of phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, main glycolytic enzymes, were enhanced by testosterone or DHEA addition. These findings suggest that skeletal muscle is capable of synthesizing DHT from testosterone, and that DHT activates the glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscle cells."
2006,16927525,In vitro immunoreactivity towards lectin-rich or viscotoxin-rich mistletoe (Viscum album L.) extracts Iscador applied to healthy individuals.,"The aim of the study was to investigate how exposure to mistletoe extracts in vivo may influence cellular immune reactions by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). 47 healthy individuals were exposed for twelve weeks either to Iscador Quercus special (IQ; rich in mistletoe lectin [ML]) (n = 16), to Iscador Pinus (IP; poor in ML but rich in viscotoxin) (n = 15), or to placebo (physiological saline) (n = 16). PBMC were isolated before exposure, during exposure in week 4, 8 and 12, as well as 13 weeks after last exposure (week 25) and incubated for 7 days with IQ or IP. Proliferative response and cytokine release were determined (type 1 cytokines: interferon [IFN]-gamma, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-gamma, type 2 cytokines: interleukin [IL]-5, IL-13, macrophage/ monocyte-cytokines: IL-1, TNFalpha). IP- and IQ incubation of PBMC from non-exposed individuals lead to a significant increase of proliferation and production of all cytokines. There was a significant increase of IQ-induced TNFalpha (but not IL-1) production by PBMC in week 25 in individuals receiv-type 2-cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 significantly decreased during the observation period (p < 0.05 compared to placebo in week 8). These data indicate that IP seems to contain an antigen, which decreases type 2 reactivity. Furthermore, a component present preferentially in IQ seems to activate the production of the monocyte/ macrophage-related cytokine TNFalpha by PBMC. Intriguingly, also in individuals receiving placebo injections immunological alterations were detected during the observation period."
,25741817,Reduction of Platelet Aggregation From Ingestion of Oleic and Linoleic Acids Found in Vitis vinifera and Arachis hypogaea Oils.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the consumption of seed oils from Vitis vinifera and Arachis hypogaea in platelet aggregation. The initial hypothesis suggested that subjects who have consumed these seed oils undergo modified platelet aggregation. This study was performed using a pre-post test design, with a control group, and double blind. The effects of the consumption of grape seed and peanut oils were measured for platelet aggregation in clinical and laboratory tests in 30 healthy subjects. In addition to this group, a control group of 4 health subjects received no treatment with oils, just 500 mg oral administration acetylsalicylic acid for 7 days. Platelet aggregation was assessed by the Born turbidimetric method, using 3 different concentrations of adenosine diphosphate as agonists (2, 54; 1, 17; and 0, 58 μM). The study subjects had very similar results; both oils were shown to have a significant reduction in platelet aggregation. Grape seed oil showed a decrease of 8.4 ± 1% in aggregation, compared with peanut oil, which decreased aggregation by 10.4 ± 1%. The control group, taking 500 mg OD aspirin for 7 days, showed a significant decrease in platelet aggregation, similar to that of oil ingestion. Each of the oils was analyzed for fatty acids, to determine which particular acids were presents in greater levels, which could explain the reduction in platelet aggregation. The oil found to be most abundant in grape seeds was linoleic acid (omega-6), and in peanuts, it was oleic acid (omega-9). However, in fact, both acids reduced platelet aggregation. Consumption of plant oils from grape seeds and peanuts had a lowering effect on platelet aggregation, in addition to containing a high content of unsaturated fatty acids. However, omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids were not specifically responsible for the reductions mentioned above."
2012,21906765,Acaricidal activity of aqueous extract and synthesized silver nanoparticles from Manilkara zapota against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.,"Traditional parasite control is primarily based on the use of chemical acaricides, which unfortunately have many negative side effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of plant synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Manilkara zapota to control Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction. The UV-vis spectrum of the aqueous medium containing silver nanostructures showed a peak at 421 nm corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance band of AgNPs. SEM supports the biosynthesis and characterization of AgNPs with spherical and oval in shape and size of 70-140 nm. Acaricidal activity of aqueous leaf extract of M. zapota and synthesized AgNPs were carried out against R. (B.) microplus and the results showed the LC(50) values of 16.72 and 3.44 mg/L; r(2)=0.856 and 0.783), respectively."
2009,20169916,The effect of chemically and hydrothermally treated rapeseed on the performance and thyroid parameters of layers.,"A feeding trial with brown laying hens was carried out in order to examine the effects of chemical and hydrothermal treatment of rapeseeds on the performance and thyroid parameters of birds during a long-term experiment. Untreated and treated rapeseeds were included in layer diets at a level of 7.5, 15.0, 22.5 and 30.0%, and the results obtained were compared with a control group fed a diet containing no rapeseed. Rapeseed treatment involved a combination of chemical and hydrothermal processing with subsequent expansion and drying. This treatment decreased sinapine content, from 6152 mg rapeseed/kg to less than 50 mg/kg, and glucosinolate concentration, from 13.8 mmol per kg to 1.4 mmol per kg (basis - 91% dry matter). The inclusion of 22.5% and 30.0% of both untreated and treated rapeseeds significantly impaired egg-laying rate and feed conversion. Egg weight was significantly affected by rapeseed feeding, with a significant decline at the 30.0% vs. the 7.5% rapeseed level. Rapeseed inclusion in the diet had a negative influence on weight gain. An increase in the dietary levels of untreated rapeseeds caused a greater decrease in egg mass, hen weight and feed conversion ratio, compared with the respective levels of treated rapeseeds. Untreated rapeseeds at the lowest level of 7.5% in the diet caused an increase in thyroid weight, epithelial cell height and changes in other histomorphometric thyroid parameters, as well as a decrease in the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones. Treated rapeseeds at a dietary level of 22.5% evoked a dose response, which shows that the chemical and hydrothermal treatment of rapeseed considerably reduced the anti-thyroid effects."

Ketoconazole 20 mg/mL, metolazone 1 mg/mL, metronidazole 50 mg/mL, procainamide hydrochloride 50 mg/ mL, and spironolactone 25 mg/mL were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), and cherry syrup and placed in 120-mL polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The sources of the drugs were powder, capsules, and tablets. Six bottles were prepared per liquid; three were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. A sample was removed from each bottle immediately after preparation and at intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. At least 93% of the initial drug concentration was retained in all the oral liquids for up to 60 days. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of the liquids, or in the pH. Ketoconazole 20 mg/mL, metolazone 1 mg/mL, metronidazole 50 mg/mL, procainamide hydrochloride 50 mg/ mL, and spironolactone 25 mg/mL were stable for up to 60 days at 5 and 25 degrees C in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.

2001,11301044,Influence of culture system and medium enrichment on sulfotransferase and sulfatase expression in male rat hepatocyte cultures.,"The expression of sulfotransferase and steroid sulfatase was studied in rat liver using the most promising culture models of hepatocytes, including monolayer culture with a pyruvate (30 mM) enriched medium, co-culture with rat epithelial cells from primitive biliary origin and collagengel sandwich culture. In the latter, addition of dexamethasone (1 microM) to the medium was examined. Phenol sulfotransferase enzymes (SULT1) were studied by measuring activities towards 4-methylphenol and estradiol, hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (SULT2A) activity was determined towards dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Microsomal steroid sulfatase activity was measured towards estrone sulfate. Western blot analysis was carried out using polyclonal antibodies raised against rat phenol sulfotransferase SULT1A1 (ASTIV), estrogen sulfotransferase SULT1E1 (EST) and hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (HST). SULT2A activity towards DHEA was maintained at a high level during the whole culture time. In the co-culture it even reached the level of freshly isolated cells. Addition of pyruvate had no positive effect on the activity measured in monolayer cultures. High SULT1A1 activity towards 4-methylphenol was found in the co-culture system. In the monolayer culture, the activity initially decreased with 35% but was then kept at a constant level, while in the sandwich culture low activities were measured. For dexamethasone, an inducing effect on the various SULT activities could not be detected. Independently of the culture model used, the SULT1E1 activity towards estradiol decreased to 20% and 5% of the initial activity after four and seven days of culture, respectively. Microsomal steroid sulfatase activity was best maintained in collagengel sandwich cultures. During the first four days in culture it retained 73% of the initial activity, afterwards it decreased to 40% of the activity found in freshly isolated hepatocytes, irrespective of the culture conditions. High expectations exist for collagengel sandwich cultures, however, in our study the results were rather disappointing. Monolayer is a suitable culture model for short-term purposes. For long-term in vitro biotransformation studies, co-culture is preferred but is rather complex."
2017,28193431,"A comparative study of diploid versus triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The effects of rearing temperatures (5, 10 and 15°C) on raw material characteristics and storage quality.","Several major market operators argue that the current level of knowledge about quality is too scant to justify a switch to a large-scale production of triploid salmon. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to elucidate how rearing conditions (5, 10 and 15°C) affect the flesh quality of triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L., 1.6±0.3kg). As a reference, diploid salmon kept under equal conditions and with equal genetics were used. The main design discriminant was the holding temperature; increased temperature gave increased blood lactate, rigor index (Ir), drip loss (DL), content of astaxanthin and intensity of redness, but reduced muscle pH, cathepsin activity and fillet lightness. Salmon kept at 10°C grew the fastest. It is concluded that ploidy gave less variation than temperature. Triploids were characterized by lower blood haematocrit (Hct) and Ir, higher DL and collagenase activity, and on average, paler and less yellowish fillets."
2016,27834815,Role of Metabolic Genes in Blood Aluminum Concentrations of Jamaican Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder.,Aluminum is a neurotoxic metal with known health effects in animals and humans. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes and enzymes play a major role in detoxification of several heavy metals. Besides a direct relationship with oxidative stress; aluminum decreases GST enzyme activities. Using data from 116 Jamaican children; age 2-8 years; with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 116 sex- and age-matched typically developing (TD) children; we investigated the association of polymorphisms in three GST genes (GSTP1; GSTM1; and GSTT1) with mean blood aluminum concentrations in children with and without ASD. Using log-transformed blood aluminum concentration as the dependent variable in a linear regression model; we assessed the additive and interactive effects of ASD status and polymorphisms in the three aforementioned GST genes in relation to blood aluminum concentrations. Although none of the additive effects were statistically significant (all p > 0.16); we observed a marginally significant interaction between GSTP1 Ile105Val (rs1695) and ASD status (p = 0.07); even after controlling for parental education level and consumption of avocado; root vegetables; and tuna (canned fish). Our findings indicate a significantly lower (p < 0.03) adjusted geometric mean blood aluminum concentration for TD children who had the Val/Val genotype (14.57 µg/L); compared with those with Ile/Ile or Ile/Val genotypes who had an adjusted geometric mean of 23.75 µg/L. However; this difference was not statistically significant among the ASD cases (p = 0.76). Our findings indicate that ASD status may be a potential effect modifier when assessing the association between GSTP1 rs1695 and blood aluminum concentrations among Jamaican children. These findings require replication in other populations.
2014,24597148,Role of Triticum aestivum aqueous extract in glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in rats.,"Administration of aqueous extract of T. aestivum (200 and 400 mg/kg/day, po, for 30 days) and risedronate (20 microg/kg, sc, five times a week for 30 days) following methyl prednisolone sodium succinate (10 mg/kg, sc, thrice a week for 4 weeks) induced osteoporosis in Wistar rats showed an increase in the serum levels of bone mineral content markers, decrease in the serum and urinary levels of bone resorption markers. An incline in strength of femur and tibia was seen particularly with 400 mg/kg of T. aestivum. Maintenance of calcium homeostasis, formation of collagen and scavenging of free radicals can plausibly be the mode of action of aqueous extract of T. aestivum thereby combating osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoids."
2005,15627474,Carnosol inhibits the invasion of B16/F10 mouse melanoma cells by suppressing metalloproteinase-9 through down-regulating nuclear factor-kappa B and c-Jun.,"Carnosol, a constant constituent of Rosmarinus officinalis extracts, is a phenolic diterpene shown to have antioxidant and anticarcinogen properties. In our studies, carnosol inhibited the invasion of highly metastatic mouse melanoma B16/F10 cells in vitro. First, the antimetastatic potentials of carnosol were examined by soft agar colony formation assay. Second, carnosol dose-dependently inhibited B16/F10 cell migration and invasion by in vitro transwell assay. Third, the decreasing activity of metalloproteinase was observed by zymographic assay. The result revealed that the treatment of carnosol could diminish the activity of MMP-9 more than MMP-2. Next, we analyzed the amounts of MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins in the cells. The data indicated MMP-9 protein was also suppressed by carnosol in the same manner. In accordance with the above data, the results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a reduced level of MMP-9 mRNA. Furthermore, carnosol significantly inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, AKT, p38, JNK and inhibition of activation of transcription factors NFkappa-B and c-Jun. These results lead us to conclude that carnosol could restrict the invasive ability of B16/F10 mouse melanoma cells by reducing MMP-9 expression and activity through suppressing (ERK) 1/2, AKT, p38, and JNK signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding activity. Taken together, these results indicate that carnosol targets MMP-mediated cellular events in cancer cells and provides a new mechanism for its anticancer activity."
2011,22024968,Potential pharmacokinetic interactions between antiretrovirals and medicinal plants used as complementary and African traditional medicines.,"The use of traditional/complementary/alternate medicines (TCAMs) in HIV/AIDS patients who reside in Southern Africa is quite common. Those who use TCAMs in addition to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment may be at risk of experiencing clinically significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, particularly between the TCAMs and the protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Mechanisms of PK interactions include alterations to the normal functioning of drug efflux transporters, such as P-gp and/or CYP isoenzymes, such a CYP3A4 that mediate the absorption and elimination of drugs in the small intestine and liver. Specific mechanisms include inhibition and activation of these proteins and induction via the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Several clinical studies and case reports involving ARV-herb PK interactions have been reported. St John's Wort, Garlic and Cat's Claw exhibited potentially significant interactions, each with a PI or NNRTI. The potential for these herbs to induce PK interactions with drugs was first identified in reports of in vitro studies. Other in vitro studies have shown that several African traditional medicinal (ATM) plants and extracts may also demonstrate PK interactions with ARVs, through effects on CYP3A4, P-gp and PXR. The most complex effects were exhibited by Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Sutherlandia frutescens, Cyphostemma hildebrandtii, Acacia nilotica, Agauria salicifolia and Elaeodendron buchananii. Despite a high incidence of HIV/AIDs in the African region, only one clinical study, between efavirenz and Hypoxis hemerocallidea has been conducted. However, several issues/concerns still remain to be addressed and thus more studies on ATMs are warranted in order for more meaningful data to be generated and the true potential for such interactions to be determined."
2015,26632178,Resveratrol Ameliorates Clonidine-Induced Endothelium-Dependent Relaxation Involving Akt and Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Regulation in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.,"Diabetic vascular complication is one of the manifestations of endothelial dysfunction. Resveratrol (RV) is considered to be beneficial in protecting endothelial function. However, the exact protective effect and mechanisms involved have not been fully clarified. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and RV in diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. Aortas were dissected and placed in organ chambers, and nitric oxide (NO) production in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and RV was measured. ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly increased in controls by RV pretreatment. Furthermore, RV caused NO-dependent relaxation via the Akt signaling pathway, which was weaker in the aortas of diabetic mice than age-matched controls. To further examine the underlying mechanisms, we measured the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS by Western blotting. RV caused the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in aortas, which was decreased in diabetic mice. However, RV augmented the impaired clonidine-induced relaxation in diabetic mice. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS was increased under stimulation with RV and clonidine only in diabetic mice. Thus, either RV or clonidine causes Akt-dependent NO-mediated relaxation, which is weaker in diabetic mice than controls. However, additional exposure to RV and clonidine has an augmenting effect on the Akt/eNOS signaling pathway under diabetic conditions. RV-induced Akt/eNOS activity may be a common link involved in the clonidine-induced Akt/eNOS activity, so RV and clonidine may have a synergistic effect. "
2014,24720113,[Immune stimulative potency of milk proteins].,"Milk proteins are characterized by the highest immune stimulative potency from among all the proteins present in human diet. Whey proteins and numerous growth factors that regulate insulin secretion, differentiation of intestine epithelium cells, and also tissue restoration, are priceless in stimulation the immune system. Lactoferrin shows the most comprehensive pro-health properties: antioxidative, anticancer, immune stimulative and even chemopreventive. Also peptides and amino acids formed from casein and whey proteins possess immune stimulative activity. The most valuable proteins, i.e. lactoferrin, immune globulins, lactoperoxidase and lisozyme, together with bioactive peptides, are resistant to pepsin and trypsin activity. This is why they maintain their exceptional biological activity within human organism. Properly high consumption of milk proteins conditions correct function of immune system, especially at children and elderly persons."
2000,10907671,Effects of repeated ingestion of grapefruit juice on the single and multiple oral-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam.,"The effects of repeated ingestion of grapefruit juice, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both single and multiple oral doses of alprazolam, a substrate of CYP3A4, were examined. In study 1, eight healthy volunteers ingesting 600 ml/day water or grapefruit juice for 10 days took a single oral 0.8-mg dose of alprazolam on the eighth day. Plasma drug concentrations were monitored up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing together with evaluation of psychomotor function. Grapefruit juice altered neither the plasma concentrations of alprazolam at any time points, any pharmacokinetic parameters, nor the majority of psychomotor function parameters in subjects. In study 2, 11 patients with anxiety disorders receiving alprazolam (0.8-2.4 mg/day) ingested grapefruit juice (600 ml/day) for 7 days. Blood samples were collected before and during grapefruit juice ingestion and 1 week after its discontinuation together with an assessment of clinical status. Grapefruit juice altered neither the steady-state plasma concentration of alprazolam nor the clinical status in patients. The present study shows that grapefruit juice is unlikely to affect pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of alprazolam due to its high bioavailability."
1998,9848501,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor effects on avian osteoclastic acid transport.,"We found that tyrosine kinase pp60(c-src) coisolates with acid-transporting osteoclast membranes and hypothesized that this kinase regulates hydrochloric acid transport. We assayed the membrane acid transport and bone degradation effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in avian osteoclasts. Isoflavone, tyrphostin, and benzoquinonoid inhibitors were compared with inactive analogues to determine nonspecific effects. Acid-secreting membranes, isolated by nitrogen cavitation, were assayed as reconstituted vesicles by using acridine orange to indicate ATP-dependent hydrogen ion transport. The soy isoflavone genistein and the benzoquinonoid antibiotic herbimycin inhibited hydrochloric acid transport with 50% inhibition at approximately 10 and approximately 2 micromol/L, respectively; effects appeared in <2 min and were reversible. In membrane incubated with inhibitors, the herbimycin effect also inhibited Cl- transport by variable amounts, suggesting that this compound affects Cl- channel activity. However, genistein and tyrphostins did not produce chloride dependent effects. After 30 min with ATP, tyrphostin A47 irreversibly inhibited hydrochloric acid transport with 50% inhibition at approximately 10 micromol/L. Tyrphostin A25 and controls, tyrphostin A1 and daidzein (a genistein congener), were inactive despite preincubation. Osteoclastic bone resorption was more sensitive to the inhibitors over 3-5-d assays than was membrane acid transport, except for tyrphostins. Herbimycin and genistein inhibited bone resorption with half maximal effects at 0.5 and 10 micromol/L and complete inhibition at 3 d in 1 and 20 micromol/L, respectively. None of the tyrphostins, including A47, nor daidzein inhibited resorption to >20 micromol/L. We conclude that tyrosine kinase inhibition directly inhibits osteoclast membrane hydrochloric acid transport; differences among inhibitors may reflect chemical reactivity and permeability."
2019,30236666,Enhanced accumulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid in rice bran using anaerobic incubation with various additives.,"An anaerobic incubation for the enzymatic production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in rice bran with the addition of glutamate, hydrolyzed wheat protein (HWP), yeast extract (YE) and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) was investigated. Rice bran was moistened (30% moisture content) with an electrolyzed oxidizing water and anaerobically incubated under nitrogen at 40 °C for 8 h. The incubation activated the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in rice bran and increased the GABA content from 10.7 to 171.5 mg/100 g. The addition of glutamate and protein hydrolysates further amplified the GABA content in the treated rice bran: 974.9, 487.4, and 372.8 mg/100 g, with 2.25% glutamate, 6% HWP, and 8% YE, respectively. Furthermore, addition of PLP (1.48 mg/100 g) as a coenzyme for GAD, together with 2.25% glutamate addition, could raise the GABA accumulation in rice bran to 2242 mg/100 g. Other amino acids in rice bran were changed in their composition by the anaerobic treatment."
2019,31471773,Interactions between clopidogrel and traditional Chinese medicine.,"The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has obtained more and more acceptance all over the world due to its multi-target and multi-level function characteristics. Clopidogrel is a major therapeutic option to reduce atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, recent myocardial infarction, recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease. These patients probably take TCM. Are there any interactions between clopidogrel and TCM? Whether TCM will affect the efficacy of clopidogrel or increase the adverse reactions of bleeding? Clarifying this information will help physicians make better use of TCM. A literature search was carried out using Web of Science, PubMed and the Cochrane Library to analyze the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions of clopidogrel and TCM. Some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel, such as Scutellarin, Danggui, Gegen, Sauchinone and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Whereas others can decrease clopidogrel, for example, Ginkgo and Danshen. Furthermore, some herbs can increase the AUC or Cmax of clopidogrel active metabolite, including Ginkgo and Xuesaitong tablet. And others can decrease the clopidogrel active metabolite, such as Scutellarin, Danshen, Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill and Dengzhan Shengmai capsules. Additionally, Schisandra chinensis, Danggui, Gegen and Fufang Danshen Dripping Pill can decrease the AUC or Cmax of the clopidogrel inactive metabolite, while Curcumin on the contrary. The pharmacodynamics of Panax notoginseng, Notoginsenoside Ft1, Hypericum perforatum, Shexiang baoxin pills, Naoxintong capsule increased the antiplatelet activity compared with clopidogrel alone, while Danshen decreased the platelet inhibition. In adverse reactions, Danggui can enhance the adverse effects of clopidogrel on the bleeding time. With more awareness and understanding on potential drug-herb interactions of clopidogrel and TCM, it may be possible to combine clopidogrel with TCM herbs to yield a better therapeutic outcome."
2014,24636680,[Treatment of adrenal deficiency: To what issues? By which therapeutic means?].,"Quality of life remains altered in the adrenal insufficient patient treated by hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Due to its pharmacokinetics properties, hydrocortisone requires 2 to 3 daily doses - including a morning intake of 2/3 or half of the daily dose respectively - while fludrocortisone requires a once morning daily dose. Titration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone relies on the clinical symptoms of over- or under-replacement together with biochemical indexes such as plasma sodium, potassium and renin. DHEA replacement may improve quality of life and mood and may increase lean body mass and bone mineral density, especially in women with adrenal insufficiency. The new slow release hydrocortisone formulations may help reproduce a more physiological cortisol plasma profile and thus reduce the impact of over-replacement on cardiovascular risk factors and glucose metabolism. Acute adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening complication of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid under-replacement, which may be prevented by educational programs towards the adrenal insufficient patient.

2015,25586000,"Silibinin mitigates zidovudine-induced hepatocellular degenerative changes, oxidative stress and hyperlipidaemia in rats.","Prolonged zidovudine (AZT) treatment in HIV-infected and AIDS patients is shown to induce liver toxicity leading to complications. Therapeutic regimen that could encounter this adverse effect is unavailable and management of toxicity is often symptomatic or is limited to withdrawal of therapy. In the present investigation, we evaluated the alleviating properties of silibinin (SBN), a flavanolignan obtained from Silybum marianum against subacute AZT-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats. AZT treatment (50 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) periorally (p.o.), daily for 45 days) caused highly significant increases in alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, argininosuccinic acid lyase and bilirubin in serum. Oxidative stress is shown by a highly significant increase in lipid peroxidase and total carbonyl content and decrease in catalase and protein thiols in the liver tissue. Hyperlipidaemia is indicated by highly significant increase in total lipids and free fatty acid in serum. Evaluation of liver by haematoxylin and eosin staining shows parenchymal cell enlargement, inflammatory changes and increase in sinusoidal spaces. Simultaneous treatment of SBN (100 mg/kg b.w. p.o., daily for 45 days) significantly protected the liver against hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and hyperlipidaemia induced by AZT, and this alleviating property is attributed to hepatoprotective, membrane-stabilizing, antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of SBN.

2012,22894541,Effect of green tea extracts on oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats.,"A common side effect of oxaliplatin is peripheral neurotoxicity. Oxidative stress to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) may be one of important pathogenic mechanisms. Green tea contains four polyphenol catechins, which are known to be potent antioxidants. The present work is aimed to determine whether green tea extracts have neuroproective or palliative effects on neurotoxicity symptoms induced by oxaliplatin.We conducted behavioral tests including sensory and thermal thresholds, an electrophysiological study, and TUNEL staining to assess neurotoxicity during the experimental period using animal models.A total of 14 adult rats were randomly allocated into two groups. Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg) with or without green tea (300 mg/kg orally once daily) was administered intraperitoneally twice per week for 6 weeks. At 4 and 6 weeks after oxaliplatin administration, sensory threshold values were significantly decreased and at 6 weeks after oxaliplatin administration, thermal threshold values were significantly increased in oxaliplatin-treated rats compared with those in rat treated with oxaliplatin and green tea extracts. The electrophysiological assessment, including sensory nerve conduction and H-reflex-related sensory nerve conduction velocity, revealed no significant changes in the two groups. TUNEL staining showed no significant difference in the number of apoptotic-featured cells between the two experimental groups in the DRG or peripheral nerves, but the number of apoptotic-featured cells in DRG was higher than that in sciatic nerves within each group.Green tea extracts may be a useful adjuvant to alleviate sensory symptoms after oxaliplatin administration, such as allodynia, but did not prevent morphometric or electrophysiological alterations induced by oxaliplatin."

In order to investigate perchlorate contamination in foods in Japan, perchlorate levels in 28 wine samples, 20 seafood samples, 10 polished rice samples, 30 milk (include whole milk, composition modified milk, low fat milk, processed milk, milk drink) samples, 10 powdered milk samples and 10 yogurt samples were measured. Perchlorate was found in all wine, milk, powdered milk and yogurt samples tested. Perchlorate levels ranged from 0.2 ng/g to 103 ng/g in wine samples, from 2 ng/g to 11 ng/g in milk samples, from 3 ng/g to 35 ng/g in powdered milk samples, and from 2 ng/g to 11 ng/g in yogurt samples. Perchlorate levels in the seafood samples were under the LOQ (0.8 ng/g) in 8 samples and ranged from 0.8 ng/g to 72 ng/g in 12 samples. In all polished rice samples, perchlorate level was under the LOQ (1.0 ng/g)."
2019,30273493,Coenzyme Q10 does not improve peripheral insulin sensitivity in statin-treated men and women: the LIFESTAT study.,"Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that is prescribed to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease following high levels of blood cholesterol. There is a possible risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus with statin treatment but the mechanisms behind are unknown. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation has been found to improve glucose homeostasis in various patient populations and may increase muscle glucose transporter type 4 content. Our aim was to investigate if 8 weeks of CoQ10 supplementation can improve glucose homeostasis in simvastatin-treated subjects. Thirty-five men and women in treatment with a minimum of 40 mg of simvastatin daily were randomized to receive either 2 × 200 mg/day of CoQ10 supplementation or placebo for 8 weeks. Glucose homeostasis was investigated with fasting blood samples, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance test. Insulin sensitivity was assessed with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Different indices were calculated from fasting samples and OGTT as secondary measures of insulin sensitivity. A muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle for muscle protein analyzes. There were no changes in body composition, fasting plasma insulin, fasting plasma glucose, or 3-h glucose with intervention, but glycated hemoglobin decreased with time. Glucose homeostasis measured as the area under the curve for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide during OGTT was unchanged after intervention. Insulin secretory capacity was also unaltered after CoQ10 supplementation. Insulin sensitivity was unchanged but hepatic insulin sensitivity increased. No changes in muscle GLUT4 content was observed after intervention. CoQ10 supplementation does not change muscle GLUT4 content, insulin sensitivity, or secretory capacity, but hepatic insulin sensitivity may improve."
2016,27133072,Anticoagulant properties and cytotoxic effect against HCT116 human colon cell line of sulfated glycosaminoglycans isolated from the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) shell.,"Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (SGNL) were extracted for the first time from Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) shell. The monosaccharide composition analysed by GC/MS revealed the presence of galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. The analysis of SGNL with acetate cellulose electrophoresis in Zn-acetate revealed the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS). SGNL were evaluated for their anticoagulant activities using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT) and prothrombine time (PT) tests. After 21h incubation, HCT116 cell proliferation was inhibited (p<0.05) between 39.7 and 54.8% at 1.5-7.5mg/mL of SGNL. SGNL don't show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes and no cytotoxicity against the normal lymphocytes. The antiproliferative efficacy of these lobster glycosaminoglycans were probably related with the higher sulfate content. SGNL demonstrated promising antiproliferative and anticoagulant potential, which may be used as a novel, effective and promising antithrombotic agent. "
2003,12851037,Diterpene quinone tanshinone IIA selectively inhibits mouse and human cytochrome p4501A2.,"1. Tanshinone IIA is the main active diterpene quinone in the herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza. In untreated mouse liver microsomes, tanshinone IIA selectively inhibited 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) and 7-methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD) activities without affecting the oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene, tolbutamide, N-nitrosodimethylamine and nifedipine. Tanshinone IIA was a competitive inhibitor of MROD activity with a K(i) of 7.2 +/- 0.7 nM. 2. In 3-methylcholanthrene-treated mouse liver microsomes, tanshinone IIA and two minor tanshinones, tanshinone I and cryptotanshinone, inhibited liver microsomal MROD activity without affecting EROD and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation activities at the concentrations up to 1 microM. Tanshinone IIA induced a type I binding spectrum with a spectral dissociation constant K(s) of 2.3 +/-0.8 microM without cooperativity. 3. In human liver microsomes, tanshinone IIA decreased EROD and MROD activities without affecting the oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene, tolbutamide, chlorzoxazone and nifedipine. 4. In Escherichia coli membranes expressing bicistronic human CYP1A enzymes, tanshinone IIA inhibited EROD activity of CYP1A1 with an IC(50) 48 times higher than that for CYP1A2. Tanshinone I and cryptotanshinone had the same IC(50) ratio (1A1/1A2) of 4. 5. The results indicate that tanshinone represents a new group of CYP1A inhibitors, and tanshinone IIA had the highest selectivity in inhibition of CYP1A2."
2014,24854283,In vitro glucuronidation of five rhubarb anthraquinones by intestinal and liver microsomes from humans and rats.,"Anthraquinones naturally distribute in many plants including rhubarb and have widespread applications throughout industry and medicine. Recent studies provided new insights in potential applications of these traditional laxative constituents. Glucuronidation was the main metabolic pathway of rhubarb anthraquinones in vivo. This study examined the activity and regioselectivity of glucuronidation of rhubarb anthraquinones (aloe-emodin, emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, rhein) in liver and intestinal microsomes from rats and humans, by comparing with the core structure danthron. All anthraquinones formed mono-glucuronides and, except for rhein, the conjugation sites of the main metabolites were unambiguously identified. Two minor glucuronides of emodin were first reported together with the dominant emodin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide. The substitution on the anthraquinone ring was crucial to the activity and regioselectivity of glucuronidation. In general, the activity was decreased greatly with a β-COOH (rhein), while enhanced dramatically with a β-OH (emodin). Glucuronidation showed an absolute preference towards β-OH, followed by α-OH and β-alcoholic OH. The glucuronidation activity and regioselectivity also varied slightly with organs and species. All glucuronides of aloe-emodin, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion were formed by multiple human UGT isoforms with 1A9 being the most prominent in most cases. The UGT2B subfamily (2B7 and 2B15) only showed high activity towards a β-OH. In conclusion, the substitution at the anthraquinone ring was crucial to the rate and preference of glucuronidation. The high glucuronidation activity of UGT1A9 towards anthraquinones highlighted potential drug interactions."

2015,25553436,Curcumin as an adjuvant to breast cancer treatment.,"Cancer is the second largest leading cause of death worldwide and breast cancer is the most prevailing cause of mortality among all cases of malignant neoplastic disease in adult females. The incidence rate of breast malignant neoplastic disease is predominantly higher in Western women, when compared to women in Asian nations. The definitive reason for this conflict is even unknown, but dietary factors have been conceived to account for approximately 30% of cancers in Western nations. It has been hypothesized that ethnicity, including use of a variety of spices in the food would be a major reason. Among all spices, turmeric (Curcuma longa) has been proven for its better anticancer potential. In this review different molecular mechanisms including cell cycle arrest; G0/G1 and/or G2/M phase cell cycle arrest by up-regulating Cdk inhibitor, p21/WAF/CIPI and p53, inhibition of transcriptional factors; NFκB, AP-1, TNFα, IL, STAT-3, and PPAR-γ, downstream gene regulation; c-myc, Bcl-2, COX-2, NOS, Cyclin D1, TNFα, interleukins and MMP-9, growth factors; bFGF, EGF, GCSF, IL-8, PDGF, TGFα, TNF, VEGF and cell adhesion molecules; fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen which are involved in angiogenesis and metastasis, alsothe effectiveness of curcumin, when given in combination with chemotherapeutics like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitomycin etc. in treating breast cancer have been reviewed.

2014,25212747,Coffee inhibits adipocyte differentiation via inactivation of PPARγ.,"Recent epidemiological studies showed that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, presumably due to suppression of excess fat accumulation in adipocytes. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of coffee on adipocyte differentiation has not been well documented. To elucidate the mechanism, we investigated the effect of coffee on the differentiation of mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. Coffee reduced the accumulation of lipids during adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At 5% coffee, the accumulation of lipids decreased to half that of the control. Coffee also inhibited the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a transcription factor controlling the differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, coffee reduced the expression of other differentiation marker genes, aP2, adiponectin, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), during adipocyte differentiation. Major bioactive constituents in coffee extracts, such as caffeine, trigonelline, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, showed no effect on PPARγ gene expression. The inhibitory activity was produced by the roasting of the coffee beans."
2018,29879629,Eucalyptus microcorys leaf extract derived HPLC-fraction reduces the viability of MIA PaCa-2 cells by inducing apoptosis and arresting cell cycle.,"New therapeutic strategies such as the development of novel drugs and combinatorial therapies with existing chemotherapeutic agents are urgently needed to improve the clinical prognosis of pancreatic cancer. We have previously reported the antiproliferative properties of aqueous crude Eucalyptus microcorys extract against pancreatic cancer cell lines. In this study, bioassay-guided fractionation of the aqueous crude E. microcorys extract using RP-HPLC and subsequent assessment of the resultant fractions (F1-F5) for their antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cell lines were performed. The molecular mechanisms associated with the cytotoxicity was characterised by studying the effects of the most potent fraction-1 (F1) on apoptosis and cell cycle profiles as well as its phytochemical constituents by LC-ESI/MS/MS. F1 displayed significantly greater antioxidant activity in three different assays (p < 0.05). Moreover, F1 exhibited significantly greater antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 93.11 ± 3.43 μg/mL) against MIA PaCa-2 cells compared to the other four fractions (p < 0.05). F1 induced apoptosis by regulating key apoptotic proteins- Bcl-2, Bak, Bax, cleaved PARP, procaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 in MIA PaCa-2 cells, suggesting the involvement of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and arrested cells at G2/M phase. A combination of gemcitabine and F1 exerted a greater effect on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest than F1 or gemcitabine alone (p < 0.05). LC-ESI/MS/MS revealed the tentative identities of phytochemicals present in F1 and their similarities with the phenolic compounds previously reported in Eucalyptus with antipancreatic cancer activity. Our study shows that the polyphenol and antioxidant-rich fraction of E. microcorys extract is a promising candidate for developing mono or combination therapies against pancreatic cancer."
2016,27852303,"The effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a randomized controlled trial.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The use of Nigella sativa, a potent herbal medicine, continues to increase worldwide as an alternative treatment of several chronic diseases including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured.Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group. None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group. In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05).Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients. Considering observed health- promoting effect of this medicinal plant in ameliorating the disease severity, it can be regarded as a useful therapeutic approach in management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Iranian registry of clinical trials (registration number IRCT2015021719082N4 - Registered March-15-2015)."
2007,18057723,Ginkgolide C inhibits platelet aggregation in cAMP- and cGMP-dependent manner by activating MMP-9.,"In this report, we investigated the effect of ginkgolide C (GC) from Ginkgo biloba leaves in collagen (10 mug/ml)-stimulated platelet aggregation. It has been known that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is released from human platelets, and that it significantly inhibited platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen. Zymographic analysis confirmed that pro-MMP-9 (92-kDa) was activated by GC to form an activated MMP-9 (86-kDa) on gelatinolytic activities. And then, GC dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, and thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) formation in collagen-stimulated platelets. In addition, GC significantly increased the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which have an anti-platelet function in both resting and collagen-stimulated platelets. Therefore, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of GC on platelet aggregation might be involved into the following pathways. GC may increase intracellular cAMP and cGMP production and MMP-9 activity, inhibit intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and TXA(2) production, thereby leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation. These results strongly indicate that GC is a potent inhibitor of collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. It may be a suitable tool for a negative regulator during platelet activation."
2017,28643219,Triple Antithrombotic Therapy in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing PCI: a Fading Role.,"Triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT), consisting of aspirin, a P2Y12 receptor antagonist and oral anticoagulant (OAC) medication has been considered as an 'unavoidable' strategy for a 1-12 months for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients post acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary angioplasty with stenting. However, TAT has rather poorly been adopted in real life practice, mainly because of an accompanying increased bleeding potential and lack of definitive results of randomized clinical trials. Several registries, meta-analyses and small randomized trials have so far provided the base of guidelines recommendations. Furthermore, in the recently published Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects with Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PIONEER AF-PCI) trial involving 2124 patients, the primary safety endpoint of clinically significant bleeding was significantly reduced in the rivaroxaban low dose (15 mg daily) plus single P2Y12 receptor antagonist arm compared to TAT, with no difference in the secondary efficacy endpoint. Despite several limitations of the PIONEER AF-PCI trial, it appears that among patients who omit aspirin, there may be equivalent ischemic protection with dual therapy and no disadvantage for additional risk of thrombotic events."
1998,9666820,Inducible nitric oxide synthase is expressed in granuloma pyogenicum.,"It is known that granuloma pyogenicum (GP) grows rapidly but cherry angioma (CA) does not, although they show the same histological features of hyperplasia of the capillary vessels. Although some cytokines have been thought to be angiogenic factors, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase-dependent effector mechanism is reported to be involved in macrophage-derived angiogenesis in humans. Under the hypothesis that this mechanism is also involved in the more rapid growth of GP, we examined the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in GP as compared with that in CA. The expression of iNOS mRNA was detected in GP, but not in CA, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In situ hybridization (ISH) demonstrated iNOS mRNA expression in endothelial cells and to a lesser extent round cells and spindle cells in the myxomatous stroma in GP. Immunohistochemical study showed that iNOS protein was expressed in endothelial cells, infiltrating round cells and spindle cells in the stroma in GP. These results suggested that a NOS-dependent mechanism may be involved in angiogenesis and the rapid growth of GP."
2010,19825221,"Red wine metabolites modulate NF-kappaB, activator protein-1 and cAMP response element-binding proteins in human endothelial cells.","We have studied the effect of human serum, collected after red wine consumption (RWS), on TNF-alpha-dependent activation of transcription factors (NF-kappaB, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element-binding proteins) and on the expression of selected genes involved in cell adhesion or fibrinolysis processes in human primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). Our data indicate that RWS containing RW metabolites, isolated after 40 min from an acute consume of wine (5 ml/kg body weight), induces nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in the absence of any further stimulus. On the other hand, TNF-alpha treatment in the presence of RWS is associated with a delay in transcription factor activation and to a negative modulation on the expression of specific genes. Moreover, RWS stimulates c-jun binding to the tissue-type plasminogen activator cAMP responsive element consensus site modulating the expression of the specific gene downstream. These results confirm that RW metabolites affect the activity of different transcription factors playing an important preconditioning role in the modulation of the inflammatory pathway in endothelial cells. This is the first report on the effects of a complex food matrix, on the molecular mechanisms associated with inflammatory response in HUVEC cultured in condition that reproduces the physiological environment occurring in vivo."

Hypertension was induced in rats by L-NAME.Repeated treatment with EGb761 produced progressive reductions in the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Also, EGb761 increased the progressive reductions in blood pressure induced by losartan. Hypertension-induced marked elevation of renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels and reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) level were inhibited by EGb761. In addition, hypertension-induced increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) levels in renal tissues were inhibited by EGb761. Also, treatment with EGb761 inhibited hypertension-induced decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and increase in the protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1B in the kidney tissues. EGb761 enhanced losartan effects on renal tissues oxidative stress, nitrite, and inflammatory markers levels and on protein expressions of eNOS, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1B. effects.These results indicate that EGb761 has the ability to protect against hypertension-induced renal injury."

""garlic"", one of the most interesting medicinal plants, has been suggested to contain compounds that could be beneficial in numerous pathological situations including cancer. In this work, we aimed to assess the immunomodulatory effect of A.S. preparation on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals.Nontoxic doses of A.S. were identified using MTT assay. Effects on CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation were studied using flow cytometry. The effect of A.S. on cytokine gene expression was studied using qRT-PCR. Finally, qualitative analysis of A.S. was performed by HPLC approach. Data were analyzed statistically by one-way ANOVA test.The nontoxic doses of A.S. preparation did not affect neither spontaneous nor TCR-mediated CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation. Interestingly, A.S. exhibited a statistically significant regulation of IL-17 gene expression, a cytokine involved in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In contrast, the expression of IL-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was unaffected. Qualitative analysis of A.S. ethanol preparation indicated the presence of three polyphenol bioactive compounds, which are catechin, vanillic acid and ferulic acid.The specific inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17 without affecting cell proliferation in human PBMCs by the Allium sativum L. preparation suggests a potential valuable effect of the compounds present in this plant for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer, where IL-17 is highly expressed.

,16309225,"Modes of action of alpha-hederin and thymoquinone, active constituents of Nigella sativa, against HEp-2 cancer cells.","Our previous studies on active constituents of Nigella sativa have indicated that cell death induced by thymoquinone and alpha-hederin was dose- and time-dependent, in a range of four cancer cell lines. Both compounds elicited necrosis and apoptosis with a higher incidence of the latter induced by thymoquinone. As HEp-2 human laryngeal carcinoma cells were the most susceptible, we sought to better understand the mechanisms involved by using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a selective inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, to determine the importance of GSH in the apoptosis elicited, using cisplatin as internal standard. BSO significantly enhanced alpha-hederin- and cisplatin- mediated toxicity as assessed by the MIT assay, without changes in apoptosis or necrosis levels. Although the MTI assay did not indicate BSO potentiation of thymoquinone, apoptosis levels were significantly enhanced following this combination, without changes in necrosis. Thymoquinone and cisplatin significantly decreased GSH levels in a dose-dependent manner, with BSO pre-treatment synergistically depleting GSH levels in only thymoquinone- treated cells. As the caspase 3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-fmk significantly decreased thymoquinone- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, GSH depletion and caspase 3-activation mediate thymoquinone-induced apoptosis, in this cell line."
1997,9313945,Development of basal and induced testosterone hydroxylase activity in the chicken embryo in ovo.,"1. The sensitivity of the developing embryo to xenobiotics is highly dependent on the expression of metabolizing enzymes including cytochromes P450 (CYP). In the present study, therefore, the ontogeny of the CYP-dependent system in the chick was investigated with testosterone hydroxylase activity as a marker of CYP expression. 2. Chicken embryo livers were assayed for basal and phenobarbitone (PB)-induced regio- and stereo-selective testosterone hydroxylase activity, from the first appearance of the liver as a discrete organ at 5 days of incubation through day 10 posthatching. In addition, whole embryo preparations were assayed at 3 and 4 days of incubation. 3. Whereas testosterone 16 beta-hydroxylase and androst-4-ene-3, 17-dione-linked activities were expressed during all stages of embryonic development, testosterone 6 alpha-, 6 beta-, 7 alpha- and 16 alpha-hydroxylase activities were observed only in basal embryos from 8 days of incubation. Furthermore, testosterone 2 alpha- and 2 beta-hydroxylase activities were detected exclusively from 10 days of incubation onward. All activities increased steadily throughout development as did the responsiveness of the embryonic liver to PB induction. 4. A typical pattern of development with a higher activity from 10 to 14 days of incubation (testosterone 16 alpha-, 7 alpha-, 6 alpha- and 2 beta-hydroxylase activities; up to 4.1 +/- 0.3 pmol mg-1 protein min-1 at 13 days of incubation for testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase) or shifted to 14 to 18 days of incubation (testosterone 6 beta-, 2 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxylase activities: up to 56.6 +/- 1.4 pmol mg-1 protein min-1 at 16 days of incubation for testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase) was observed. There was a tendency towards an increased activity for all activities around hatching, specifically from 19 days of incubation to 4 days posthatching (up to 1,759.3 +/- 179.4 pmol mg-1 protein min-1 at 1 day posthatching for androst-4-ene-3,17-dione-linked activity). 5. The highest level of PB-induced enzyme activity was observed for testosterone 2 alpha-hydroxylase activity (95.14 +/- 7.35 and 660.19 +/- 45.27 pmol mg-1 protein min-1) at 12 days of incubation and day 3 posthatching, respectively. Except for testosterone 2 alpha- and 2 beta-hydroxylase activities at 3 to 4 days of incubation, all metabolites were detectable during the first period of organogenesis in the presence of PB. 6. The use of highly specific substrates, studies on the immunoinhibition of metabolism by polyclonal antibodies raised against highly purified rat CYPs, and the use of selective inhibitors seemed to reveal a wide pleiotropic response with the possible presence in liver of PB-treated chickens of CYP1A together with CYP2HI/H2, CYP2E and CYP3A."

Nanoparticles were tested for anticancer (HeLa cervical cancer cells), antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), urease inhibition (jack-bean urease), anti-inflammatory (carrageenan-induced paw edema), and antinociceptive (abdominal constriction response) activities.The nanoparticles were mostly spherical with an average particle size between 7 and 30 nm (Au-NPs) and 5-30 nm (Ag-NPs). Au/Ag-NPs maintained their colloidal stability and nanoscale characteristics against variations in physicochemical factors. Au/Ag-NPs have potent anticancer potential (IC50 = 2.14 ± 0.15 μg/mL and 3.45 ± 0.23 μg/mL). Au/Ag-NPs selectively suppressed the growth of S. aureus (10.5 ± 0.6 mm, 19.7 ± 0.4 mm), E. coli (10 ± 0.4 mm, 14.4 ± 0.7 mm), and P. aeruginosa (8.2 ± 0.3 mm, 13.1 ± 0.2 mm), as well as showed preferential inhibition against jack-bean urease (19.2 ± 0.86%, 21.5 ± 1.17%). At doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, Au-NPs significantly ameliorated the increase in paw edema during the 1st h (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) and 2-5 h (P < 0.001) of carrageenan-induced inflammation compared to the 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of P. domestica gum (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). At similar doses, Au-NPs also significantly abolished (P < 0.01) the tonic visceral, chemically-induced nociception, which was comparable to that of P. domestica gum (200 mg/kg; P < 0.05, 400 mg/kg; P < 0.01)."
2018,30457390,Effects of Chitosan and Natamycin on Vacuum-Packaged Phyllo: A Pastry Product.,"The effects of vacuum packaging, chitosan (1.5%, w/v), and natamycin (10 mg/L, w/v) on phyllo pastry quality were studied by monitoring microbiological, chemical, and sensory changes. Five lots were prepared with or without vacuum packaging, chitosan, and natamycin: A, air packaged (control); V, vacuum packaged; VC, vacuum packaged with chitosan; VN, vacuum packaged with natamycin; and VCN, vacuum packaged with both chitosan and natamycin. Based on the sensory acceptability data, a shelf life of 6 (A), 12 (V), 14 (VN), 16 (VC), and 17 (VCN) days was obtained at 4°C. VCN treatment resulted in a shelf life extension of 11 days compared with the shelf life of the control. Microbiological data revealed that the combination of chitosan and natamycin resulted in significant reductions of microbial species (mesophilic total viable counts, yeasts and molds, psychrotrophic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and enterococci) of 1 to 3 log CFU/g on the final day (day 18) of storage. Results suggest that the combination of chitosan and natamycin, which is an effective antifungal agent, can delay the spoilage of phyllo pastry while maintaining acceptable sensorial characteristics and the original freshness and appearance of the product."
2017,28709990,In-vitro development of an effective treatment for Acanthamoeba keratitis.,"The aim of this study was to develop an in-vitro topical treatment for Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) effective against cysts and trophozoites. Qualitative assays were performed with voriconazole, chlorhexidine, propamidine, cellulase, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and paromomycin as monotherapy and various combinations. Riboflavin with ultraviolet-A (R + UV-A) as monotherapy or combined with voriconazole and moxifloxacin was also tested. Quantitative assays to assess cyst viability after treatment were performed for the chemicals that showed the highest activity in the qualitative assays. Paromomycin and propamidine did not show antiamoebic activity. Regardless of the total dose, no amoebicidal effect was observed for R + UV-A. Tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, voriconazole, chlorhexidine and cellulase were selected for quantitative assays because they appeared to cause greater damage to the structure of amoebae. Chlorhexidine and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Acanthamoeba spp. as monotherapy. Among the combinations evaluated, ciprofloxacin-voriconazole-chlorhexidine showed the greatest amoebicidal activity, with severe damage of the cellular membrane and an important decrease in cell concentration. In summary, ciprofloxacin as monotherapy and in combination with voriconazole and chlorhexidine has been classified as promising treatment. Additional in-vivo studies in animal models and clinical trials in patients with AK should be considered to confirm the efficacy of ciprofloxacin."
2008,18246887,Dietary supplements for osteoarthritis.,"A large number of dietary supplements are promoted to patients with osteoarthritis and as many as one third of those patients have used a supplement to treat their condition. Glucosamine-containing supplements are among the most commonly used products for osteoarthritis. Although the evidence is not entirely consistent, most research suggests that glucosamine sulfate can improve symptoms of pain related to osteoarthritis, as well as slow disease progression in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Chondroitin sulfate also appears to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms and is often combined with glucosamine, but there is no reliable evidence that the combination is more effective than either agent alone. S-adenosylmethionine may reduce pain but high costs and product quality issues limit its use. Several other supplements are promoted for treating osteoarthritis, such as methylsulfonylmethane, Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), Curcuma longa (turmeric), and Zingiber officinale (ginger), but there is insufficient reliable evidence regarding long-term safety or effectiveness."
2017,28077102,Effects of aqueous extracts of Taraxacum Officinale on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 in LPS-stimulated RMMVECs.,"Mastitis gives rise to big financial burden to farm industry (mainly dairy production) and public health. Its incidence is currently high and therefore, highly effective treatments for therapy, especially with natural products are required. Taraxacum officinale has been reported to use for anti-inflammation. However, its effect on endothelium during mastitis has not been reported.We firstly established inflammation experimental model of rat mammary microvascular endothelial cells (RMMVECs). We evaluated the effects of dandelion leaf aqueous extracts (DAE) on LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators in RMMVECs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. We treated RMMVECs with 1 μg/ml LPS for 4 h and then incubated with 10, 100 and 200 μg/mL DAE for 4, 8, 12 and 24 h. The expression (mRNA and protein level) of targets (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) was analyzed by employing real-time PCR and Western blots. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of DAE on mastitis within an Staphylococcus aureus-induced mouse model was also determined.The obtained results showed that dandelion extracts at the concentration of 100 and 200 μg/mL could significantly inhibit both TNF-α and ICAM-1 expression in all time points checked while 10 μg/mL of dandelion only suppress both expression at 8 and 12 h post-treatment. The in vivo tests showed that the DAE inhibited the expression of TNF-α and ICAM-1 in a time-dependent manner.All results suggest that the endothelium may use as as a possible target of dandelion for anti-inflammation."
2017,28253924,Withania somnifera leaf alleviates cognitive dysfunction by enhancing hippocampal plasticity in high fat diet induced obesity model.,"Sedentary lifestyle, psychological stress and labor saving devices in this current society often disrupts the energy gain and expenditure balance leading to obesity. High caloric diet is associated with the high prevalence of cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric disorders in addition to cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities. The present study was aimed to elucidate the potential beneficial effect of dry leaf powder of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) in preventing the cognitive decline associated with diet induced obesity.Experiments were performed on four groups of young adult female rats: [Low fat diet (LFD) rats fed on regular low fat chow, High fat diet (HFD) rats on feed containing 30% fat by weight, Low fat diet extract (LFDE) rats given regular chow and dry leaf powder of Ashwagandha 1 mg/g of body weight (ASH) and high fat diet extract (HFDE) rats fed on diet containing high fat and dry leaf powder of ASH. All the rats were kept on their respective diet regimen for 12 weeks.ASH treated rats showed significant improvement in their working memory and locomotor coordination during behavioral studies as compared to HFD rats. At the molecular level, ASH treatment was observed to restore the levels of BDNF and its receptor TRKB as well as the expression of other synaptic regulators, which are highly implicated in synaptic plasticity. Further, ASH triggered the activation of PI3/AKT pathway of cell survival and plasticity by enhancing the levels of phosphorylated Akt-1 and immediate early genes viz. c-Jun and c-fos.ASH could be a key regulator in maintaining the synaptic plasticity in HFD induced obesity and can serve as a nootropic candidate against obesity induced cognitive impairments."
1977,195500,Effects of heavy metals and of deficiency of zinc on mortality rates in mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus.,"Salts of cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel given orally to mice increased encephalomyocarditis virus-induced mortality rates. Although lead was the least toxic of the 4 metals, it enhanced the mortality the most. Concentrations of mercuric chloride as low as 0.01 ppm intensified the mortality; a minimal concentration that resulted in no effect was not ascertained. Zinc deficiency caused pronounced retardation of growth in young mice, but it did not influence mortality due to encephalomyocarditis virus."
1997,9386795,"A comprehensive evaluation of Agave attenuata, a candidate plant molluscicide in South Africa.","Dried leaf material of a Mexican plant, Agave attenuata, was found to be highly toxic to the target snail, Bulinus africanus, intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium in South Africa. The molluscicidal potency of the plant underwent seasonal variation, but remained stable over a range of pH values, after exposure to sunlight and organic matter, and during dry storage. It was unstable in aqueous suspension. The toxicity of the molluscicide to crop plants, invertebrates, fish and mammals was lacking or low. Given these properties, A. attenuata may provide a substitute for niclosamide and be used safely for snail control by rural communities."
2008,18325487,Nasturtium officinale reduces oxidative stress and enhances antioxidant capacity in hypercholesterolaemic rats.,"Nasturtium officinale R. Br. (Brassicaceae) has been used as a home remedy by the people of south eastern (SE) region of Iran as a medicinal plant. This therapeutical application has been attributed to Nasturtium officinale (N. officinale) antioxidant capacity which is mostly tested by means of cell-free assays: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In addition, the antioxidant effect of N. officinale extract has been investigated in hypercholesterolaemic rats in vivo. The results revealed that the extract has notable scavenging activity against DPPH radicals as well as potent reducing power in FRAP assay. Intragastric administration of N. officinale (500 mg/kg body weight per day) to groups of hypercholesterolaemic rats for 30 days lowered their blood total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 37, 44 and 48%, respectively. However, the blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the same treated rats increased by 16%. To evaluate the mechanism(s) of action, we studied the antioxidative potential of N. officinale extract in terms of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and also the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the liver tissues. In addition, hepatic tissue malondialdehyde level (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation) was also determined. Under hypercholesterolaemic condition, hepatic MDA was increased. Moreover, our data indicated GSH depletion along with significant reduction in the activities of CAT and SOD in rats fed high-fat diet rats. On the other hand, significant elevation in the activities of GPx and GR were seen in the same group of rats. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemic rats with N. officinale extract significantly increased the GSH level along with enhanced CAT and SOD activities in liver tissues. Furthermore, N. officinale extract significantly decreased hepatic MDA as well as GPx and GR activities in plant-treated rats. Based on our data, it can be concluded that N. officinale has a high hypolipidaemic activity and this may be attributed to its antioxidative potential."
2018,29644877,Protective effects of folic acid on DNA damage and DNA methylation levels induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in Kazakh esophageal epithelial cells.,"The protective effects of folic acid on DNA damage and DNA methylation induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Kazakh esophageal epithelial cells were investigated using a 3 × 3 factorial design trial. The cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to media containing different concentrations of folic acid and MNNG, after which growth indices were detected. DNA damage levels were measured using comet assays, and genome-wide DNA methylation levels (MLs) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The DNA methylation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and folate receptor-α (FRα) genes was detected by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results showed significant increases in tail DNA concentration, tail length, and Olive tail moment (p < 0.01); a significant reduction of genome-wide DNA MLs (p < 0.01); and an increase in the methylation frequencies of MTHFR and FRα genes. In particular, significant differences were observed in the promoter regions of both genes (p < 0.01). Our study indicated that a reduction in folic acid concentration promotes DNA damage and DNA methylation in Kazakh esophageal epithelial cells upon MNNG exposure. Thus, sufficient folic acid levels could play a protective role against the damage induced by this compound."
2017,29174034,Panax notoginseng saponins reduce high-risk factors for thrombosis through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -γ pathway.,"The classic Virchow theory suggests that blood stasis, hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction are three major factors that cause venous thrombosis (VT). It is a complicated biological process involved multi-factors. Platelet plays a central role and participates in multiple links of this process. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the principal constituents derived from panax notoginseng, has been widely described for its anti-platelet activity. However, its potential mechanism against platelet aggregation has not been clarified. In this present study, we evaluated the anti-platelet effects of PNS on thrombin-induced platelet activation and its possible molecular mechanism of action, and further explored the therapeutic action of PNS on thrombin induced hypercoagulability in rat. Our results showed that PNS treatment inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, which was accompanied with over-expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) protein, mRNA and upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt)/ endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway in platelet, and this effect could be reversed by PPAR-γ inhibitor T0070907. In vivo, PNS significantly reversed thrombin-induced hypercoagulable state in rat which was accompanied by PPAR-γ protein and mRNA upregulation in rat lung. In conclusion, these data suggested that PNS could suppress thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and effectively improve hypercoagulable state in vivo and PNS-induced activation of PPAR-γ and its downstream PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway played the central role."
2012,23214261,Effect of seabuckthorn extract on scopolamine induced cognitive impairment.,"Present study involves evaluation of effects of 75% ethanolic extract of seabuckthorn [Hippophae rhamnoides L. (SBT)] leaves on scopolamine induced cognitive impairment in rats using three different oral doses i.e. 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight through assessment of various biochemical and behavioural parameters. Scopolamine administration resulted in an increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (approximately 9% with respect to the control group) and malonaldehyde (MDA) content. The increased AChE activity was significantly reduced in animals receiving 200 and 100 mg/kg of SBT extract. Animals treated with SBT extract showed significantly reduced MDA level in all the doses. This reduction in MDA content indicates that SBT leaf extract has potent antioxidant activities and exhibits a protective effect against oxidative damage induced by scopolamine. Behavioural studies also indicated significant improvement. The results suggest that SBT leaf extract has potential effects against scopolamine induced cognitive impairment by regulating cholinergic marker enzyme activity (AChE activity) and promoting the antioxidant system and may be explored for its use in cognitive disorders."
,1535770,"Influence of dehydroepiandrosterone and 5-en-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells induced by 17 beta-estradiol.","The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 5-en-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol (ADIOL) on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells were studied both in steroid - free and estradiol (E2) supplemented media. Growth was evaluated by counting the cells after six days of culture. The results show that DHEA 500 nM and ADIOL 2 nM stimulate MCF-7 cell growth in steroid-free medium, while in medium supplemented with E2 1 nM they partly antagonize the stimulatory effect of the estrogen. The latter action is also shown by lower DHEA concentrations (20 nM, 100 nM), which have no effect when added to the steroid-free medium. Incubations carried out in the presence of labeled DHEA show its conversion to ADIOL. Moreover, tamoxifen counteracts in a dose-depended manner the stimulatory effect of DHEA and ADIOL, suggesting that it is mediated by an interaction with estrogen receptors."
1998,10076538,"Rat pancreatic islet and RINm5F cell responses to epiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and interleukin-1 beta.","Epiandrosterone (EA), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and their sulfate (-S) and acetate (-A) conjugates were investigated for effects on isolated pancreatic islets and RINm5F insulinoma cells. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release in cultured islets, but the presence of EA, EA-A, and to a lesser extent EA-S, preserved the secretory response. IL-1 beta also increased islet nitrite production, which was antagonized by EA and EA-A, but not by EA-S. EA, EA-A, DHEA, and DHEA-A, but not EA-S and DHEA-S inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release from islets. This response may be related to the inhibition of glucose transport by EA, EA-A, DHEA, DHEA-A, and DHEA-S, as observed in RINm5F cells. EA, EA-A, DHEA, and DHEA-A also inhibited glucose metabolism in RINm5F cells, whereas EA-S and DHEA-S had no effect. EA, EA-A, DHEA, and DHEA-A, but not the sulfate conjugates, also inhibited RINm5F cell IL-1 beta-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity. IL-1 beta also increased cytosolic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial Mn-SOD in RINm5F cells. EA inhibited RINm5F cell Cu/Zn-SOD in the presence and absence of IL-1 beta, whereas EA-S increased basal enzyme activity and did not affect the IL-1 beta response. EA did not affect basal Mn-SOD activity and inhibited IL-1 beta-stimulated activity, whereas EA-S was without effect. IL-1 beta had no effect on catalase activity in RINm5F cells, whereas EA, EA-A, and DHEA-A inhibited catalase activity. Thus, EA and DHEA and their acetate congeners protected the beta-cell from the inhibitory effects of IL-1 beta, and inhibited glucose transport and oxidation, and inducible nitricoxide synthase expression. EA and DHEA also had profound effects on Cu/Zn-SOD, which may alter the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide generation in beta-cells."
2009,19413661,Comparative evaluation of adenosine deaminase activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young and adult rats: effect of garlic extract (Allium sativum L.) on their susceptibility to heavy metal exposure.,"Adenosine plays an important neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system, and adenosine deaminase is an important enzyme in the degradation of adenine nucleotides. Methylmercury is the most prevalent form of mercury found in the environment. Methylmercury neurotoxicity has been correlated to the production of reactive oxygen species. In this study, its potential pathogenic effects were investigated in vitro in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats. We first observed that adenosine deaminase activity was higher in young rat brains when compared to the 60-day-old rats and was higher in hippocampus when compared to the cortex. Methylmercury (0.1, 1.0, 20 microM) inhibited adenosine deaminase activity in 7- and 60-day-old rats in a concentration-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that methylmercury-induced inhibition was antagonized by garlic alcoholic extract, but sodium selenate did not alter enzyme activity. In addition, glutathione and dithiothreitol restored the methylmercury-induced decrease of adenosine deaminase activity. These results demonstrated that there are age-related changes in adenosine deaminase activity and that thiol agents may contribute to the maintenance of adenosine deaminase activity and may be important in the neuromodulation of adenosine. Garlic alcoholic extract may be effective in reducing the effect of methylmercury-induced adenosine deaminase, which may be due to its sulphur-containing compounds."
1999,10365642,Grapefruit juice decreases the systemic availability of itraconazole capsules in healthy volunteers.,"The systemic availability of itraconazole capsules may be reduced secondary to elevated gastric pH and possibly by presystemic intestinal metabolism via CYP3A4. Grapefruit juice is acidic and an inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4. To determine the effect of grapefruit juice on the systemic availability of itraconazole capsules, serum itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole concentrations were determined in eleven healthy volunteers studied in a randomized, two-way crossover design. Concurrent grapefruit juice resulted in a 43% decrease in the mean itraconazole AUC0-48 (2507 ng x hr/mL versus 1434 ng x hr/mL, p = 0.046) and a 47% decrease in the mean hydroxy-itraconazole AUC0-72 (7264 ng x hr/mL versus 3880 ng x hr/mL, p = 0.025). Grapefruit juice also significantly increased the mean itraconazole Tmax (5.5 versus 4 hours). We conclude that concomitant grapefruit juice does not enhance the systemic availability of itraconazole capsules, but rather appears to impair itraconazole absorption. Therefore, concomitant grapefruit juice will not likely be useful in improving the oral availability of itraconazole capsules."
2007,17433615,[Improving perioperative management of oral anticoagulants in 2007].,"Preoperative interruption of oral anticoagulants is not essential for every procedure performed during surgery or outside of the operating room. The thrombotic risk associated with preoperative treatment interruption is too often overestimated. In practice, only patients at elevated risk should receive bridge therapy with standard or low-molecular-weight heparin. Patients with an INR less than 2 can undergo numerous surgical procedures. In the case of an immediate emergency in a patient treated with oral anticoagulants, perfusion with prothrombin complex is recommended. It is very effective and entails few risks. Vitamin K must be used as a complement, or alone in less urgent case, at a low-dose (< 5 mg) and preferably orally. The phase of treatment resumption with a postoperative double treatment of heparin and oral anticoagulants must last long enough to avoid any thrombosis."
2012,21871761,Supraventricular tachycardia induced by chocolate: is chocolate too sweet for the heart?,"Conflicting studies have been published concerning the association between chocolate and cardiovascular diseases. Fewer articles have described the potential arrhythmogenic risk related to chocolate intake. We present a case of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in a woman after consumption of large quantity of chocolate. A 53-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented to us with complaints of palpitations and shortness of breath after consuming large amounts of chocolate. Electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia at 165 beats per minute, which was restored to sinus rhythm after adenosine bolus injection. Electrophysiology studies showed atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, which are methylxanthines and are competitive antagonists of adenosine and can have arrhythmogenic potential. Our case very well describes an episode of tachycardia precipitated by large amount of chocolate consumption in a patient with underlying substrate. There are occasional case reports describing association between chocolate, caffeine, and arrhythmias. A large Danish study, however, did not find any association between amount of daily caffeine consumption and risk of arrhythmia."
2012,22619583,Antibiotic resistant Salmonella and Vibrio associated with farmed Litopenaeus vannamei.,"Salmonella and Vibrio species were isolated and identified from Litopenaeus vannamei cultured in shrimp farms. Shrimp samples showed occurrence of 3.3% of Salmonella and 48.3% of Vibrio. The isolates were also screened for antibiotic resistance to oxolinic acid, sulphonamides, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, norfloxacin, ampicillin, doxycycline hydrochloride, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and nitrofurantoin. Salmonella enterica serovar Corvallis isolated from shrimp showed individual and multiple antibiotic resistance patterns. Five Vibrio species having individual and multiple antibiotic resistance were also identified. They were Vibrio cholerae (18.3%), V. mimicus (16.7%), V. parahaemolyticus (10%), V. vulnificus (6.7%), and V. alginolyticus (1.7%). Farm owners should be concerned about the presence of these pathogenic bacteria which also contributes to human health risk and should adopt best management practices for responsible aquaculture to ensure the quality of shrimp."
2016,27618865,"KBH-1, an herbal composition, improves hepatic steatosis and leptin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese rats.","KBH-1 is an herbal mixture of Saururus chinensis, Curcuma longa and Polygala tenuifolia. Each herb has been reported to have various pharmaceutical activities; however, the synergistic effect of this herbal composition on obesity has not yet been determined. We investigated the alleviation effect of KBH-1 and its possible molecular mechanism in obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and leptin resistance in the hypothalamus.We used HepG2 cells, primary neuronal cells and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity rat model to determine the effect of KBH-1 in vitro and in vivo on hepatic steatosis and leptin resistance accompanied by obesity. To identify the alleviation effect on lipid accumulation, HepG2 cells stimulated by FFA were stained with Oil Red O; in addition, immunoblotting and qPCR were performed to determine the effect of KBH-1 on the activation of proteins and nuclear enzymes in HepG2 cells and the steatotic liver of HFD-induced obesity rats. To examine the effect of KBH-1 on the leptin resistance of the hypothalamus and its possible molecular mechanism, we examined the effect of KBH-1 on the activation of the leptin resistance-related protein in primary cultured cortical neuron cells and the hypothalamus of an HFD-induced obesity rat model. In addition, we used HPLC analysis to identify the standard compound of KBH-1.KBH-1 not only suppressed the lipid deposition in HepG2 cells exposed to free fatty acids (FFA) but also significantly down-regulated major factors in lipogenesis and up-regulated major factors in lipolysis. Similarly, in a HFD-induced obesity model, KBH-1 improved hepatic steatosis by alleviating the effects on lipogenic genes and kinases. In addition, KBH-1 significantly improved the leptin-mediated signals impaired by obesity or FFA in the obesity model and primary cultured cortical neuron cells. In addition, KBH-1 was analyzed to include six standard compounds using HPLC analysis, among these compounds, onji-saponin B and curcumin were potently suppressed the level of triglycerides.KBH-1 exhibits alleviating effects by improving hepatic steatosis and leptin resistance by up-regulating the activation of AMPK and suppressing the expression of PPARγ. These findings show the potential of KBH-1 as a functional food supplement or preventive agent in the treatment of obesity."
,17497042,Cardiovascular effects of Persea americana Mill (Lauraceae) (avocado) aqueous leaf extract in experimental animals.,"The cardiovascular effects of Persea americana Mill (Lauraceae) aqueous leaf extract (PAE) have been investigated in some experimental animal paradigms. The effects of PAE on myocardial contractile performance was evaluated on guinea pig isolated atrial muscle strips, while the vasodilatory effects of the plant extract were examined on isolated portal veins and thoracic aortic rings of healthy normal Wistar rats in vitro. The hypotensive (antihypertensive) effect of the plant extract was examined in healthy normotensive and hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats in vivo. P americana aqueous leaf extract (25-800 mg/ml) produced concentration-dependent, significant (p < 0.05-0.001), negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects on guinea pig isolated electrically driven left and spontaneously beating right atrial muscle preparations, respectively. Moreover, PAE reduced or abolished, in a concentration-dependent manner, the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses of guinea pig isolated atrial muscle strips induced by noradrenaline (NA, 10(-10)-10(-5) M), and calcium (Ca(2+), 5-40 mM). PAE (50-800 mg/ml) also significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001) or abolished, in a concentration-dependent manner, the rhythmic, spontaneous, myogenic contractions of portal veins isolated from healthy normal Wistar rats. Like acetylcholine (ACh, 10(-8)-10(-5) M), the plant extract (25- 800 mg/ml) produced concentration-related relaxations of isolated endothelium-containing thoracic aortic rings pre-contracted with noradrenaline. The vasorelaxant effects of PAE in the isolated, endothelium-intact aortic rings were markedly inhibited or annulled by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-5) M), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Furthermore, PAE (25-400 mg/kg iv) caused dose-related, transient but significant reductions (p < 0.05-0.001) in the systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rates of the anaesthetised normotensive and hypertensive rats used. The results of this laboratory animal study indicate that PAE caused bradycardia, vasorelaxation and hypotension in the mammalian experimental models used. The vasorelaxant action of PAE was endothelium dependent, and was, therefore, possibly dependent on the synthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO). The vasorelaxant effects of PAE appeared to contribute significantly to the hypotensive (antihypertensive) effects of the plant extract. However, the findings of this study tend to suggest that P americana leaf could be used as a natural supplementary remedy in essential hypertension and certain cases of cardiac dysfunctions in some rural Africa communities."
2013,24007270,"In vitro biological assessment of Berberis vulgaris and its active constituent, berberine: antioxidants, anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-diabetic and anticancer effects.","Berberis vulgaris is a well known plant with traditional herbal medical history. The aims of this study was to bioscreen and compare the in vitro biological activity (antioxidant, cholinergic, antidaibetic and the anticancer) of barberry crude extract and berberine active compound.The effect of B. vulgaris extract and berberine chloride on cellular thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) formation, diphenyle-α-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) oxidation, cellular nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging capability, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and α-gulcosidase activities were spectrophotometrically determined. On the other hand, the effect of extract and berberine as anticancer was estimated on three different cell lines which were MCF-7, HepG-2, and Caco-2 cells by using neutral red uptake assay which compared with control normal cells (PBMC).Our results showed that barberry crude extract contains 0.6 mg berberine/mg crude extract. Barberry extract showed potent antioxidative capacity through decreasing TBARS, NO and the oxidation of DPPH that associated with GPx and SOD hyperactivation. Inhibitory effect of berberis crude extract on α-glucosidase was more potent than that of berberine chloride, while both had the same AChE inhibitory effect. Besides, different concentrations of both berberine chloride and barberry ethanolic extract showed to have no growth inhibitory effect on normal blood cells (PBMC). Otherwise, both berberine chloride and barberry ethanolic extract showed to have inhibitory effect on the growth of breast, liver and colon cancer cell lines (MCF7, HepG2 and CACO-2, respectively) at different incubation times starting from 24 hrs up to 72 hrs and the inhibitory effect increased with time in a dose dependent manner.This work demonstrates the potential of the barberry crude extract and its active alkaloid, berberine, on suppressing lipid peroxidation, suggesting a promising use in the treatment of hepatic oxidative stress, Alzheimer and idiopathic male factor infertility. Beside, berberis vulgaris ethanolic extract is safe non-toxic extract as it was not inhibit the growth of PBMC that can induce cancer cell death that could return to its powerful antioxidant activity."
2012,21914238,"Interaction of soyasaponins with plant ingredients in diets for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L.","The effects of combining soyasaponins with plant ingredients on intestinal function and fish health were investigated in an 80 d study with Atlantic salmon (270 g) distributed thirty each into twenty-four tanks with seawater. Soyasaponins were supplemented (2 g/kg) to diets with maize gluten (MG), pea protein concentrate (PPC) and sunflower (SFM), rapeseed (RSM) or horsebean meals. A diet with soyabean meal (SBM) and another with wheat gluten and soyasaponins served as reference diets. Marked soyasaponin effects were observed when combined with PPC. This combination induced inflammation in the distal intestine (DI) similar to SBM, reduced feed intake, apparent digestibility of lipid, most amino acids and ash, decreased bile salt levels in intestinal chyme and decreased leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity but increased trypsin activity in the DI. No enteritis was observed in other diet groups, but small consistent negative soyasaponin effects were seen on lipid and fatty acid digestibility, faecal DM and LAP activity of the DI. Soyasaponin combination with RSM reduced digestibility of all nutrients including minerals. The mineral effect was also seen for SFM, whereas with MG and SFM a positive soyasaponin effect on feed intake was observed. Caution should be exercised to avoid ingredient combinations giving high saponin levels, a condition that appears to be a key factor in diet-induced enteritis together with certain plant ingredients."
2013,23768362,"Sensorially important aldehyde production from amino acids in model wine systems: impact of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, glutathione and sulphur dioxide.","The efficiency of different white wine antioxidant systems in preventing aldehyde production from amino acids by oxidative processes is not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of sulphur dioxide alone and in combination with either glutathione, ascorbic acid or its stereoisomer erythorbic acid, in preventing formation of the sensorially important compounds methional and phenylacetaldehyde from methionine and phenylalanine in model white wine. UHPLC, GC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS, flow injection analysis and luminescence sensors determined both compositional changes during storage, and sulphur dioxide-aldehyde apparent equilibrium constants. Depending on temperature (25 or 45°C) or extent of oxygen supply, sulphur dioxide was equally or more efficient in impeding the production of methional compared to the other antioxidant systems. For phenylacetaldehyde, erythorbic acid or glutathione with sulphur dioxide provided improved inhibition compared to sulphur dioxide alone, in conditions of limited oxygen consumption. The results also demonstrate the extent to which sulphur dioxide addition can lower the free aldehyde concentrations to below their aroma thresholds."
2016,27895462,Effects of resveratrol on P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A in vitro and on pharmacokinetics of oral saquinavir in rats.,"The intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) present a barrier to the oral absorption of saquinavir (SQV). Resveratrol (RESV) has been indicated to have modulatory effects on P-gp and CYP 3A. Therefore, this study was to investigate the effects of RESV on P-gp and CYP 3A activities in vitro and in vivo on oral SQV pharmacokinetics in rats.In vitro, intestinal microsomes were used to evaluate RESV effect on CYP 3A-mediated metabolism of SQV; MDR1-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII-MDR1) cells were employed to assess the impact of RESV on P-gp-mediated efflux of SQV. In vivo effects were studied using 10 rats randomly assigned to receive oral SQV (30 mg/kg) with or without RESV (20 mg/kg). Serial blood samples were obtained over the following 24 h. Concentrations of SQV in samples were ascertained using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.RESV (1-100 μM) enhanced residual SQV (% of control) in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with intestinal microsomes. RESV (1-100 μM) reduced the accumulation of SQV in MDCKII-MDR1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. A double peaking phenomenon was observed in the plasma SQV profiles in rats. The first peak of plasma SQV concentration was increased, but the second peak was reduced by coadministration with RESV. The mean AUC0-∞ of SQV was slightly decreased, with no statistical significance probably due to the high individual variation.RESV can alter the plasma SQV concentration profiles, shorten the Tmax of SQV. RESV might also cause a slight decrease tendency in the SQV bioavailability in rats."
2017,28084704,Hyperlipidemia: Drugs for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Adults.,"Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia."
2009,19062056,"Supplementation of diets for gestating sows with zinc amino acid complex and gastric intubation of suckling pigs with zinc-methionine on mineral status, intestinal morphology and bacterial translocation in lipopolysaccharide-challenged early-weaned pigs.","Eighty male pigs from 20 litters were used to evaluate dietary addition of 250mg/kg of Zn from zinc amino acid complex (ZnAA) to sows during the last trimester of gestation and gastric intubation of 40mg Zn from soluble zinc methionine (ZnMet) to suckling pigs at birth and on day 7 and 14 (weaning) on small intestinal morphology, Zn status and bacterial translocation in early-weaned pigs. At weaning, pigs were challenged with an intramuscular injection of saline without or with 120microg/kg BW of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from Escherichia coli O26:B6) and were euthanized 24h later prior to collection of intestinal lymph nodes and small intestinal sections. Zinc concentration in serum 7 days after birth and at weaning were higher in pigs from ZnAA-supplemented sows and those receiving gastric intubation with ZnMet (P=0.05 and P<0.0001, respectively). Post-weaning liver tissue concentrations for Zn (P<0.0001) and Fe (P=0.04) were higher and for Cu lower (P<0.0001) in pigs intubated with ZnMet. Pigs from ZnAA-supplemented compared with control-fed sows tended (P<0.1) to have increased villi height and villus:crypt ratio in the jejunum and higher (P=0.1) goblet cell counts in the ileum. Goblet cell counts of ZnMet-intubated (P=0.03) and LPS-challenged pigs (P=0.05) were also higher in the jejunum. Supplementation of ZnAA to gestating sows increased (P=0.04) E. coli colony forming unit counts in the small intestinal mesenteric lymph nodes of early-weaned pigs. In conclusion, dietary addition of ZnAA to gestating sows and gastric intubation of ZnMet improved Zn status of suckling pigs."
2017,28254020,Effect of sodium selenite on isoflavonoid contents and antioxidant capacity of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) sprouts.,"Isoflavonoid compositions, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and antioxidant capacity were evaluated in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) sprouts germinated after soaking with different sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) concentrations (0, 1 and 2mg/100g seeds). Chickpea seeds were germinated during four days at 24°C and the isoflavonoid profiles and concentrations evaluated by HPLC-UV daily during four days of germination. Eleven isoflavones and two pterocarpan phytoalexins forms were identified in sprouts, being malonylated formononetin glycoside, formononetin, isoformononetin glycoside and malonylated biochanin A glycoside the major compounds. Compared to untreated sprouts, total isoflavonoid, PAL activity and antioxidant capacity showed a remarkable increase of 83%, 56%, and 33%, respectively in chickpea sprouts that were treated with a high sodium selenite content (2mg/100g seeds). Results suggest that Se-enriched chickpea sprouts could represent a good source of dietary Se and as an upgraded source of isoflavonoids."
2018,29604586,Inhibitory effect of sinigrin on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells: Involvement of AMPK and MAPK pathways.,"Adipocyte differentiation is a critical adaptive response to nutritional overload and affects the metabolic outcome of obesity. Sinigrin (2-propenyl glucosinolate) is a glucosinolate belong to the glucoside contained in broccoli, brussels sprouts, and black mustard seeds. We investigated the effects of sinigrin on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and its underlying mechanisms. Sinigrin remarkably inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets and adipogenesis by downregulating the expression of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leptin and aP2. Sinigrin arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and increased the expression of p21 and p27. CDK2 expression was suppressed by sinigirn in MDI-induced adipocytes. Sinigrin increased the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that sinigrin has anti-adipogenic effects through AMPK, MAPK and ACC activation. Sinigrin also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-18. Taken together, these data suggest that sinigrin inhibits early-stage adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the AMPK and MAPK signaling pathways."
2017,27979294,Contents of capsaicinoids in chillies grown in Denmark.,"We have studied 15 different cultivars of chillies (Capsicum var.) grown in temperate climate Denmark and determined the contents of the four major capsaicinoids: capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, and homocapsaicin. From these contents we have, as commonly done for chillies, calculated the so-called pungency in Scoville heat units in order to compare with previous studies from other climatical zones. For three of the investigated cultivars, Serrano, Habanero and BIH Jolokia, for which reliable pungencies has previously been reported, we have found pungencies of 34,000±1400, 247,000±24,000 and 665,000±4000, respectively, which are all in the same ranges as found earlier for chillies grown in more traditional chilli growing areas. Furthermore we have found that the relative distribution of the four capsaicinoids in the 15 different cultivars is highly variable, with the content of capsaicin ranging from 31% to 71% of the total capsaicinoid content."
2010,20944422,Amelioration of oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death by chloroform fraction of bay leaves (Laurus nobilis).,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Laurus nobilis chloroform fraction (LNCF) protects against cerebral ischemia neuronal damage. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and brain slices from rats were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), followed by reoxgenation with and without LNCF. The viabilities of SH-SY5Y cells and brain slices from the rats were 58.5±4.9% and 79.7±5.9% in the group subjected to OGD, and 80.4±0.4% and 97.2±1.9% at 4 µg/ml of LNCF, respectively. LNCF also significantly inhibited death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) dephosphorylation. Pretreatment with LNCF at 4 mg/kg significantly decreased infarct size by 79% of vehicle control in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo model. LNCF is a neuroprotective drug candidate against cerebral ischemia neuronal damage."
2017,28764063,Hard cap espresso extraction and liquid chromatography determination of bioactive compounds in vegetables and spices.,"A new analytical procedure, based on liquid chromatography with diode array and fluorescence detection, has been proposed for the determination of bioactive compounds in vegetables and spices after hard cap espresso extraction. This novel extraction system has been tested for the determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin from fresh chilli and sweet pepper, piperine from ground pepper, curcumin from turmeric and curry, and myristicin from nutmeg. Extraction efficiency was evaluated by using acetonitrile:water and ethanol:water mixtures. The proposed method allows the extraction of samples with 100mL of 60% (v/v) ethanol in water. The obtained limits of quantification for the proposed procedure ranged from 0.07 to 0.30mgg-1 and results were statistically comparable with those obtained by ultrasound assisted extraction. Hard cap espresso machines offer a fast, effective and quantitative tool for the extraction of bioactive compounds from food samples with an extraction time lower than 30s, using a global available and low cost equipment."
1993,7687165,Human plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin and von Willebrand factor possess covalently linked ABO(H) blood group antigens in subjects with corresponding ABO phenotype.,"We recently identified ABO(H) blood group structures in Asn-linked sugar chains of human von Willebrand factor (vWF) purified from factor VIII concentrates (J Biol Chem 267:8723, 1992). We surveyed plasma glycoproteins carrying ABO(H) blood group antigens by Western blotting analysis and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using blood group-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and a lectin. Two major plasma proteins showing apparent molecular weight of about 180 Kd and 270 Kd by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reacted with blood group-specific MoAbs and Ulex europaeus lectin I in accordance with donor blood group. Direct sequence analysis of the protein bands showed their identity with the N-terminal sequences of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and vWF, respectively. The two bands also reacted with anti-alpha 2M and anti-vWF antibodies. The alpha 2M and vWF prepared from plasma by immunoprecipitation showed the appropriate blood group antigenicity. After incubation with endoglycosidase F, both alpha 2M and vWF lost almost all reactivity with anti-blood group reagents. About 90% of plasma vWF, but only approximately 10% of alpha 2M, was immunoprecipitated with anti-blood group antibody. These results indicate that at least two plasma glycoproteins, vWF and alpha 2M, possess Asn-linked ABO(H) blood group antigens in normal individuals with corresponding ABO phenotype. Therefore, ABO(H) blood group antigens in plasma glycoproteins should be considered during preparation of plasma materials for therapeutic use."
2015,25663614,Adverse effects of thiram-treated seed ingestion on the reproductive performance and the offspring immune function of the red-legged partridge.,"Pesticide research traditionally has focused on compounds with high acute toxicity or persistence, but the adverse sublethal effects of pesticides with different properties also may have important consequences on exposed wildlife. The authors studied the effects of thiram, a fungicide used for seed coating with known effects as endocrine disruptor. Red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa; n = 15 pairs per treatment group) were fed wheat treated with 0%, 20%, or 100% of the thiram application rate used in autumn (25 d) and late winter (10 d) to mimic cereal sowing periods. The authors studied the effects on reproductive performance, carotenoid-based ornamentation and cellular immune responsiveness of adult partridges, and their relationship with changes in oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma biochemistry. The authors also studied the effect of parental exposure on egg antioxidant content and on the survival, growth, and cellular immune response of offspring. Exposure to thiram-coated seeds delayed egg laying, reduced clutch size, and affected egg size and eggshell thickness. Partridges exposed to the 20% thiram dose exhibited reduced egg fertility and brood size (55% and 28% of controls, respectively). Chick survival was unaffected by parental exposure to treated seeds, but adverse effects on their growth rate and cellular immune response were apparent. These effects on reproduction and immune function may have important demographic consequences on farmland bird populations."
2008,18801029,Cardioprotective effects of Nigella sativa oil on cyclosporine A-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.,"Cyclosporine A is a well-known immunosuppressor agent universally used in allotransplantation. However, it has been demonstrated that this drug produces side-effects in several organs, particularly in the kidney and in the heart. Nigella sativa oil has long been used in folk medicine for a wide range of illnesses. One of the potential properties of N. sativa oil is the ability of one or more of its constituents to reduce toxicity due to its antioxidant activities. The antioxidant effects of N. sativa oil have been examined using different hepatic and kidney toxicity in in vivo murine models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of N. sativa oil in the antioxidant enzyme status and myocardium of cyclosporine-A-treated rats. This study included 24 male Wistar albino young healthy rats (8-12 weeks) weighing 150-200 g. The control group received sunflower oil (21 days, 2 ml/kg/day, orally) without any treatment. The second group received only N. sativa oil (21 days, 2 ml/kg, orally) (N. sativa oil group). The animals in the third group received only cyclosporine A (21 days, 25 mg/kg, orally) (cyclosporine A group). The animals in the fourth group were treated with cyclosporine A (21 days, 25 mg/kg, orally) and starting one day before cyclosporine A administration were treated with N. sativa oil (21 days, 2 ml/kg, orally) (cyclosporine A +N. sativa oil group). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the heart tissues were significantly reduced in the cyclosporine A group compared to control values. Nigella sativa oil treatment caused an increase in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px compared to the control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide and protein carbonyl (PC) levels were increased in the cyclosporine A-treated group in comparison with the control and N. sativa groups. Co-administration of N. sativa oil and cyclosporine A abrogated the cyclosporine A-induced MDA, N. sativa oil and PC increase compared to the cyclosporine A group. The results of our study show that pre-treatment with N. sativa oil reduced the subsequent cyclosporine A injury in rat heart, demonstrated by normalized cardiac histopathology, decrease in lipid peroxidation, improvement in antioxidant enzyme status and cellular protein oxidation."
1977,192110,Isolation and characterization of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in eastern Washington.,"A virus was isolated from the spleen of a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) that had died during an epizootic in Washington state in 1967. Inoculation of a 10% spleen suspension from the deer caused hemorrhagic disease in normal white-tailed deer. Studies were conducted on the biological, physicochemical, and serologic properties of the Washington isolate. An in vitro assay system, utilizing a cultured primary of white-tailed deer fetal cells from an entire fetus, was employed for isolation and propagation of the virus. Cytopathic effect was characterized by focal development of rounded and clumped cells. Propagation was unsuccessful in suckling mice, BHK-21, and Vero cell cultures. The virus was resistant to treatment with ether, sodium deoxycholate, trypsin, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and was sensitive to chloroform. Virus yield was not affected when infected cultures were treated with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, but dactinomycin (actinomycin D) treatment of infected cultures reduced virus yield. The virus was inactivated when heated at 70 C for 5 minutes or when exposed to pH 5 for 18 hours at 4 C. The virus was completely excluded from the filtrate by a 0.10- micronm (APD) membrane filter. Staining of infected cells with acridine orange indicated the presence of double-standard nucleic acid in the cytoplasm. Serum-neutralization tests with antiserums against the homologous virus and the New Jersey and Alberta strains of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus resulted in neutralization of the Washington isolate. The Washington virus was not neutralized by bluetongue virus antiserum. Cells infected with the Washington isolate exhibited intracytoplasmic fluorescence by the indirect fluorescent antibody method with New Jersey and Alberta epizootic hemorrhagic disease antiserums but not with bluetongue antiserum."
,10715890,The investigations into the interferon-like activity of Polygonum L. genus.,"The interferon inducing abilities of eleven ethanolic extracts obtained from nine taxons of Polygonum L. genus, were tested in the cell culture of monkey kidney. The extracts from the herb of Polygonum amphibium L. and the rhizome and fruit of Polygonum bistorta L. induced a substance showing an interferon-like activity. Biological activity studies showed that the protective titre (the highest dilution which protected cells by 50% against virus infection) of the interferon-like materials was 1:10-1:15."
2018,29775894,Positive effects of antitumor drugs in combination with propolis on canine osteosarcoma cells (spOS-2) and mesenchymal stem cells.,"The combination of lower concentrations of antitumor drugs (carboplatin - CARB, doxorubicin - DOX, and methotrexate - MET) with propolis was investigated against canine osteosarcoma (spOS-2) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in vitro. The mechanism of action in the combinations was analyzed. spOS-2 cells were incubated up to 72 h with propolis (50 μg/ml) alone or in combination with CARB (10-400 μmol/l), DOX (0.5-2 μmol/l) or MET (50-200 μmol/l). Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, apoptosis/necrosis by flow cytometry, and MSC was incubated with the optimum combination. Propolis alone exerted no cytotoxic action against spOS-2 cells, whereas CARB (400, 200 and 100 μmol/l) exhibited the highest cytotoxic effects comparing to DOX and MET. The combination of propolis with the lowest concentrations of CARB led to better results comparing to CARB alone, which was not observed using DOX and MET. Apoptosis was involved in the action of propolis + CARB in spOS-2 cells. MSC were not affected by CARB/propolis, indicating that the cytotoxic action of the combination was specific to tumor cells but not to normal ones. Propolis improved the action of CARB against spOS-2 cells using lower concentrations of this drug, without affecting MSC. These findings are relevant and indicate a possible application of propolis in OSA treatment."
2014,25273391,Anti-adipogenic constituents from Dioscorea opposita in 3T3-L1 cells.,"We previously reported the lipase inhibitory activity of the n-BuOH fraction of Dioscorea opposita (DOB) and its isolates. This study sought to evaluate their anti-adipogenic activity in terms of their effects on the adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) as well as phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1). DOB apparently attenuated 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (33.6% decrease at 20 µg/mL). In addition, a marked decrease (90.4%) in the expression of PPARγ was observed in the DOB-treated 3T3-L1 cells. Four isolates from DOB: (4E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,6-heptadien-3-one (1), (3R,5R)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-heptanediol (2), batatasin I (3), and (1E,4E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (4), suppressed adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting PPARγ at 20 µM (85.9%, 68.6%, 76.2%, and 90.2% decrease, respectively) and C/EBPα (51.7%, 3.1%, 20.9%, and 59.8% decrease, respectively). Batatasin I was found to increase p-AMPK and CPT-1 at a concentration of 20 µM in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, resulting in inhibiting adipogenesis. Taken together, batatasin I might be responsible for the anti-adipogenic effect of DOB via inhibition of PPARγ and C/EBPα and activation of p-AMPK and CPT-1."
2015,26310874,"Resveratrol induces chemosensitization to 5-fluorouracil through up-regulation of intercellular junctions, Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis in colorectal cancer.","5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a common chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), by itself has inadequate response rates; highlighting the need for novel and improved treatment regimens for these patients. Resveratrol, a naturally-occurring polyphenol, has been linked with chemosensitizing potential and anticancer properties; however, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. The effect of resveratrol in parental CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW480) and their corresponding isogenic 5-FU-chemoresistant derived clones (HCT116R, SW480R) was examined by MTT assays, intercellular junction formation and apoptosis by electron- and immunoelectron microscopy, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and NF-κB regulated gene products by western blot analysis in a 3D-alginate microenvironment. Resveratrol blocked the proliferation of all four CRC cell lines and synergized the invasion inhibitory effects of 5-FU. Interestingly, resveratrol induced a transition from 5-FU-induced formation of microvilli to a planar cell surface, which was concomitant with up-regulation of desmosomes, gap- and tight junctions (claudin-2) and adhesion molecules (E-cadherin) expression in HCT116 and HCT116R cells. Further, resveratrol significantly attenuated drug resistance through inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors (decreased vimentin and slug, increased E-cadherin) and down-regulation of NF-κB activation and its translocation to the nucleus and abolished NF-κB-regulated gene end-products (MMP-9, caspase-3). Moreover, this suppression was mediated through inhibition of IκBα kinase and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Our results demonstrate that resveratrol can potentiate the anti-tumor effects of 5-FU on CRC cells by chemosensitizing them, inhibiting an EMT phenotype via up-regulation of intercellular junctions and by down-regulation of NF-κB pathway.

2014,24875446,Assessment of the potential of polyphenols as a CYP17 inhibitor free of adverse corticosteroid elevation.,"Inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17), which dictates the proceeding of androgen biosynthesis, is recommended as an effective treatment for androgen-dependent diseases. However, androgen depletion by selective CYP17 inhibition is accompanied with corticosteroid elevation, which increases risk of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we evaluated the likelihood of polyphenols as a CYP17 inhibitor without cardiovascular complications. All examined polyphenols significantly inhibited CYP17 in human adrenocortical H295R cells, but their effects on androgen and cortisol biosynthesis were diverse. Resveratrol was the most potent CYP17 inhibitor with an approximate IC50 of 4 μM, and the inhibition might weigh on the 17α-hydroxylase activity more than the 17,20-lyase activity. Resveratrol also inhibited 21α-hydroxylase (CYP21) essential for corticosteroid biosynthesis but to a lesser extent, thus preventing the occurrence of cortisol elevation following CYP17 blockade. Although transcriptional down-regulation was important for α-naphthoflavone-mediated CYP17 inhibition, resveratrol inhibited CYP17 and CYP21 mainly at the level of enzyme activity rather than enzyme abundance and cytochrome P450 electron transfer. Daidzein also inhibited CYP17 and CYP21 although less potent than resveratrol. Daidzein was the only polyphenol showing inhibition of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (3βHSD2). The exceptional 3βHSD2 inhibition led to dehydroepiandrosterone accumulation alongside daidzein-caused androgen biosynthetic impairment. In contrast, androgen and cortisol secretion was increased or remained normal under α-naphthoflavone and β-naphthoflavone treatments, suggesting that CYP17 inhibition was counteracted by increased substrate generation. α-naphthoflavone and β-naphthoflavone also enhanced the formation of cortisol from 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone from androstenedione. Our findings suggest a potential application of resveratrol in androgen deprivation therapy."
2012,23373097,Grapefruit and drug interactions.,"Since the late 1980s, grapefruit juice has been known to affect the metabolism of certain drugs. Several serious adverse effects involving drug interactions with grapefruit juice have been published in detail. The components of grapefruit juice vary considerably depending on the variety, maturity and origin of the fruit, local climatic conditions, and the manufacturing process. No single component accounts for all observed interactions. Other grapefruit products are also occasionally implicated, including preserves, lyophylised grapefruit juice, powdered whole grapefruit, grapefruit seed extract, and zest. Clinical reports of drug interactions with grapefruit juice are supported by pharmacokinetic studies, each usually involving about 10 healthy volunteers, in which the probable clinical consequences were extrapolated from the observed plasma concentrations. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme most often involved in drug metabolism. This increases plasma concentrations of the drugs concerned, creating a risk of overdose and dose-dependent adverse effects. Grapefruit juice also inhibits several other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, but they are less frequently implicated in interactions with clinical consequences. Drugs interacting with grapefruit and inducing serious clinical consequences (confirmed or very probable) include: immunosuppressants, some statins, benzodiazepines, most calcium channel blockers, indinavir and carbamazepine. There are large inter-individual differences in enzyme efficiency. Along with the variable composition of grapefruit juice, this makes it difficult to predict the magnitude and clinical consequences of drug interactions with grapefruit juice in a given patient. There is increasing evidence that transporter proteins such as organic anion transporters and P-glycoprotein are involved in interactions between drugs and grapefruit juice. In practice, numerous drugs interact with grapefruit juice. Although only a few reports involving severe clinical consequences have been published, they suggest that grapefruit juice should be avoided during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects. Patients should be informed of this risk whenever a drug is prescribed or dispensed."
1979,118689,Effects of cyclophosphamide on the lymphoid tissues and humoral and cellular immune responsiveness of young calves.,"Cyclophosphamide (CY) was given IV to 5-month-old calves (ten doses; each dose of 5.0 mg/kg, 2-day intervals between doses). The effects of CY on circulating leukocytes, lymphoid tissues, and the humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed. The numbers of total leukocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils and platelets decreased significantly. The lymphocyte population was depleted in the cortex of the thymus and B-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes. Significant decreases occurred in the frequency of the peripheral blood lymphocytes-bearing surface immunoglobulin (Ig) and in serum IgM and IgG concentrations. Primary serum antibody responses to avian erythrocytes and Brucella abortus strain 19 antigens were diminished or delayed. The blastogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin P, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and to purified protein derivative and B abortus antigens were enhanced as was the delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculin skin test. While a diminished humoral immune response was associated with CY treatment, the cell-mediated response was potentiated. The effect of CY was transitory with most variables returning to near base line within 24 days after CY was ceased."
2014,24914722,Screening for impact of popular herbs improving mental abilities on the transcriptional level of brain transporters.,"There are a number of compounds that can modify the activity of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) and SLC (solute carrier) transporters in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of natural and synthetic substances on the expression level of genes encoding transporters present in the BBB (mdr1a, mdr1b, mrp1, mrp2, oatp1a4, oatp1a5 and oatp1c1). Our results showed that verapamil caused the greatest reduction in the mRNA level while other synthetic (piracetam, phenobarbital) and natural (codeine, cyclosporine A, quercetin) substances showed a selective inhibitory effect. Further, the extract from the roots of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer exhibited a decrease of transcription against selected transporters whereas the extract from Ginkgo biloba L. leaves resulted in an increase of the expression level of tested genes, except for mrp2. Extract from the aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum L. was the only one to cause an increased mRNA level for mdr1 and oatp1c1. These findings suggest that herbs can play an important role in overcoming the BBB and multidrug resistance to pharmacotherapy of brain cancer and mental disorders, based on the activity of selected drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters located in the BBB."
2012,22640008,Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: outcome in a 20-year cohort.,"The curative potential of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo HSCT) in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL is established, with a demonstrated role for graft-versus-leukaemia and less certainty for other factors in determining outcome. The first two decades of CLL patients proceeding to allo HSCT at the Leukaemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia (n = 49 consecutive, 1991-2009) were studied to clarify factors predicting outcome. The donor was related in 29 (59%) and unrelated in 20 (41%). Conditioning was reduced-intensity in 27 (55%) and myeloablative in 22 (45%). Thirty-one of 49 patients survive with median follow-up of 5 years (0·2-15). Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality; complete remission (CR); clearance of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) abnormality and progression at 10 years was 36%; 69%; 55% and 22%. Overall survival (OS) was 63% at 2 years; 55% at 5 years and beyond. Factors predicting OS (P value by log rank <0·05) were: comorbidity index <3, FISH rank (Dohner) and 17p deletion, alemtuzumab pre-HSCT, achievement of CR post-HSCT, donor chimerism >90%, clearance of FISH abnormality post-HSCT and absence of high-grade (3-4) graft-versus-host disease. Results from this province-wide, two-decade cohort demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients with high-risk CLL become long term disease-free survivors."
2017,29070038,Water extract of Rumex crispus prevents bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and inducing osteoblast mineralization.,"Rumex crispus root has traditionally been used in Asian medicine for the treatment of hemorrhage and dermatolosis. The aim of this study was to explore the pharmaceutical effects of water extract of Rumex crispus (WERC) on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. We also studied the effect of WERC on the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced trabecular bone destruction mice model.High performance liquid chromatography analysis was used to identify three compounds (emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion) of WERC. The in vivo effect of WERC was examined using an administration of WERC or vehicle on the ICR mice with bone loss induced by intraperitoneal RANKL injection on day 0 and 1. All mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at day 7 and the femurs of mice were isolated for soft X-ray and Micro-CT analysis. The in vitro effect of WERC on osteoblast mineralization or osteoclast differentiation was examined by alizarin red S staining or by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and assay. To determine the transcription level of osteoblast or osteoclast-specific genes, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used. Western blot analysis was performed to study the effect of WERC on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling molecules.The presence of three compounds in WERC was determined. WERC significantly suppressed RANKL-induced trabecular bone loss by preventing microstructural deterioration. In vitro, WERC increased osteoblast mineralization by enhancing the transcription of runt-related transcription factor 2 and its transcriptional coactivators, and by stimulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, WERC significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation by suppressing the activation of the RANKL signalings (MAPK and NF-κB) and the increasing inhibitory factors of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1.This study showed that WERC could protect against osteoporosis and suggested that the possible mechanism of WERC might be related to increased osteoblast differentiation by activating Runx2 signaling and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by suppression of RANKL signaling."
2012,23033114,Fruit juices as perpetrators of drug interactions: the role of organic anion-transporting polypeptides.,"Grapefruit juice is widely recognized to cause important drug interactions via inhibition of CYP3A4, and a wider variety of fruit juices have been shown to inhibit influx transporters in enterocytes known as organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). Fruit juice coadministration significantly reduces the oral bioavailability of numerous important medicines relying on this anion transporter pathway for absorption. This article reviews the current literature on interactions between clinically used OATP substrates and fruit juice consumption."
2008,19114390,Dietary sources of aldose reductase inhibitors: prospects for alleviating diabetic complications.,"Activation of polyol pathway due to increased aldose reductase activity is one of the several mechanisms that have been implicated in the development of various secondary complications of diabetes. Though numerous synthetic aldose reductase inhibitors have been tested, these have not been very successful clinically. Therefore, a number of common plant/ natural products used in Indian culinary have been evaluated for their aldose reductase inhibitory potential in the present study. The aqueous extracts of 22 plant-derived materials were prepared and evaluated for the inhibitory property against rat lens and human recombinant aldose reductase. Specificity of these extracts towards aldose reductase was established by testing their ability to inhibit a closely related enzyme viz, aldehyde reductase. The ex vivo incubation of erythrocytes in high glucose containing medium was used to underscore the significance in terms of prevention of intracellular sorbitol accumulation. Among the 22 dietary sources tested, 10 showed considerable inhibitory potential against both rat lens and human recombinant aldose reductase. Prominent inhibitory property was found in spinach, cumin, fennel, lemon, basil and black pepper with an approximate IC50 of 0.2 mg/mL with an excellent selectivity towards aldose reductase. As against this, 10 to 20 times higher concentrations were required for 50% inhibition of aldehyde reductase. Reduction in the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol by the dietary extracts further substantiated their in vivo efficacy. The findings reported here indicate the scope of adapting life-style modifications in the form of inclusion of certain common sources in the diet for the management of diabetic complications."
2018,29855986,"Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® versus pentoxifylline in chronic tinnitus: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.","Background Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761® and pentoxifylline are frequently prescribed for the treatment of tinnitus. Objective To compare the treatment effects of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761R and pentoxifylline. Setting The study was performed at Department of Otorhinolaryngology of University Hospital Královské Vinohrady and 3rd Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague. Method Patients with sub-chronic or chronic tinnitus were enrolled in double-blind trial and randomized to receive 120 mg EGb 761® or 600 mg pentoxifylline, each twice a day and in double-dummy fashion over a 12-week period. Main outcome measure changes in 11-Point Box Scales for tinnitus loudness and annoyance, the abridged Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results Full analysis set for efficacy analysis comprised 197 patients (EGb 761®, 99; pentoxifylline 98). For both treatment groups, significant improvements were observed in the Mini-TQ, the 11-Point Box Scales for tinnitus loudness and annoyance, the HADS anxiety score and the SDS. There was no relevant difference with regard to tinnitus-related outcomes between the two treatment groups. 20 adverse events were documented in EGb 761® group and 36 adverse events were reported for pentoxifylline group. No serious adverse event was reported during the study. Conclusion EGb 761® and pentoxifylline were similarly effective in reducing the loudness and annoyance of tinnitus as well as overall suffering of the patients. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the EGb 761® group."
1992,1729759,Renal metallothionein metabolism after a reduction of renal mass. II. Effect of zinc pretreatment on the renal toxicity and intrarenal accumulation of inorganic mercury.,"In the present study we examined the effects of zinc pretreatment (to induce the renal synthesis of metallothionein) on the renal accumulation and intrarenal distribution of inorganic mercury in uninephrectomized (NPX) and sham-operated (SO) rats 24 h after the animals were given a 0.75, 1.0 or 1.5 mumol/kg intravenous (i.v.) dose of inorganic mercury. We also examined the effects of zinc pretreatment on the nephropathy induced by the three doses of inorganic mercury. Zinc was administered at a dose of 306 mumol/kg (20 mg/kg) subcutaneously (s.c.) in the form of zinc sulfate once daily for 2 consecutive days prior to the administration of inorganic mercury. Following zinc pretreatment, the renal accumulation of injected inorganic mercury increased in both NPX and SO rats treated with the three doses of inorganic mercury, but the increase was significantly greater in the NPX rats. The enhanced accumulation of mercury was associated with an altered pattern in the intrarenal distribution of mercury, particularly in the NPX rats. The increased renal accumulation of mercury in both the NPX and SO rats was due primarily to its increase in the renal cortex. We have recently found that the synthesis of metallothionein in the renal cortex increases in NPX and SO rats given zinc. Therefore, it appears that there is a relationship between the content of preinduced cellular metallothionein in the cortex and the content of mercury that accumulates in the cortex. Zinc pretreatment also prevented the nephropathy induced by the three doses of inorganic mercury from occurring in both the NPX and SO rats. We propose that some of the protection may be related to the altered intrarenal accumulation and distribution of mercury that occurs after pretreatment with zinc. Hepatic accumulation of mercury also increased in both groups of rats, but the increase again was significantly greater in the NPX rats. Our findings show clearly that a significant reduction in renal mass alters the hepatic and renal accumulation of mercury when zinc pretreatment is used to induce the renal and hepatic synthesis of metallothionein. In addition, our findings show that zinc pretreatment protects both normal and remnant kidneys in rats from the nephrotoxic effects of inorganic mercury."
2016,26923792,Challenges and Treatment for Stroke Prophylaxis in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in Mexico: A Review.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. AF-related strokes cause greater disability and mortality than those in patients without AF, and are associated with a significant clinical and economic burden in Mexico. Antithrombotic therapy reduces stroke risk in patients with AF and is recommended for all patients except those classified as having a low stroke risk. However, its use is suboptimal all around the world; one study showed that only 4 % of Mexican patients with AF who presented with ischemic stroke were in the therapeutic range for anticoagulation. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin or acenocoumarin have long been the only oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in AF. Although effective, VKAs have disadvantages, including the need for regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Interactions with numerous common medications and foods contribute to the risk of serious bleeding and thrombotic events in VKA-treated patients. Thus novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), more properly called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban (not available in Mexico), have been developed. These offer the convenience of fixed-dose treatment without the need for monitoring, and have few drug or food interactions. Pivotal phase III trials have demonstrated that these agents are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke and are associated with a reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage. With apixaban approved in Mexico in April 2013, clinicians now have the choice of three novel DOACs as alternatives to warfarin. However, it is yet to be established which of these agents should be the first choice, and treatment decisions are likely to depend on the individual patient's characteristics. "

It has been demonstrated that TB increases the absorption of EC in a dose-dependent manner. Cocoa powder had a similar effect, and the mechanism involved is not thought to depend on tight junctions."
2007,18543424,[Atherogenic properties of milk fat--facts or myths?].,"Since long time edible fats are classified into two groups of food products: atherogenic or antisclerotic ones. Animal fats are considered as atherogenic ones because of high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, and margarines and plant oils are, without reason, counted as food with antisclerotic activity. Milk fat, included among animal ones, does not impend over sclerosis, on the contrary, it prevents diseases of cardiovascular system, because it contains various bioactive constituents, that: limit synthesis of liver cholesterol and triglycerides (short chain saturated fatty acids, Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid); intensify estrification and metabolism of cholesterol (phospholipids, oleic acid, Omega-6 and Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in optimal proportions); prevent cholesterol oxidation (conjugated linoleic acid--CLA, alpha-tokoferol, coenzym Q10, vitamins A and D3, phospholipids), reduce level of LDL-cholesterol in blood plasma (linolenic acids Omega-3, linoleic acid W-6, also oleic acid). Unique components of milk fat i.e. short chain saturated fatty, conjugated linoleic acid, vaccenic acid (natural trans isomer), and other milk components possess additionally anticancerogenic activity."
1997,9339749,Inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenic response in healthy donors treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF): possible role of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.,"The effects of rhG-CSF on lymphocyte blastogenesis were evaluated in six healthy donors, submitted to progenitor cell mobilization for allogeneic transplantation. Neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte count increased 6.7-fold, 5.3-fold and 2.0-fold on day +4 of rhG-CSF as compared with baseline. The DNA stimulation index (DNA SI) of 72 h phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-treated cultures decreased from 20% (15-35.5) prior to rhG-CSF to 6.7% (1.5-11.9; P = 0.0026), 8% (4-12; P = 0.0091) and 15% (9-22; P = 0.0091) on days +2, +4 and +6; similarly, reactivity to concanavalin A decreased from 18% (12-20) to 1.8% (0.5-7; P < 0.01), 3% (2-8; P < 0.01) and 5% (2-11; P = 0.009). No changes of lymphocyte response to pokeweed mitogen were observed. DNA SI of PHA-treated cultures inversely correlated with neutrophil and monocyte count. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and lactoferrin (Lf) plasma levels sharply increased and correlated with neutrophil and monocyte count. IL-10 increased five-fold on day +2, returned to pretreatment values thereafter and did not show any correlation with DNA SI, suggesting that it was not responsible for the observed phenomena. Interestingly, DNA SI of PHA-treated cultures inversely correlated with IL-1ra and Lf levels. CD3+ and CD19+ lymphocyte activation status, ie CD23, CD25, CD30 and HLA-DR coexpression, was not affected by rhG-CSF administration. Pharmacological doses of rhG-CSF in healthy donors inhibit lymphocyte blastogenesis via an increased production and/or release of immunoregulatory soluble mediators, ie IL-1ra and Lf, by primed neutrophils and monocytes."
2001,11695850,"Roles of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes in the 2-hydroxylation of 1,4-cineole, a monoterpene cyclic ether, by rat and human liver microsomes.","1. Oxidation of 1,4-cineole, a monoterpene cyclic ether, was studied in rat and human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes expressed in insect cells in which human P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase cDNAs have been introduced. On analysis with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 2-exo-hydroxy-1,4-cineole was identified as a principal oxidation product of 1,4-cineole catalysed by rat and human P450 enzymes. 2. CYP3A4 was a major enzyme involved in the 2-hydroxylation of 1,4-cineole by human liver microsomes, based on the following lines of evidence. First, 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation activities catalysed by human liver microsomes were inhibited by ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A activities, and an anti-CYP3A4 antibody. Second, there was a good correlation beteeen CYP3A4 contents and 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation activities in liver microsomes of eighteen human samples examined. Finally, of 10 recombinant human P450 enzymes examined, CYP3A4 had the highest activity for 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation. 3. Liver microsomal 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation activities were induced in rat by pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile and dexamethasone and extensively inhibited by ketoconazole, indicative of the possible roles of CYP3A enzymes in this reaction. 4. Kinetic analysis showed that Vmax/Km for 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation catalysed by liver microsomes was higher in a human sample HL-104 (4.6 microM(-1) min(-1)) than those of rat treated with pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (0.49 microM(-1) min(-1)) and dexamethasone (0.36 microM(-1) min(-1)). 5. 1,8-Cineole, a structurally related monoterpene previously shown to be catalysed by CYP3A enzymes, inhibited 1,4-cineole 2-hydroxylation catalysed by human liver microsomes, whereas 1,4-cineole did not inhibit 1,8-cineole 2-hydroxylation activities. Both compounds caused inhibition of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes, the former compound being more inhibitory than the latter. 6. These results suggest that 1,4-cineole and 1,8-cineole, two plant essential oils present in Citrus medica L. var. acida and Eucalyptus polybractea, respectively, are converted to 2-hydroxylated products by CYP3A enzymes in rat and human liver microsomes. It is unknown at present whether the 2-hydroxylation products of these compounds are more active biologically than the parent compound."
2013,23561154,Effects of NaCl and pH on the structural conformations of kidney bean vicilin.,"Structural changes as a result of variations in pH value and salt concentration were determined for purified vicilin, the major globular protein in kidney beans using intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD). The vicilin consisted of two polypeptide chains of about 43 and 45 kDa in size when analysed under reducing SDS-PAGE. Amino acid analysis showed that the vicilin had high contents of acidic amino acids and a low lysine/arginine ratio. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed to measure exposure of tyrosine and tryptophan as a means of estimating protein conformational changes. Generally, the vicilin showed an unfolded structure at pH 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 as evident by the extensive red shift (>350 nm) of the wavelength of maximum tryptophan fluorescence intensity. At pH 3.0 and 5.0, the fluorescence intensity (FI) was greater than values obtained at pH 7.0 and 9.0, which suggests that the microenvironment of tryptophan was less hydrophilic at acidic pH. Addition of NaCl also led to increased FI, an indication of structural changes of tryptophan in response to the hydrophilic environment. These changes in FI were due mostly to tryptophan emission because tyrosine emission (at 303 nm) was suppressed. The far-UV CD spectra showed that vicilin had minimal measurable secondary structures at pH 3.0 and 5.0 when compared to pH 7.0 and 9.0. Addition of NaCl led to an increase in the tertiary structure conformation of vicilin as determined from the near-UV CD spectra."
2017,27984208,Oral administration of grape seed polyphenol extract restores memory deficits in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats.,"Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been recognized as an important cause of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the two most prominent neurodegenerative diseases causing memory impairment in the elderly. However, an effective therapy for CCH-induced memory impairment has not yet been established. Grape seed polyphenol extract (GSPE) has powerful antioxidant properties and protects neurons and glia during ischemic injury, but its potential use in the prevention of CCH-induced memory impairment has not yet been investigated. Here, CCH-related memory impairment was modeled in rats using permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery. A Morris water maze task was used to evaluate memory, the levels of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholine were used to evaluate cholinergic function, and oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malonic dialdehyde, and catalase. We found that oral administration of GSPE for 1 month can rescue memory deficits. We also found that GSPE restores cholinergic neuronal function and represses oxidative damage in the hippocampus of CCH rats. We propose that GSPE protects memory in CCH rats by reducing ischemia-induced oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction. These findings provide a novel application of GSPE in CCH-related memory impairments."
2019,31029887,Tomato lectin-modified nanoemulsion-encapsulated MAGE1-HSP70/SEA complex protein vaccine: Targeting intestinal M cells following peroral administration.,"Vaccines administered orally enable the stimulation of both the mucous membrane and system immune responses. However, tumor vaccines, whose effective elements are antigen protein molecules or gene-encoding antigens, are hardly accustomed to the harsh gastrointestinal environment. Here, we explored an oral nanoecapsulated tumor vaccine complex to evaluate the anti-tumor effect. Tomato lectin (TL) was modified on the surface of a nanoemulsion (NE) composed of MAGE1-HSP70/SEA (MHS). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with NE (-), NE (MHS) and TL-NE (MHS) via po. or sc. administration. Additionally, the cellular immunocompetence was detected by the enzyme-linked immunospot assay and lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Serum antibody titers were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. Next, the therapeutic and tumor challenge assays were performed. The TL-NE (MHS) particles were 20 ± 5 nm in diameter and could resist pepsin and trypsin digestion. The cellular immune responses elicited by TL-NE (MHS) perioral were stronger than those by TL-NE (MHS)-sc. (p < 0.05) when targeted to B16-MAGE1 tumor cells. The levels of MAGE-1 antibody induced by TL-NE (MHS) via the oral route was higher than control group (p < 0.05). The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in TL-NE (MHS)-po. group was more than other groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, oral TL-NE (M)HScould delay tumor growth and defer tumor occurrence and tumor recurrence after resection in mice challenged with B16-MAGE-1 tumor cells. The study suggested that the oral TL-NE (MHS) vaccine delivery system is feasible to improve the vaccine protection effect and may have broad application in cancer therapy."
2014,24619507,Silver nanoparticles induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and alteration of antioxidant systems in the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza.,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used commercially because of their antibacterial properties. Oxidative stress is known to be involved in the toxicity of AgNPs to bacteria, animals, and algae. The authors used Spirodela polyrhiza to investigate whether AgNPs can induce oxidative stress in higher plants. Results showed that there was a dose-dependent increase in levels of reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity, and the antioxidant glutathione content in 6-nm AgNP treatments. Catalase activity and malondialdehyde content in 6-nm AgNP treatments was significantly higher than the control at silver concentrations of 5 mg L(-1) . Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity and antioxidant glutathione and malondialdehyde content were not significantly different at 10 mg L(-1) of AgNPs (6 nm and 20 nm). Treatment with 20 µg L(-1) Ag(+) (the amount almost equal to 10 mg L(-1) AgNPs released) did not change the reactive oxygen species level or antioxidant enzymes activity. Micron-sized Ag particles had no effect on S. polyrhiza. Transmission electron microscopy showed that, compared with the control, chloroplasts in S. polyrhiza treated with 6-nm and 20-nm AgNPs accumulated starch grains and had reduced intergranal thylakoids. These results clearly indicate that AgNPs are able to cause oxidative stress and affect the chloroplast structure and function of S. polyrhiza, and this effect was not caused by Ag(+) released from particles."
2004,15272606,[Investigation of pesticide residues in foods distributed in Kitakyushu City].,"We investigated 160 kinds of pesticide residues in 715 samples of 116 kinds of foods distributed in Kitakyushu city. Sixty kinds of pesticides were detected in 55 kinds of foods (204 samples) in the range of 0.002-22 mg/kg. Five kinds of pesticides in 7 samples violated the residue standards and the indication of ""unused"". The detection ratios of unregulated pesticide in domestic and imported foods were 27.8 and 33.0%, respectively. Iprodione, dicofol, diethofencarb, procymidone and chlorfenapyr (for domestic food) and total bromine, benomyl, chlorpyrifos, dicofol, fenvalerate, cypermethrin and dimethoate (for imported food) showed relatively high detection ratios. Chinese cabbage, garland chrysanthemum, tomatoes and green teas (domestic) and broccoli, bananas, grapefruit, lemons, oranges, frozen edamame and frozen kidney beans (imported) showed high relative pesticide detection ratios. Residual pesticides were detected with relatively high frequency in imported fruits, imported frozen foods and imported processed foods."
1994,8179735,Efficiency of whole bowel irrigation with and without metoclopramide pretreatment.,"Whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with a polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS) is a gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination procedure used after selected ingestions of toxic substances. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of WBI, with and without metoclopramide pretreatment, to clear the GI tract of foreign bodies using previously established WBI end points, ie, the presence of a clear effluent or the administration of 2 L/h PEG-ELS for 5 hours. Eleven healthy, adult, male volunteers participated in this controlled, two-phase, blinded, crossover study. Ten fluorescent coffee beans were ingested after an overnight fast followed 1 hour later by 10 mg of metoclopramide syrup or an equivalent volume of placebo; 30 minutes later, WBI with PEG-ELS was begun at 2 L/h. All volunteers received 10 L of PEG-ELS during a 5-hour period. No statistically significant difference (P > .05) was found between the two pretreatments. For the metoclopramide group, the mean number of beans passed was equal to 3.8 (+/- 2.5 standard deviation [SD]; 1 to 8 R); the mean number at clear effluent was equal to 2.3. For the placebo group, the mean number of beans passed was equal to 3.5 (+/- 1.9 SD; 2 to 7 R), and the mean number at clear effluent was equal to 2.3. In conclusion, the presence of a clear effluent or the administration of 10 L of PEG-ELS are not valid markers for the termination of WBI if complete elimination of a foreign body is required. Pretreatment with 10 mg of oral metoclopramide does not enhance the efficiency of WBI."
2013,23578649,"Investigation on the role of Spirulina platensis in ameliorating behavioural changes, thyroid dysfunction and oxidative stress in offspring of pregnant rats exposed to fluoride.","The study investigated the role of Spirulina platensis in reversing sodium fluoride-induced thyroid, neurodevelopment and oxidative alterations in offspring of pregnant rats. The total antioxidant activity, phycocyanins, and β carotene content were quantified in Spirulina. Thirty female pregnant rats were allocated to six groups and treatment initiated orally from embryonic day (ED) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 15. Treatment groups included control, Spirulina alone, sodium fluoride (20 mg/kg) alone, and sodium fluoride along with Spirulina (250 and 500 mg/kg). Serum fluoride levels were determined on ED 20 and PND 11. Offspring were subjected to behavioural testing, estimation of thyroid levels, oxidative measurements in brain mitochondrial fraction and histological evaluation of the cerebellum. Fluoride-induced alterations in thyroid hormones, behaviour and increased oxidative stress. Spirulina augmented the displacement of fluoride, facilitated antioxidant formation, improved behaviour and protected Purkinje cells. Supplementing Spirulina during pregnancy could reduce the risk of fluoride toxicity in offspring."
1999,10468686,The effects on intragastric acidity of per-gastrostomy administration of an alkaline suspension of omeprazole.,"It may be difficult to administer proton pump inhibitors via gastrostomy. Previous studies have examined the effect of intact proton pump inhibitor granules in orange juice. This study examined the effect of an alkaline suspension of omeprazole (simplified omeprazole suspension (SOS)) on 24-h intragastric acidity.Six men with an established gastrostomy had a baseline 24-h intragastric pH study using methodology we have previously described. They then received 20 mg SOS o.d. for 7 days and had a repeat pH study at the end of this period. Four of the patients then received 20 mg SOS with 30 cc of liquid antacid (Mylanta) per gastrostomy o.d. for a further 7 days and then underwent a third pH study.SOS raised mean pH from 2.2 to 4.1. Intragastric pH was above 3, 4 and 5 for 35, 28 and 17% of the 24-h period at baseline, respectively; corresponding values after SOS were 63, 51 and 39%, respectively. Addition of liquid antacid to SOS did not further increase its pH-controlling effect.We found a statistically significant effect of o.d. SOS on intragastric pH when administered via gastrostomy. We found no additional benefit of administering SOS with liquid antacid."
2013,22264205,Investigation of antimutagenic potential of Foeniculum vulgare essential oil on cyclophosphamide induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress in mice.,"The present study investigated the protective effects of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) essential oil (FEO) against genotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CP). Mice bone marrow chromosomal aberration (CA), micronucleus, and sperm abnormality assays were employed to measure genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver were also investigated spectrophotometrically. Animals were administered two different doses of FEO (1 and 2 mL/kg) continuously for 3 days at intervals of 24 hours by the oral route before tissue sampling. The results showed that CP produced a significant increase in the average percentage of aberrant metaphases and CAs, excluding gap and micronuclei formation in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), produced cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow cells, and induced abnormal sperms in the male germ line. CP also markedly inhibited the activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH and increased MDA content. Pretreatments with FEO significantly inhibited the frequencies of aberrant metaphases, CAs, micronuclei formation, and cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow cells induced by CP and also produced a significant reduction of abnormal sperm and antagonized the reduction of CP-induced SOD, CAT, and GSH activities and inhibited increased MDA content in the liver. FEO inhibits genotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by CP."
2019,31199702,In Vitro Anticollagenase and Antielastase Activities of Essential Oil of Helichrysum italicum subsp. italicum (Roth) G. Don.,"The chemical composition of the essential oil of flowering aerial parts of Helichrysum italicum subsp. italicum cultivated in central Italy, Marche region, was analyzed by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Seventy-eight components, accounting for 98.71% of the whole essential oil composition, were identified and quantified. Neryl acetate showed the largest relative abundance in the composition, accounting for 15.75% of the oil, followed by α-pinene (8.21%); 4,6,9-trimethyl-8-decene-3,5-dione, (Italidione I), (7.34%); ar-curcumene and β-selinene (5.37%); γ-curcumene (4.83%); nerol (4.75%); α-selinene (4.68%); limonene (4.55%); linalool (4.42%), and 2,4,6,9-tetramethyl-8-decene-3,5-dione (Italidione II), (4.26%). The oil inhibited in vitro collagenase and elastase activities, with IC50 values of 36.99 ± 1.52 and 135.43 ± 6.32 μg/mL, respectively. Neryl acetate, nerol, and linalool, distinctive compounds of the oil obtained from this plant, tested alone or in mixture, at the same percentages shown in the essential oil, exhibited no activity against the two enzymes. On the contrary, α-pinene and limonene, tested alone and in mixture, showed inhibitory activity on both collagenase and elastase."
2014,25315686,Comparing the rehydration potential of different milk-based drinks to a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage.,"The aim of this study was to compare the rehydration potential of a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage with several varieties of milk following exercise-induced fluid losses. Fifteen male participants (age 24.9 ± 5.5 years, height 179.3 ± 4.9 cm, body mass 75.8 ± 6.6 kg (mean ± SD)) lost 2.0% ± 0.2% body mass through intermittent cycling before consuming a different beverage on 4 separate occasions. Drinks included cow's milk (286 kJ·100 mL(-1)), soy milk (273 kJ·100 mL(-1)), a milk-based liquid meal supplement (Sustagen Sport (Nestle); 417 kJ·100 mL(-1)), and a sports drink (Powerade (Coca Cola Ltd); 129 kJ·100 mL(-1)). Beverages were consumed over 1 h in volumes equivalent to 150% of body mass loss. Body mass, blood and urine samples, and measures of gastrointestinal tolerance were obtained before and hourly for 4 h after beverage consumption. Net body mass at the conclusion of each trial was significantly less with Powerade (-1.37 ± 0.3 kg) than with cow's milk (-0.92 ± 0.48 kg), soy milk (-0.78 ± 0.37 kg), and Sustagen Sport (-0.48 ± 0.39 kg). Net body mass was also significantly greater for Sustagen Sport compared with cow's milk trials, but not soy milk. Upon completion of trials, the percentage of beverage retained was Sustagen Sport 65.1% ± 14.7%, soy milk 46.9% ± 19.9%, cow's milk 40.0% ± 24.9%, and Powerade 16.6% ± 16.5%. Changes in plasma volume and electrolytes were unaffected by drink treatment. Subjective ratings of bloating and fullness were higher during all milk trials compared with Powerade whereas ratings of overall thirst were not different between beverages. Milk-based drinks are more effective rehydration options compared with traditional sports drinks. The additional energy, protein, and sodium in a milk-based liquid meal supplement facilitate superior fluid recovery following exercise. "
2011,21977912,Chlorogenic acid differentially affects postprandial glucose and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response in rats.,"Regular coffee consumption significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Coffee contains thousands of compounds; however, the specific component(s) responsible for this reduced risk is unknown. Chlorogenic acids (CGA) found in brewed coffee inhibit intestinal glucose uptake in vitro. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which CGA acts to mediate blood glucose response in vivo. Conscious, unrestrained, male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically catheterized and gavage-fed a standardized meal (59% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 12% protein), administered with or without CGA (120 mg·kg(-1)), in a randomized crossover design separated by a 3-day washout period. Acetaminophen was co-administered to assess the effects of CGA on gastric emptying. The incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) were measured. GLP-1 response in the presence of glucose and CGA was further examined, using the human colon cell line NCI-H716. Total area under the curve (AUC) for blood glucose was significantly attenuated in rats fed CGA (p < 0.05). Despite this, no differences in plasma insulin or nonesterified fatty acids were observed, and gastric emptying was not altered. Plasma GIP response was blunted in rats fed CGA, with a lower peak concentration and AUC up to 180 min postprandially (p < 0.05). There were no changes in GLP-1 secretion in either the in vivo or in vitro study. In conclusion, CGA treatment resulted in beneficial effects on blood glucose response, with alterations seen in GIP concentrations. Given the widespread consumption and availability of coffee, CGA may be a viable prevention tool for T2D."
1998,9667077,Contribution of human hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms to regioselective hydroxylation of steroid hormones.,"1. Hydroxylation activities toward steroid hormones were determined for eleven forms of human hepatic cytochrome P450s expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Microsomes were prepared from the yeast cells and assayed for their regioselectivity of hydroxylation toward progesterone, pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and oestrone. 2. 6 beta-Hydroxylation of progesterone was catalysed most efficiently by CYP3A4, followed by CYP2D6. CYP3A4 showed the highest progesterone 16 alpha-hydroxylation activity, followed by CYP1A1 and CYP2D6. 16 alpha-Hydroxylation of pregnenolone was catalysed efficiently by CYP1A1 and CYP3A4. Only CYP3A4 exhibited 16 alpha-hydroxylase activities toward DHEA and oestrone. 3. Addition of nifedipine, a typical substrate of CYP3A4, inhibited the 6 beta- and 16 alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone by CYP3A4. 4. These results suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 are responsible for the hydroxylation of these endogenous steroids, as well as xenobiotics, in human liver."
2017,29166288,Spirulina Platensis Affects Factors Involved in Spermatogenesis and Increases Ghrelin Receptors in Testis Tissue of Rats Fed a High-Fat Diet.,"Ghrelin is a peptide hormone which plays important role in maintaining growth hormone release and energy homeostasis in vertebrates. Spirulina platensis (SP) has antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects due to its ingredients. In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of SP on the testicular structure and relation between ghrelin and testosterone in the testis of rats fed a high fat diet (HFD). Sixty four young adult male rats were used and divided to 8 equal groups. Experimental groups received addition of 10% cholesterol (CHL), 43% hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) and 3% SP alone or in combination to basal diet while the control group received only basal diet. Serum ghrelin and testosterone levels were measured with ELISA. Receptors for ghrelin and androgen were detected with immunohistochemistry. For histomorphometric investigation, tubulus seminiferus, intertubular area, tubulus seminiferus lumen, Leydig cell nucleus, Sertoli cell nucleus, germ cell nucleus, spermatocyte nucleus and elongated spermatid volume densities were determined stereologically. Serum ghrelin level was increased especially in HVO and CHL combination group compared to the control while serum ghrelin levels were close to control levels in SP-received groups. Ghrelin receptor level was increased in tubulus seminiferus with HVO+CHL administration but this effect was, however, limited in HVO+CHL and SP challenged groups. HVO+CHL administration caused a significant decrease in Leydig cell nucleus volume density, as well as in all SP-received groups, compared to the control. Significantly increased spermatocyte nucleus volume density in cholesterol-receiving groups was decreased to control level with SP alone and its combinations."
2001,11518563,Effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) and quercetin on lipopolysaccharide-induced release of nitric oxide.,"Administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to laboratory animals and cultured macrophages is known to induce the production of nitric oxide (NO) from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Here we show that pre-treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) suppresses the in vivo production of NO (measured by the Griess reaction) after challenge with LPS. In order to begin to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we evaluated in vitro effects of EGb 761 and its flavonoid component, quercetin, on LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Pre-treatment with EGb 761 or quercetin dose-dependently inhibited NO release. Both substances scavenged NO generated from the decomposition of sodium nitroprusside. Western analysis showed that EGb 761 and quercetin inhibited LPS-induced levels of iNOS protein. Northern blotting demonstrated that EGb 761 and quercetin decreased LPS-induced iNOS mRNA levels without altering the half-life. Activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are key events in the signal transduction pathways mediating iNOS induction. In our studies, both EGb 761 and quercetin inhibited p38 MAPK activity, which is necessary for iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, differences in the response of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and Jun N-terminal kinase/stress activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and its downstream substrates to EGb 761 and quercetin suggest that quercetin is not the sole component responsible for the in vivo inhibition of LPS-induced iNOS activation by EGb 761."
2011,22403867,"Anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities of Linum usitatissimum L. (flaxseed/linseed) fixed oil.","The fixed oil of L. usitatissimum (flaxseed/linseed) inhibited PGE2-, leukotriene-, histamine- and bradykinin-induced inflammation. The oil also inhibited arachidonic acid-induced inflammation, suggesting its capacity to inhibit both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonate metabolism. In tail immersion model, the oil raised the pain threshold to a lesser extent than morphine but showed excellent peripherally acting, analgesic activity comparable to aspirin, against acetic acid-induced writhing in mouse. In typhoid paratyphoid A/B vaccine-induced pyrexia, the oil showed antipyretic activity comparable to aspirin. The oil contains 57.38% alpha-linolenic acid. Dual inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism, antihistaminic and antibradykinin activities of the oil could account for the biological activity and the active principle could be alpha-linolenic acid an omega-3 (18:3, n-3) fatty acid."
2011,21814135,"Salvinorin B derivatives, EOM-Sal B and MOM-Sal B, produce stimulus generalization in male Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate salvinorin A.","Salvinorin A, the main active component of Salvia divinorum, is a potent and selective κ opioid receptor agonist. Synthetic derivatives of this substance may be useful in the development of medicinal treatments for pain, mood disorders, and drug dependence. Such developments require extensive preclinical screening of these compounds. The drug discrimination assay is a valuable method for exploring potential similarities between novel compounds and known drugs of abuse with respect to their interoceptive stimulus properties, and can be used to investigate the potency of salvinorin A and its derivatives in vivo. This study used drug discrimination methods to compare two synthetic derivatives of salvinorin B, the ethoxymethyl ether (EOM-Sal B) and methoxymethyl ether (MOM-Sal B) with salvinorin A. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 2.0 mg/kg of salvinorin A from its vehicle (75% dimethylsulfoxide/25% water) in a fixed ratio 20 food-reinforced drug discrimination procedure, and were tested for stimulus generalization with EOM-Sal B and MOM-Sal B. For comparison, substitution tests were also conducted with a μ agonist, morphine, a dissociative hallucinogen, ketamine, and two serotonergic hallucinogens, D-lysergic diethylamide (LSD) and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane. Time-course tests were also conducted with salvinorin A and EOM-Sal B. Both EOM-Sal B and MOM-Sal B substituted fully for salvinorin A and displayed greater potency than salvinorin A. EOM-Sal B was discriminated at longer postinjection intervals than salvinorin A. Morphine and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane failed to substitute for salvinorin A, although ketamine and LSD produced significant drug-appropriate responding. The current findings are consistent with previous reports that salvinorin A produces detectable stimulus effects that are distinct from those of other drug classes and, for the first time, establish that synthetic derivatives of this substance produce similar discriminative stimulus effects. The unexpected partial substitution with LSD and ketamine indicate that further preclinical studies of these novel κ opioid receptor agonists may be warranted."
2009,19881294,Differential effect of resveratrol on nitric oxide production in endothelial f-2 cells.,"We examined the rapid effect of resveratrol on nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial F-2 cells. During an incubation period of 10 min, resveratrol at low concentrations (<20 microM) had no effect on NO production, whereas it significantly increased NO production at high concentrations (>50 microM). In contrast, pretreatment with resveratrol at low concentrations caused a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated NO production. Resveratrol failed to induce phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and VEGF receptor and did not affect autophosphorylation of the VEGF receptor. However, resveratrol markedly suppressed VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Resveratrol at high concentrations reduced the viability of F-2 cells as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and dye exclusion methods. Resveratrol-stimulated NO production was completely abolished by the depletion of extracellular Ca2+. These results indicate that resveratrol stimulates NO production by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism and reduces VEGF-stimulated NO production by impairing a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism in endothelial F-2 cells. However, the stimulatory effect of resveratrol may be partly attributed to its cytotoxicity."
2015,25370610,Acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase inhibitory activities of the edible brown alga Eisenia bicyclis.,"As part of our ongoing isolation of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors from natural marine sources, the bioactivity of the ethanolic extracts from 12 Korean seaweeds were screened for their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Eisenia bicyclis exhibited promising inhibitory properties against AChE, BChE and total ROS with inhibition percentages (%) of 68.01 ± 1.37, 95.72 ± 3.80, and 73.20 ± 1.82 at concentrations of 25 µg/mL, respectively. Among the different solvent-soluble fractions obtained from the ethanolic extract, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction was found to cause the most potent scavenging, or inhibitory activities, against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and total ROS with the respective IC50 values of 2.48 ± 0.01, 8.70 ± 0.06, and 0.81 ± 0.03 µg/mL. Likewise, the EtOAc fraction also exhibited potent inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 2.78 ± 0.07 and 3.48 ± 0.32 µg/mL, respectively. Silica gel column chromatography of the EtOAc fraction yielded a phlorotannin, 974-B, based on the comparison with reported (1)H- and (13)C-NMR spectroscopic data. 974-B showed strong scavenging/or inhibitory potential against DPPH, ONOO(-), total ROS, AChE, and BChE with the respective IC50 values of 0.86 ± 0.02, 1.80 ± 0.01, 6.45 ± 0.04, 1.95 ± 0.01, and 3.26 ± 0.08 µM, respectively. These results indicate that the potential of E. bicyclis and its phlorotannin for use in the development of therapeutic or preventive agents of Alzheimer's disease mainly through ChE inhibition and additional antioxidant capacities."
2015,25690517,Effect of Excessive Potassium Iodide on Rat Aorta Endothelial Cells.,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of excess iodine on rat aorta endothelial cells and the potential underlying mechanisms. Rat aorta endothelial cells were cultured with iodide ion (3506, 4076, 4647, 5218, 5789, 6360, 6931, and 7512 mg/L) for 48 h. Morphological changes of cells were observed with microscope after Wright-Giemsa staining and acridine orange staining. Cell proliferation was determined with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and protein carbonyl in culture medium were determined with colorimetric method. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that excess iodine induced abnormal morphologic changes of cells, inhibited cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis rate. Iodine also reduced the activity of SOD, GSH-Px, and concentrations of GSH and increased the concentrations of MDA and protein carbonyl in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, excess iodine decreased the activity of eNOS and increased the activity of iNOS and the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in culture medium. Our results suggested that excess iodine exposure increased oxidative stress, caused damage of vascular endothelial cells, and altered the expression of adhesion factors and the activity of NOS. These changes may explain the mechanisms underlying excess iodine-induced vascular injury. "
1992,1510321,Effect of estradiol-17 beta treatment of gilts on blood mononuclear cell functions in vitro.,"Porcine blood mononuclear cells (BMC) were exposed to prepartum concentration of estrogen in gilts before acquisition (in vivo), and their subsequent reactivity (in vitro) was explored. In a cross-over experimental designed study, 6 ovariectomized gilts were injected once with 3.75 mg of estradiol-17 beta benzoate in arachidic oil or with arachidic oil only during 2 experiments. The ability of their BMC to proliferate in response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitrogen was assayed in cultures of blood and in cultures of purified BMC. After 2 days of mitogen stimulation, activity of accessible interleukin 2 was quantified in supernatants obtained from cultures of purified BMC and supernatants of blood cultures stimulated with pokeweed mitogen. Also, production of immunoglobulins by purified BMC in response to polyclonal stimuli was measured. Three days after treatment with estradiol, the proliferative response was suppressed in blood cultures stimulated with concanavalin A (P less than 0.05) and phytohemagglutinin (P less than 0.07). Effects of estradiol treatment were not found in any of the assays performed with purified BMC. We, therefore, assumed that in vivo exposure to estradiol can affect the function of porcine BMC; however, this was only evident when the in vitro assays were performed on blood cultures."
2007,17507317,"Use of ceric ammonium sulphate and two dyes, methyl orange and indigo carmine, in the determination of lansoprazole in pharmaceuticals.","Two spectrophotometric methods are proposed for the assay of lansoprazole (LPZ) in bulk drug and in dosage forms using ceric ammonium sulphate (CAS) and two dyes, methyl orange and indigo carmine, as reagents. The methods involve addition of a known excess of CAS to LPZ in acid medium, followed by determination of residual CAS by reacting with a fixed amount of either methyl orange, measuring the absorbance at 520 nm (method A), or indigo carmine, measuring the absorbance at 610 nm (method B). In both methods, the amount of CAS reacted corresponds to the amount of LPZ and the measured absorbance was found to increase linearly with the concentration of LPZ, which is corroborated by the correlation coefficients of 0.9979 and 0.9954 for methods A and B, respectively. The systems obey Beer's law for 0.5-7.0 microg mL(-1) and 0.25-3.0 microg mL(-1) for methods A and B, respectively. The apparent molar absorptivities were calculated to be 3.0 x 10(4) and 4.4 x 10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1) for methods A and B, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated to be 0.08 and 0.25 microg mL(-1) for method A, and 0.09 and 0.27 microg mLs(-1) for method B, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy of the methods were evaluated according to the current ICH guidelines. Both methods were of comparable accuracy (er < or = 2 %). Also, both methods are equally precise as shown by the relative standard deviation values < 1.5%. No interference was observed from common pharmaceutical adjuvants. The accuracy of the methods was further ascertained by performing recovery studies using the standard addition method. The methods were successfully applied to the assay of LPZ in capsule preparations and the results were statistically compared with those of the literature UV-spectrophotometric method by applying Student's t-test and F-test."
2019,31152928,Lycium barbarum polysaccharides attenuate rat anti-Thy-1 glomerulonephritis through mediating pyruvate dehydrogenase.,"Glomerulonephritis is the major cause of chronic kidney disease characterized by mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) on anti-Thy 1 nephritis rats and explore the protective mechanism of LBPs. After the model of glomerulonephritis created by injecting anti-thymocyte serum (ATS), rats were treated with enalapril or LBPs for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by detection of renal-related biochemical parameters, histological observation and markers of renal fibrosis. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis and experiments in vitro were employed to explore the signaling pathway involved in LBPs treatment. The results found that LBPs treatment significantly suppressed ATS-caused increment at levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, proteinuria, PAI-1 protein expression, glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix hyperplasia, along with reduction of creatinine clearance. RNA sequencing showed pyruvate metabolism acting as a potential signaling pathway, which was evidenced by the inhibitory effect on up-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and PAI-1 levels via treatment with LBPs in vitro. LBPs are the promising agents for the management of glomerulonephritis through pyruvate metabolism signaling pathway."
2012,22447248,"Antioxidant and prooxidant effects of lanthanum ions on Vicia faba L. seedlings under cadmium stress, suggesting ecological risk.","The present study combined chemical analyses and biological measurements to investigate biphasic effects of La on Cd stress in leaves of Vicia faba seedlings, which were hydroponically cultivated for 15 d in the combination of 6 µM CdCl(2) and 2 to 480 µM La(NO(3))(3), respectively. The results showed that contents of Cd first elevated above and then declined below the 6 µM single Cd treatment when 2 to 30 µM extraneous La were combined. Contents of mineral nutrients altered differentially and became imbalanced. No distinct band was observed in catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), or ascorbate peroxidase (APX) patterns, but in superoxide dismutase (SOD) isozymes by the supplementation with 8 to 480 µM of extraneous La. Superoxide dismutase and APX activities changed as a U-shaped curve; however, CAT and GPX changed as an inverted U-shaped curve along with increasing La. Moreover, heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) production was reduced below the single treatment of Cd at 2 to 8 µM of extraneous La and enhanced thereafter. Thus, La at lower concentrations promoted antioxidation against Cd stress; La at higher concentrations turned to prooxidant effects, implicating potential ecological risk. Heat shock protein 70, combined with the antioxidant enzymes, constitutes an integrative defense system, which can be used to estimate the degree of antioxidation or prooxidation of extraneous La to Cd-induced oxidative stress in the seedlings."
2013,23411264,Molecular and functional properties of gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket as affected by extracting temperatures.,"Gelatins extracted from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket at different temperatures (45, 55, 65 and 75°C) in the presence and the absence of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 100 units/g pretreated skin) for 12h were characterised. In general, the addition of SBTI resulted in the lower yield, regardless of extraction temperature. Higher yield was obtained when higher extraction temperature was used (P<0.05). Gelatin from skin extracted at 75°C in the absence of SBTI showed the highest yield (10.66 ± 0.41%) (based on dry weight). The highest α-amino group content was observed in gelatin extracted at 55°C without SBTI incorporated. The band intensity of β-chain and α-chains increased as the extraction temperature increased, particularly above 55°C. Gelatin extracted at 65°C with and without SBTI incorporation exhibited the highest gel strength (178.00 ± 7.50 g and 170.47 ± 1.30 g, respectively). FTIR spectra indicated that a greater loss of molecular order of triple helix with a higher degradation was found in gelatin extracted at 55°C in the absence SBTI. Gelatin extracted at 65°C, either with or without SBTI, had the highest EAI and ESI with high foam expansion and stability. Thus, the extraction of gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket at temperature sufficiently high could render the gelatin with less degradation."
1994,27315720,Inhibitory Activity of Podophyllotoxin and Matairesinol-derivative Lignans on the Root Growth of Brassica campestris.,"All the lignans tested in a bioassay with Brassica campestris L. subsp. rapa Hook. fil. et Anders inhibited the root growth of this plant, except for deoxypicropodophyllin. The effects of functional groups in the molecule on the inhibitory activity of these compounds were studied. It is suggested that the methylenedioxyl group and the stereochemical configuration of the lactone junction of podophyllotoxin derivatives were closely related to the inhibitory activity. The O-methyl derivative of two hydroxyl groups of matairesinol greatly enhanced the inhibition of root growth in this plant. "
2020,31475590,Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) leaf extract modulates purinergic and cholinergic enzyme activities in the brain homogenate of 5-fluorouracil administered rats.,"This study investigated the effect of Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) leaf aqueous extract (TE) on purine and acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzyme activities and antioxidant status in the brain of 5-fluorouracil (5-FLU) administered rats. Sixty adult Wistar rats (210-225 g) were divided into Ten groups (n = 6). Group 1: received normal saline orally (NC), group 2, 3, 4 and 5 rats were respectively received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of TE and Vitamin C (25 mg/kg) orally; group 6 rats received normal saline orally and 150 mg/kg of 5-FLU via i.p., on the last day; rats in group 7, 8, 9 and 10 were orally pretreated with 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of TE and Vit C (25 mg/kg) respectively, and administered with 150 mg/kg of 5-FLU i.p., on the last day. The purine [adenosine 5'-tri- and di-phosphatases (ATPase and ADPase), adenosine deaminase (ADA)] nucleotide and acetylcholine hydrolyzing [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butrylcholinesterase (BChE)] enzymes as well as arginase activities and antioxidant status were assessed. The result revealed that untreated 5-FLU rats had increased enzyme activities, which was reduced in the normal rats treated TE compared to NC. Interestingly, the TE-pretreated rats administered with 5-FLU had reduced enzyme activities compared with untreated 5-FLU rats. The antioxidant status was also normalized in the 5-FLU administered rats pretreated with TE Thus, the neuroprotective mechanisms of TE could be linked to attenuation of neuroactive enzymes and antioxidant status."
2014,24996362,Changes in energy metabolism accompanying pitting in blueberries stored at low temperature.,"Low-temperature storage and transport of blueberries is widely practiced in commercial blueberry production. In this research, the storage life of blueberries was extended at low temperature, but fruit stored for 30 d at 0°C pitted after 2d at room-temperature. Fruit cellular structure and physiological parameters accompanying pitting in blueberries were changed. The objective of this research was to characterise properties of energy metabolism accompanying pitting in blueberries during storage, including adenosine phosphates and mitochondrial enzymes involved in stress responses. Physiological and metabolic disorders, changes in cell ultrastructure, energy content and ATPase enzyme activity were observed in pitting blueberries. Energy shortages and increased activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX) were observed in fruit kept at shelf life. The results suggested that sufficient available energy status and a stable enzymatic system in blueberries collectively contribute to improve chilling tolerance, thereby alleviating pitting and maintaining quality of blueberry fruit in long-term cold storage."
2009,19682402,Effects of an onion by-product on bioactivity and safety markers in healthy rats.,"Onions are excellent sources of bioactive compounds including fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and polyphenols. An onion by-product was characterised in order to be developed as a potentially bioactive food ingredient. Our main aim was to investigate whether the potential health and safety effects of this onion by-product were shared by either of two derived fractions, an extract containing the onion FOS and polyphenols and a residue fraction containing mainly cell wall materials. We report here on the effects of feeding these products on markers of potential toxicity, protective enzymes and gut environment in healthy rats. Rats were fed during 4 weeks with a diet containing the products or a control feed balanced in carbohydrate. The onion by-product and the extract caused anaemia as expected in rodents for Allium products. No other toxicity was observed, including genotoxicity. Glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) activities in erythrocytes increased when rats were fed with the onion extract. Hepatic gene expression of Gr, Gpx1, catalase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase was not altered in any group of the onion fed rats. By contrast, gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit gene expression was upregulated but only in rats given the onion residue. The onion by-products as well as the soluble and insoluble fractions had prebiotic effects as evidenced by decreased pH, increased butyrate production and altered gut microbiota enzyme activities. In conclusion, the onion by-products have no in vivo genotoxicity, may support in vivo antioxidative defence and alter the functionality of the rat gut microbiota."
2014,25053558,"Dietary zinc deficiency effects dorso-lateral and ventral prostate of Wistar rats: histological, biochemical and trace element study.","Zinc deficiency has become a global problem affecting the developed and developing countries due to inhibitors in the diet which prevents its absorption or due to a very low concentration of bioavailable zinc in the diet. Being present in high concentration in the prostate and having diverse biological function, we investigated the effects of dietary zinc deficiency for 2 and 4 weeks on dorso-lateral and ventral prostate. Sixty prepubertal rats were divided into three groups: zinc control (ZC), pair fed (PF) and zinc deficient (ZD) and fed on 100 μg/g (zinc control and pair fed groups) and 1 μg/g (zinc deficient) diet. Zinc deficiency was associated with degenerative changes in dorso-lateral and ventral prostate as made evident by karyolysis, karyorhexis, cytoplasmolysis, loss of cellularisation, decreased intraluminar secretion and degeneration of fibromuscular stroma. In response, protein carbonyl, nitric oxide, acid phosphatase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase increased, exhibiting variable level of significance. Total protein and total zinc concentration in dorso-lateral and ventral prostate as well as in serum decreased (P < 0.001). Decrease (P < 0.001) was recorded in serum FSH and testosterone after 2 and 4 weeks of zinc deficiency. The changes were more prominent after 4 weeks of synthetic zinc deficient diet. The results indicate that zinc deficiency during prepubertal period affects the prostate structure, total protein concentration, enhanced protein carbonyl concentration, nitric oxide as well as acid phosphatase activities and impaired hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities. Evidently these changes could be attributed to dysfunction of dorso-lateral and ventral prostate after dietary zinc deficiency as well as impairment of metabolic and secretory activity, reduced gonadotropin levels by hypothalamus -hypophysial system which is indicative of a critical role of zinc in maintaining the prostate integrity."
2017,27890698,Clementine juice has the potential for drug interactions - In vitro comparison with grapefruit and mandarin juice.,"Adverse drug interactions due to grapefruit juice are well known prompting warnings even in drug labels. Similar issues have not been reported for clementines and available data is scarce, despite of genetic descent. We observed substantially increased tacrolimus trough concentrations in a renal transplant patient consuming high clementine amounts and, thus, scrutinised the effects of clementine juice on drug metabolism and drug transporters in vitro and compared it to the effects of mandarin and grapefruit juice. All citrus juices profoundly induced several drug transporters and drug metabolising enzymes, whereas the effects of grapefruit juice were most pronounced (e.g. 156-fold and 34-fold induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 mRNA by grapefruit juice and clementine juice, respectively). However, the juices also inhibited e.g. CYP3A4, raising the question which effect prevails in vivo. Using an enzymatic activity assay, we demonstrated that at least in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition prevails for both grapefruit and clementine juice, whereas for CYP1A2 induction appears to predominate. Thus, inhibition of CYP3A4 is presumably the underlying reason for the observed increase in the concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate tacrolimus in the patient. Taken together, our data indicate that clementine juice as well as grapefruit juice and to a lesser extent also mandarin juice can induce several important drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters, but also inhibit some of these proteins. Our data indicate that clementine juice similar to grapefruit juice bears the potential for profound interactions with drugs potentially leading to adverse drug effects e.g. through over-exposure to CYP3A4 substrates."
2012,22914076,"Cocaine-induced rewarding properties, behavioural sensitization and alteration in social behaviours in group-housed and postpuberty isolated female mandarin voles.","Although it is widely accepted that postweaning housing conditions may affect the behaviour of animals and their responses to drugs, it remains unclear whether analogous effects exist for postpubertal housing conditions. The present study examines the effects of postpubertal housing conditions on cocaine-induced rewarding properties, behavioural sensitization and social behaviour in socially monogamous female mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus). We found that both group-housed and postpuberty isolated females developed conditioned place preferences for cocaine. Isolated females had lower levels of locomotion and sociability as well as higher levels of anxiety and aggressive behaviour compared with group-housed females. In group-housed females, repeated cocaine treatment increased locomotion and reduced social investigation, attack and body-contact behaviour, but enhanced self-grooming. However, for isolated females, this same treatment had no effect on these behaviours. Taken together, these findings indicate that postpubertal housing conditions can affect anxiety-like and social behaviours as well as cocaine-induced behavioural responsiveness in mandarin voles. Group-housed mandarin voles are more sensitive to the effects of cocaine than single-housed voles. The possible mechanisms underlying the effects of different housing on responses to cocaine are discussed."
2017,28514832,Anti-obesity effects of tea from Mangifera indica L. leaves of the Ubá variety in high-fat diet-induced obese rats.,"Due to the high content of bioactive compounds, herbal teas are being investigated as adjuvant in chronic disease management. Studies have shown that mango leaf tea contain mangiferin, total phenolics and antioxidants, compounds with many functional properties. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of tea from Mangifera indica L. leaves, Ubá variety (TML), in obese rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). For this, adult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n=8): the control group (fed AIN-93 diet), obese group (fed a HFD) and treated group (fed a HFD and supplemented with TML for 8 weeks). We analysed biometric measures and serum biochemical parameters of metabolic control, inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers, histomorphometry of visceral adipose tissue and mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PPAR-γ), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). The consumption of TML (24.7±2.1mL/day) exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, increasing total antioxidant capacity and interleukin-10 serum concentrations, reduced abdominal fat accumulation, upregulated PPAR-γ and LPL and downregulated FAS expression. Our data suggest that TML has therapeutic potential in treating obesity and related diseases through regulating the expression of transcriptional factors and enzymes associated with adipogenesis."
2014,23931157,Indicaxanthin inhibits NADPH oxidase (NOX)-1 activation and NF-κB-dependent release of inflammatory mediators and prevents the increase of epithelial permeability in IL-1β-exposed Caco-2 cells.,"Dietary redox-active/antioxidant phytochemicals may help control or mitigate the inflammatory response in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present study, the anti-inflammatory activity of indicaxanthin (Ind), a pigment from the edible fruit of cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica, L.), was shown in an IBD model consisting of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2 cells) stimulated by IL-1β, a cytokine known to play a major role in the initiation and amplification of inflammatory activity in IBD. The exposure of Caco-2 cells to IL-1β brought about the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX-1) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate intracellular signalling leading to the activation of NF-κB, with the over-expression of inflammatory enzymes and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. The co-incubation of the cells with Ind, at a nutritionally relevant concentration (5-25 μM), and IL-1β prevented the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, PGE2 and NO, the formation of ROS and the loss of thiols in a dose-dependent manner. The co-incubation of the cells with Ind and IL-1β also prevented the IL-1β-induced increase of epithelial permeability. It was also shown that the activation of NOX-1 and NF-κB was prevented by Ind and the expression of COX-2 and inducible NO synthase was reduced. The uptake of Ind in Caco-2 cell monolayers appeared to be unaffected by the inflamed state of the cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the dietary pigment Ind may have the potential to modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level."
2013,23838965,"Bilobalide, a unique constituent of Ginkgo biloba, inhibits inflammatory pain in rats.","Standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 has been shown to inhibit inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats; however, the mechanism of action is not known. This study set out to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of bilobalide, a unique G. biloba constituent, in three well-characterized models of acute inflammatory pain. The effect of oral, intraplantar or intrathecal administration of bilobalide or drug-vehicle (0.25% agar; 10% ethanol in H2O) on responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw, and paw oedema were assessed in adult male Wistar rats before and after intradermal hindpaw injection of carrageenan (3%; 50 μl) or capsaicin (10 μg; 50 μl) or after hindpaw incision (n=6-8/group). Oral administration of bilobalide (10-30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited thermal hyperalgesia in response to carrageenan, capsaicin and paw incision, independent of dose, with an efficacy similar to that of diclofenac. In the carrageenan model, mechanical hypersensitivity and paw oedema were also significantly reduced after treatment with bilobalide (10-30 mg/kg). Intrathecal administration of bilobalide (0.5-1 μg) inhibited carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, but had no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity or paw oedema (application≥2 μg induced adverse effects, precluding testing of higher doses). Intraplantar administration of bilobalide (30-100 μg) had no effect. These data show that bilobalide is a potent anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic agent, the therapeutic effects of which are mediated in part through a central site of action, and may account for the therapeutic action of the whole extract G. biloba.

2005,16046213,Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by berberine in HepG2 and H4IIE cells: Biphasic effect on CYP1A1.,"Berberine has long been considered a candidate for an antimalarial drug. It exerts a plethora of biological activities and has been used in the treatment of diarrhea and gastro-enteritis for centuries. Here we provide evidence that berberine activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in human hepatoma (HepG2) and rat hepatoma cells stably transfected with a dioxin responsive element fused to the luciferase gene (H4IIE.luc). AhR was activated by high doses of berberine (10-50 microM) after 6 and 24 h of incubation as revealed by CYP1A1 mRNA expression (HepG2) and AhR-dependent luciferase activity (H4IIE.luc). Berberine induced nuclear translocation of AhR-GFP chimera transiently transfected to Hepa1c1c7 cells. In contrast, low doses of berberine (<1 microM) and prolonged times of the treatments (48 h) failed to produce any activation of AhR in H4IIE.luc cell line. HPLC analysis ruled out the hypothesis that the loss of berberine capacity to activate AhR in H4IIE.luc cells is due to metabolic inactivation of the alkaloid. We demonstrate that berberine is a potent inhibitor (IC50=2.5 microM) of CYP1A1 catalytic activity (EROD) in HepG2 cell culture and in recombinant CYP1A1 protein. Collectively, our results imply that while berberine activates the Ah receptor, it is accompanied by inactivation of the catalytic activity of CYP1A1 and occurs at concentrations that exceed those predicted to occur in vivo. Given these data, it appears that activation of the AhR pathway by berberine has a low toxicological potential."
2018,29452068,"Glycyrrhizin attenuates histamine-mediated MUC5AC upregulation, inflammatory cytokine production, and aquaporin 5 downregulation through suppressing the NF-κB pathway in human nasal epithelial cells.","Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic respiratory inflammatory disease. Glycyrrhizin is a main bioactive component of the licorice root extract and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. However, the role of glycyrrhizin in AR has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizin on histamine-induced human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs). Here, we found that glycyrrhizin (20 or 40 μM) inhibited histamine-induced the mRNA expression and secretion of mucin 5 subtype AC (MUC5AC), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in HNEpCs. The expression levels of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) were decreased by histamine in HNEpCs and increased in cells treated with glycyrrhizin. The glycyrrhizin treatment inhibited histamine-induced expressions of p-NF-κB p65 and p-IκBα in HNEpCs, indicating that glycyrrhizin inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway in histamine-induced HNEpCs. In addition, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway exhibited the similar effect with glycyrrhizin on histamine-induced HNEpCs. In summary, the results showed that glycyrrhizin reversed the effect of histamine on MUC5AC expression, inflammatory cytokine production, and AQP5 expression in HNEpCs, and the NF-κB pathway was involved in the effect. Glycyrrhizin might be used for complementary and alternative therapeutics of AR."
2017,28154251,Hydroxysafflor Yellow A Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Mice.,"Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is an effective ingredient of the Chinese herb Carthamus tinctorius L. The present study investigated the protective effect of HSYA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in mice, and the underlying mechanisms involved. HSYA (14, 28, 56 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected to mice once daily from day 1 to 10 after LPS administration. HSYA attenuated the body weight loss, the augmented left index and the increase of pathologic changes in pulmonary inflammation caused by LPS. Treatment with HSYA also alleviated increased expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, collagen (Col) I, Col III, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), myeloid differentiation (MD)-2, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cluster differentiation (CD)14 at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein levels (Western blot and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay). Moreover, HSYA inhibited the elevated levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and α-SMA in lung tissue (immunohistochemistry), and alleviated the slight collagen deposition in pulmonary tissues (Masson's trichrome staining). HSYA inhibited the specific binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-LPS on human lung epithelial cell line (A549) or human umbilical vein cell line (Eahy926) cells (flow cytometry). These findings suggested that HSYA has a protective effect on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by LPS through blocking the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and that the TLR4 receptor might be a target of HSYA on the cell membrane."
2009,19122290,Effects of panduratin A isolated from Kaempferia pandurata ROXB. on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by porphyromonas gingivalis supernatant-induced KB cells.,"Periodontitis is initiated by accumulation of microbial plaque and activation of gingival inflammation through overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to tissue destruction. Natural MMP inhibitors may be developed as therapeutic agents against periodontitis. In this study, panduratin A, a natural bioactive compound isolated from Kaempferia pandurata ROXB., was used to test its in vitro inhibitory activity against MMP-9 secretion from Porphyromonas gingivalis supernatant-induced human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. Gelatin zymography, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses were performed to evaluate MMP-9 expression. The gelatin zymograms revealed that the main gelatinase secreted by P. gingivalis supernatant-induced KB cells migrated at 92 kDa, representing MMP-9. MMP-9 protein and mRNA levels were significantly decreased after panduratin A treatment (p<0.05). In contrast, panduratin A had no effect on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA. Panduratin A also suppressed urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA expression. These results suggest that panduratin A could potentially prevent periodontal inflammation by decreasing the levels of MMP-9 protein and mRNA."
2005,15731182,Outcomes for reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation for multiple myeloma: an analysis of prognostic factors from the Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of the EBMT.,"We report the outcome of 229 patients who received an allograft for myeloma with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens from 33 centers within the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). The median age was 52 years and 64% were male. Conditioning regimens were heterogeneous, but most were fludarabine based and T cell depleted with antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year was 22%. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 41% and 21%, respectively. Adverse OS was associated with chemoresistant disease (relative risk [RR], 2.9), more than 1 prior transplantation (RR, 2.0), and male patients with female donors (RR, 1.45). Adverse PFS was associated with chemoresistance (RR, 2.4) and alemtuzumab (RR, 1.8). TRM was increased with female-to-male donation (RR, 2.5) and transplantation more than 1 year from diagnosis (RR, 2.3). Grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) occurred in 31%. Chronic GvHD was associated with better OS and PFS and were 84% and 46% for limited, 58% and 30% for extensive, and 29% and 12% in its absence suggesting that a graft-versus-myeloma effect is important. While RIC is feasible, heavily pretreated patients and patients with progressive disease do not benefit."
2012,22980898,Changes in chemical composition and antioxidative properties of rye ginger cakes during their shelf-life.,"Changes in chemical composition and antioxidative properties of rye ginger cakes during their shelf-life were investigated in this study. In particular, the changes in antioxidants content, antioxidative and reducing capacity, and Maillard reaction development in rye ginger cakes after long-term storage were addressed. Ginger cakes produced according to the traditional and current recipe were stored for 5 years at room temperature in a dark place. The total phenolic compounds (TPC), inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), reduced (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) contents, antioxidant and reducing capacity and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) were determined in ginger cakes after storage and then compared to those measured after baking. After long-term storage a decrease in TPC and IP6 contents in cakes was noted. In contrast, an increase in antioxidative and reducing capacity of stored cakes was observed. Long-term storage induced formation of furosine, advanced and final Maillard reaction products and caused changes in both reduced and oxidised forms of glutathione. After long-term storage the modest changes in furosine, FAST index and browning in ginger cake formulated with dark rye flour may suggest that this product is the healthiest among others. Therefore, traditional rye ginger cakes can be considered as an example of a healthy food that is also relatively stable during long term storage as noted by the small chemical changes observed in its composition."
2013,23043278,Cognitive effects of two nutraceuticals Ginseng and Bacopa benchmarked against modafinil: a review and comparison of effect sizes.,"Over recent years there has been increasing research into both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical cognition enhancers. Here we aimed to calculate the effect sizes of positive cognitive effect of the pharmaceutical modafinil in order to benchmark the effect of two widely used nutraceuticals Ginseng and Bacopa (which have consistent acute and chronic cognitive effects, respectively). A search strategy was implemented to capture clinical studies into the neurocognitive effects of modafinil, Ginseng and Bacopa. Studies undertaken on healthy human subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design were included. For each study where appropriate data were included, effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated for measures showing significant positive and negative effects of treatment over placebo. The highest effect sizes for cognitive outcomes were 0.77 for modafinil (visuospatial memory accuracy), 0.86 for Ginseng (simple reaction time) and 0.95 for Bacopa (delayed word recall). These data confirm that neurocognitive enhancement from well characterized nutraceuticals can produce cognition enhancing effects of similar magnitude to those from pharmaceutical interventions. Future research should compare these effects directly in clinical trials."
1991,1674650,Effects of alpha-ketoisocaproate on adrenocorticotropin-induced suppression of lymphocyte function in sheep.,"Previous studies of the amino acid analogue, alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), indicate that it can stimulate lymphocyte blastogenesis and antibody responses of sheep. To determine whether KIC could overcome the effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced lymphocyte suppression, 24 lambs were fed a control diet, a diet supplemented with 0.05% KIC, or a diet supplemented with 0.05% of the parent amino acid leucine. Immune status was monitored by determining lymphocyte blastogenic responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA), concanavalin A (conA), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and percentages of T-cell subsets in the blood, using monoclonal antibodies and a flow cytometer. Serum cortisol, insulin, and glucagon concentrations also were determined. After 60 days of consuming the respective diet, lambs were administered either saline solution or ACTH (100 IU) twice daily for 3 consecutive days. Administration of ACTH increased serum cortisol and insulin concentrations; however, no effects were seen for serum glucagon concentration. Compared with saline administration, ACTH administration significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis by approximately 50%, regardless of the mitogen used, and significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased the percentage of circulating T lymphocytes and decreased (P less than 0.01) the ratio of T4 to T8 cells. Lambs fed KIC had greater PHA- and conA-stimulated blastogenic responses and significantly (P less than 0.05) increased ratio of T4 to T8 cells in the blood, compared with lambs fed the leucine-supplemented diet or the control diet and given corresponding injections. These data indicate that ACTH decreased in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis and altered the subset ratios of blood lymphocytes in sheep. These changes were partially prevented by feeding KIC."
2003,12951502,Enhanced methionine and cysteine levels in transgenic rice seeds by the accumulation of sesame 2S albumin.,"A chimeric gene encoding a precursor polypeptide of sesame 2S albumin, a sulfur-rich seed storage protein, was expressed in transgenic rice plants under the control of the glutelin promoter with the aim of improving the nutritive value of rice. Rice grains harvested from the first generation of ten different transformed lines inherited the transgene, and the accumulated sesame 2S albumin was presumably processed correctly as its mature form in sesame seed. This transgene was specifically expressed in maturing rice seeds with its encoded sesame 2S albumin exclusively accumulated in the seeds. The crude protein content in rice grains from five putative homozygous lines was increased by 0.64-3.54%, and the methionine and cysteine contents of these transgenic rice grains were respectively elevated by 29-76% and 31-75% compared with those of wild-type rice grains."
2011,21597199,Fermented Viola mandshurica inhibits melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells.,"We assessed the effects of chloroform extract of fermented Viola mandshurica (CEFV) on melanogenesis B16 melanoma cells. CEFV treatment significantly decreased melanin content and tyrosinase activity in dose-dependent manners. To elucidate the mechanism of the inhibitory effects of CEFV on melanogenesis, we performed RT-PCR and Western blotting for melanogenesis-related genes such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), TRP-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). CEFV strongly inhibited mRNA as well as the protein expression of tyrosinase and MITF, but had no significant effect on TRP-1 or TRP-2 expressions. It markedly decreased the phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), and induced the duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, leading to reduction of MITF expression and subsequently that of tyrosinase. Therefore, we suggest that CEFV induces downregulation of melanogenesis through decreased CREB phosphorylation and ERK activation."
2012,23107545,Impact of antinutritional factors in food proteins on the digestibility of protein and the bioavailability of amino acids and on protein quality.,"Dietary antinutritional factors have been reported to adversely affect the digestibility of protein, bioavailability of amino acids and protein quality of foods. Published data on these negative effects of major dietary antinutritional factors are summarized in this manuscript. Digestibility and the quality of mixed diets in developing countries are considerably lower than of those in developed regions. For example, the digestibility of protein in traditional diets from developing countries such as India, Guatemala and Brazil is considerably lower compared to that of protein in typical North American diets (54-78 versus 88-94 %). Poor digestibility of protein in the diets of developing countries, which are based on less refined cereals and grain legumes as major sources of protein, is due to the presence of less digestible protein fractions, high levels of insoluble fibre, and/or high concentrations of antinutritional factors present endogenously or formed during processing. Examples of naturally occurring antinutritional factors include glucosinolates in mustard and canola protein products, trypsin inhibitors and haemagglutinins in legumes, tannins in legumes and cereals, gossypol in cottonseed protein products, and uricogenic nucleobases in yeast protein products. Heat/alkaline treatments of protein products may yield Maillard reaction compounds, oxidized forms of sulphur amino acids, D-amino acids and lysinoalanine (LAL, an unnatural nephrotoxic amino acid derivative). Among common food and feed protein products, soyabeans are the most concentrated source of trypsin inhibitors. The presence of high levels of dietary trypsin inhibitors from soyabeans, kidney beans or other grain legumes have been reported to cause substantial reductions in protein and amino acid digestibility (up to 50 %) and protein quality (up to 100 %) in rats and/or pigs. Similarly, the presence of high levels of tannins in sorghum and other cereals, fababean and other grain legumes can cause significant reductions (up to 23 %) in protein and amino acid digestibility in rats, poultry, and pigs. Normally encountered levels of phytates in cereals and legumes can reduce protein and amino acid digestibility by up to 10 %. D-amino acids and LAL formed during alkaline/heat treatment of lactalbumin, casein, soya protein or wheat protein are poorly digestible (less than 40 %), and their presence can reduce protein digestibility by up to 28 % in rats and pigs, and can cause a drastic reduction (100 %) in protein quality, as measured by rat growth methods. The adverse effects of antinutritional factors on protein digestibility and protein quality have been reported to be more pronounced in elderly rats (20-months old) compared to young (5-weeks old) rats, suggesting the use of old rats as a model for assessing the protein digestibility of products intended for the elderly."
2007,17341830,Inhibition of increases in blood glucose and serum neutral fat by Momordica charantia saponin fraction.,"Focusing on a functional component of Momordica charantia, saponin, we investigated its effects on serum glucose and neutral fat levels. Saponin was extracted as a butanol-soluble fraction (saponin fraction) from hot blast-dried Momordica charantia powder. The disaccharidase-inhibitory activity and the pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity of the saponin fraction were measured, and in vivo sugar- and lipid-loading tests were performed. The saponin fraction inhibited disaccharidase activity and elevation of the blood glucose level after sucrose loading. The fraction also markedly inhibited pancreatic lipase activity and elevation of the serum neutral fat level after corn oil loading. Based on these findings, the main active component related to the anti-diabetic effect of Momordica charantia is present in the butanol fraction, and it may be saponin. The blood glucose and serum neutral fat-lowering effects of Momordica charantia were closely associated with its inhibitory activity against disaccharidase and pancreatic lipase."
2018,29699675,"Comparative study on the chemical composition, anthocyanins, tocopherols and carotenoids of selected legumes.","Twenty-nine legumes were assessed for their nutritional and phytochemical compositions. Soybean and black soybean had the highest protein contents (34.05-42.65 g/100 g DW, dry weight of legumes), particularly being a rich source of lysine (1.78-2.23 g/100 g DW. Soybean and black soybean had the highest fat contents (14.13-22.19 g/100 g DW). Broad beans had the highest unsaturated fatty acids (83.57-89.01 g/100 g fatty acid), particularly rich in α-linolenic and linoleic acid. The highest and the lowest dietary fiber were found in red kidney beans (35.36 g/100 g DW) and mung beans (22.77 g/100 g DW), respectively. Except for soybean and white kidney bean, 6 major anthocyanins in the legumes samples were identified. The soybean contained the highest total tocopherols content (90.40-120.96 μg/g dry weight of beans), followed by black soybean (66.13-100.76 μg/g DW). The highest carotenoids were found in lentils (4.53-21.34 μg/g DW) and red kidney beans (8.29-20.95 μg/g DW)."
2016,25720525,Pomegranate juice does not affect the disposition of simvastatin in healthy subjects.,"Previous in vitro and in vivo investigations reported controversial results for the inhibitory potential of pomegranate on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity. This study evaluated the effect of pomegranate juice on the disposition of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, and simvastatin acid, its active metabolite, compared with grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. A single oral pharmacokinetic study of 40 mg simvastatin was conducted as a three-way crossover (control, pomegranate, and grapefruit juices) in 12 healthy male subjects. The subjects took pomegranate or grapefruit juice three times per day for 3 days (900 mL/day) and on the third day, the pharmacokinetic study was executed. Blood samples were collected to 24 h post-dose and the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were compared among the study periods. In the period of grapefruit juice, the mean C max and AUCinf of simvastatin [the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) 15.6 (11.6-21.0) and 9.1 (6.0-13.7)] were increased significantly when compared with the control period, whereas they were not significantly different in the period of pomegranate juice [C max and AUCinf 1.20 (0.89-1.62) and 1.29 (0.85-1.94)]. The mean C max and AUCinf of simvastatin acid were increased significantly after intake of grapefruit juice, but not pomegranate juice. These results suggest that pomegranate juice affects little on the disposition of simvastatin in humans. Pomegranate juice does not seem to have a clinically relevant inhibitory potential on CYP3A4 activity. "
2008,17982500,Ocular surface and tear functions after topical cyclosporine treatment in dry eye patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease.,"We investigated the effect of 0.05% topical cyclosporine (Cys) on the ocular surface and tear functions in dry eye patients with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in a prospective comparative study. Thirty eyes of 15 patients refractory to baseline treatment were recruited and the patients assigned for topical Cys treatment group (14 eyes of 7 patients) and control group (12 eyes of 6 patients) respectively. Two patients dropped out because of intolerable irritation while using topical Cys eye drops. Visual analog scale symptom scores, corneal sensitivity, Schirmer I test value, tear film break-up time (TBUT), tear evaporation rate and ocular surface vital staining scores were recorded at baseline and at the end of the following one month. Conjunctival impression and brush cytology were performed before and after the treatment. After topical Cys treatment, significant improvements were found in symptom scores, corneal sensitivity, tear evaporation rate, TBUT, vital staining scores, goblet cells density, conjunctival squamous metaplasia grade, inflammatory cell numbers and the MUC5AC expression. Our study suggests that 0.05% topical Cys may be an effective treatment for dry eye patients with cGVHD. The improvements in the ocular surface and tear functions resulted presumably from the decreased inflammation, increased goblet cell density and MUC5AC mRNA expression.

1994,8122597,Response of conductance and resistance coronary vessels to scalar concentrations of acetylcholine: assessment with quantitative angiography and intracoronary Doppler echography in 29 patients with coronary artery disease.,"Abnormal vasoreactivity of the large conductance arteries has been observed in the presence of impaired endothelial function. More recently, experimental and clinical reports have shown that in early coronary atherosclerosis the impairment of the endothelium-mediated vasodilatation also involves the resistance arteries. The aim of this study is the correlation of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of conductance and resistance vessels in coronary arteries without significant stenoses. In 29 patients (aged 57 +/- 9 years, 24 men and 5 women) undergoing coronary angioplasty, a Doppler guide wire and a perfusion catheter were introduced into the proximal segment of an artery with less than 30% diameter stenosis. Selective infusions of papaverine (bolus of 7 mg), acetylcholine (continuous infusion of 0.036, 0.36, and 3.6 micrograms/ml at a flow rate of 2 ml/min), and isosorbide dinitrate (bolus of 3 mg) were sequentially performed. Heart rate, aortic blood pressure, and blood flow velocity were continuously measured. Mean cross-sectional areas of a proximal and a distal arterial segment were measured in baseline conditions, at the end of each infusion of acetylcholine, and at the peak effect of isosorbide dinitrate with quantitative angiography (CAAS System; Pie Medical Data, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Coronary blood flow was calculated from the time-averaged flow velocity and the cross-sectional area at the site of the Doppler sample volume. Coronary flow resistance was calculated as mean aortic pressure divided by coronary flow. All of the concentrations of acetylcholine induced a significant vasoconstriction of the studied artery. At the maximal concentration of acetylcholine all but three patients (90%) showed a reduction of cross-sectional area (-24% +/- 20% and -22% +/- 20% for the proximal and distal segments, respectively, p < 0.00001). Flow velocity showed a significant increase only with the two highest concentrations of acetylcholine. The maximal concentration induced a 105% +/- 138% increase from the baseline flow velocity (p < 0.001). The coronary flow changes after acetylcholine showed a large interpatient variability, with a mean increase from baseline after the highest dose of +43% +/- 85% (range, -60% +/- 239%), with the presence of a flow reduction in 10 patients (35%). No clinical or angiographic variables showed a significant correlation with the cross-sectional area, flow velocity, and flow changes after infusion of acetylcholine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2005,15684578,[Relation between oxygen uptake rate and biosorption of activated sludge against chemical substance].,"In this study, the elucidation of the toxicity mechanism was undertaken regarding the IC(50) of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) with relevance to the biosorption as a toxicity evaluation of chemical substances for activated sludge (AS). At the IC(50) of<100 mg/l, malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) were confirmed in the group showing relatively strong OUR inhibition. These dyes were markedly biosorbed by AS in a short time. The biosorption for AS showed a weak tendency in linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS), alkyl ethoxy sulfonate (AES), alpha-olefine sulfonate (AOS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), formaldehyde (FA), benzalkonium chloride (BZaC), benzethonium chloride (BZeC), rhodamine 6G (R-6G) and fuchsine (Fuc) in which the IC(50) belonged to the 100-1000 mg/l group, when it was compared with CV and MG. In ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (PrOH), nile blue (NB), evans blue (EB), methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), paraquat (PQ), chlorophyllin (Chl) and auramine (Aur), the IC(50) was large, and the biosorption of AS was weak at 0-15%. The biosorption of MG for AS followed the adsorption isotherm equation Y=0.002X(0.511) of Freundrich. The correlation coefficient was gamma=0.998 (n=8), and a very high correlation was obtained. In the qualitative OUR curve by AS pretreated with MG or CV which belonged to the IC(50) small group, the inhibition of remarkable OUR was observed. Therefore, the findings of the present investigation suggest that the inhibition of the OUR for AS by the tested chemical substances was markedly affected by the biosorption."
2008,18223305,Nigella sativa oil for prevention of chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity: an experimental model.,"Nephrotoxicity is the main secondary effect of cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. The antioxidant action of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) may explain the protective effect of these agents against various hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic models in vivo and in vitro. This study was designed to investigate the possible protective effects of NSO, in prevention of chronic CsA-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Animals were randomly divided into four experimental groups: the control group received sunflower oil, the other groups were treated with CsA (25 mg/kg/day b.w. orally) or NSO (2 ml/kg orally) or CsA + NSO, respectively. Urine and serum creatinine levels, tissue superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase enzyme activities, and nitric oxide and malondialdehyde levels were measured, and histological examination was performed. In our study, CsA caused a significant deterioration in the renal function, morphology and gave rise to severe oxidative stress in the kidney. NSO significantly improved the functional and histological parameters and attenuated the oxidative stress induced by CsA. In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time that NSO protects kidney tissue against oxygen free radicals, preventing renal dysfunction and morphological abnormalities associated with chronic CsA administration."
2017,28253877,Neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects of the combined extract of Cyperus rotundus and Zingiber officinale.,"Currently, food supplements to improve age-related dementia are required. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of the combined extract of Cyperus rotundus and Zingiber officinale (CP1) on the improvement of age-related dementia in rats with AF64A-induced memory deficits.Male Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were orally given CP1 at doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg.kg-1 BW for a period of 14 days after bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of AF64A. Spatial memory was assessed in all rats every 7 days throughout the 14 day-experimental period. At the end of the study, neuronal density, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress status and the activation of MAPK cascades in the hippocampus were determined.Enhanced memory, increased neuronal density, decreased AChE activity and decreased oxidative stress status together with activated pERK1/2 were observed in the hippocampus of CP1-treated rats. These results suggested that CP1 might improve memory via enhanced cholinergic function and decreased neurodegeneration and oxidative stress.CP1 is a potential novel food supplement for dementia. However, further investigations on the subchronic toxicity of CP1 and drug interactions are required."
2006,16500887,Antioxidant activity measured in different solvent fractions obtained from Mentha spicata Linn.: an analysis by ABTS*+ decolorization assay.,"Antioxidant compounds are abundantly available in plants and play an important role in scavenging free radicals, thus providing protection to humans against oxidative DNA damage. Mentha spicata Linn., commonly called spearmint, belongs to the family lamiaceae. It was selected in the present study because Mentha extracts have antioxidant properties due to the presence of eugenol, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Four solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water) of ethanolic extract of dried leaves powder of M. spicata were analyzed for total antioxidant activity (TAA) and relative antioxidant activity (RAA) and compared with standard antioxidants such as Quercetin, beta-carotene, L-ascorbic acid and glutathione using ABTS*+ decolorization assay (ABTS/Potassium persulphate). The antioxidant activity was assumed to be from the total phenolic content of the ethanolic extract. Total phenolics are found to be highest in ethyl acetate fraction (54 mg/g) and least in hexane fraction (13 mg/g) and more or less similar in water and chloroform fractions (30-32 mg/g). TAA is found to be less in hexane and chloroform fractions (<53% at 50 microg/ml) and highest in ethyl acetate (95% at 20 microg/ml) and water (84% at 30 microg/ml) fractions. The RAA of ethyl acetate fraction is 1.1 compared to quercetin (at 5 microM/ml), but greater when compared to beta-carotene (15 microM/ml), L-ascorbic acid (15 microM/ml) and glutathione (15 microM/ml). The RAAs with these antioxidants are in the range of 1.31 -1.6. The values of RAAs for water fraction also show similar trend and are in the range of 1.0-1.4. The antioxidant activities of the solvent factions are closely related to the content of total phenolics present in them."
2012,22982565,Potent vasodilation effect of amurensin G is mediated through the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has important regulatory functions in vascular tone, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is a key event in diabetes and atherosclerosis. Vitis amurensis grapes containing resveratrol oligomers are consumed as wine and fruit and have antioxidative and neuroprotective effects. In this study, our goal was identify the most potent eNOS-activating compound among six stilbenes and oligostilbenes found in V. amurensis and to clarify its molecular mechanism. Among the six tested compounds, amurensin G most potently relaxed endothelium-intact aortic rings and increased eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production. Amurensin G increased both estrogen receptor (ER) phosphorylation and ER-dependent gene transcription, and ERα or ERβ inhibition suppressed amurensin G-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. Amurensin G enhanced the activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src and their chemical inhibitors suppressed amurensin G-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation. Moreover, amurensin G activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and amurensin G-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and PI3K activation were reversed by AMPK inhibition. ER inhibition reversed AMPK-dependent PI3K activation in response to amurensin G. Amurensin G-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation was blocked by inhibition of AMPK, ER, Src, or PI3K. These results suggest that amurensin G enhances NO production via eNOS phosphorylation in endothelial cells, and ER-dependent AMPK/PI3K pathways are required. Amurensin G would be applicable to prevent atherosclerosis."
2014,23920421,Wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)-enriched diet improves dyslipidaemia and modulates the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in obese Zucker rats.,"The present study investigated the potential of a wild blueberry (WB)-enriched diet to improve blood lipid profile and modulate the expression of genes related to lipid homeostasis in obese Zucker rats (OZR), a model of the metabolic syndrome with severe dyslipidaemia. For this purpose, twenty OZR and twenty lean Zucker rats (LZR; controls) were placed either on a control (C) or an 8 % WB diet for 8 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol and TAG concentrations were determined. The relative expression of six genes involved in lipid metabolism was also determined in both the liver and the abdominal adipose tissue (AAT). Plasma TAG and TC concentrations were significantly lower in the OZR following WB consumption (4228 (sem 471) and 2287 (sem 125) mg/l, respectively) than in those on the C diet (5475 (sem 315) and 2631 (sem 129) mg/l, P< 0·05), while there was no change in HDL-cholesterol concentration. No significant effects were observed for plasma lipids in the LZR. Following WB consumption, the expression of the transcription factors PPARα and PPARγ in the OZR was increased in the AAT, while that of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) was decreased in the liver and AAT. The expression of fatty acid synthase was significantly decreased in both the liver and AAT and that of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 was increased in the AAT following WB consumption. In conclusion, WB consumption appears to improve lipid profiles and modulate the expression of key enzymes and transcription factors of lipid metabolism in severely dyslipidaemic rats. "
2018,29726706,Hibiscus sabdariffa (roselle) polyphenol-rich extract averts cardiac functional and structural abnormalities in type 1 diabetic rats.,"Diabetes mellitus is often associated with cardiac functional and structural alteration, an initial event leading to cardiovascular complications. Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has been widely proven as an antioxidant and recently has incited research interest for its potential in treating cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the cardioprotective effects of H. sabdariffa (roselle) polyphenol-rich extract (HPE) in type-1-induced diabetic rats. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups (n = 6/group): nondiabetic, diabetic alone (DM), diabetic supplemented with HPE (DM+HPE), and diabetic supplemented with metformin. Type-1 diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (55 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Rats were forced-fed with HPE (100 mg/kg) and metformin (150 mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that HPE supplementation improved hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia significantly (p < 0.05) in the DM+HPE compared with the DM group. HPE supplementation attenuated cardiac oxidative damage in the DM group, indicated by low malondialdehyde and advanced oxidation protein product. As for the antioxidant status, HPE significantly (p < 0.05) increased glutathione level, as well as catalase and superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 activities. These findings correlate with cardiac function, whereby left ventricle developed pressure in DM+HPE (79.13 ± 3.08 mm Hg) was higher significantly compared with DM (45.84 ± 1.65 mm Hg). Coronary flow of DM+HPE (17.43 ± 0.62 mL/min) was also greater compared with DM (13.02 ± 0.6 mL/min), showing that HPE supplementation improved cardiac contractility and relaxation rate significantly (p < 0.05). Histological analysis showed a marked decrease in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in DM+HPE compared with the DM group. Ultrastructural changes and impairment of mitochondria induced by diabetes were minimized by HPE supplementation. Collectively, these findings suggest that HPE is a potential cardioprotective agent in a diabetic setting through its hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemia, and antioxidant properties."
2019,31260663,Effects of simvastatin on matrix metalloproteinase regulation in IL-1β-induced SW1353 cells.,"The present study shows the basis for the anti-inflammatory effects of statins in interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induced SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell-line. The cells were pre-treated with simvastatin (5 μM, 10 μM, and 50 μM), followed by IL-1β (5 ng/mL) stimulation. Effects of simvastatin on cell viability and cytotoxicity of chondrocytes were measured with WST-1 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, respectively. Under inflammatory conditions, in the absence/presence of simvastatin, the changes in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression levels were examined. Expression levels of MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -13, and TIMP-1 and -2 were examined by qPCR. MMP-1, -9, -13, TIMP-1, and -2 levels were also determined by Western blotting. Gelatin zymography was performed to analyze the released and intracellular MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity levels. The results showed that simvastatin downregulated the degradation related genes MMP-3, MMP-13, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner."
2018,29606435,Vitamin D-biofortified beef: A comparison of cholecalciferol with synthetic versus UVB-mushroom-derived ergosterol as feed source.,"This study investigates dietary fortification of heifer feeds with cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol sources and effects on beef total vitamin D activity, vitamer, respective 25-hydroxymetabolite contents, and meat quality. Thirty heifers were allocated to one of three dietary treatments [(1) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D3 (Vit D3); (2) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D2 (Vit D2); and (3) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D2-enriched mushrooms (Mushroom D2)] for a 30 day pre-slaughter period. Supplementation of heifer diets with Vit D3 yielded higher (p < 0.001) Longissimus thoracis (LT) total vitamin D activity (by 38-56%; p < 0.05) and serum 25-OH-D concentration (by 20-36%; p < 0.05), compared to that from Vit D2 and Mushroom D2 supplemented animals. Irrespective of vitamin D source, carcass characteristics, sensory and meat quality parameter were unaffected (p > 0.05) by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, vitamin D3 biofortification of cattle diets is the most efficacious way to enhance total beef vitamin D activity."
1999,10083977,Biochemical activities of extracts from Hypericum perforatum L. 1st Communication: inhibition of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.,"Extracts from the herb ""St. John's wort"" (Hypericum perforatum L.) are used for the treatment of mental depression, nervousness, sleeplessness and for their wound healing, diuretic and antirheumatic properties. As one biochemical mechanism for depression lack of catecholamine neurotransmitters has been discussed. The results of this investigation show that alcoholic extracts from Hypericum perforatum L. on the basis of total hypericin content inhibit dopamine-beta-hydroxylase with an IC50 of 0.1 mu mol/l; pure commercial hypericin inhibits with an IC50 of 21 mu mol/l. Enzymes involved in the synthesis of dopamine from tyrosine, namely tyrosinase and tyrosine decarboxylase, are not influenced by hypericin at concentrations from 1 up to 10 mu mol/l."
1998,9853404,Anti-metastatic and immunomodulating properties of the water extract from Celosia argentea seeds.,"We have investigated the anti-metastatic effect of Celosia argentea seed extracts (CAE), which have traditionally been used as a therapeutic drug for eye and hepatic diseases in China and Japan. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CAE for 7 d before tumor inoculation significantly inhibited liver metastasis caused by intraportal injection of colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. CAE also showed concentration dependent mitogenic activity on BALB/c whole splenocytes, whereas incubation of the non-adherent fraction of splenocytes with CAE did not induce this activity. CAE has the ability to induce interleukin (IL)-12 production from macrophages in vitro. Following i.p. administration of CAE the maximal levels of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production in serum were achieved at 2-3 and 6 h, respectively. Experiments using macrophage- or NK cell-deficient mice revealed that CAE-induced IL-12 in serum was not mediated by macrophages and that IFN-gamma production was mainly dependent on natural killer (NK) cells. Since CAE was inactive when the contributions of macrophages were removed in our system, its inhibitory mechanism is likely to be mainly associated with the activation of macrophages to an anti-metastatic state rather than NK cells. CAE administration resulted in increased production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and decreased production of a Th2 cytokine (IL-4) from splenocytes stimulated by PMA and A23187. Thus, the anti-metastatic effect by CAE is based on its immunomodulating properties including induction of cytokines such as IL-12, IL-2 and IFN-gamma leading to a Th1 dominant immune state and activating macrophages to the tumoricidal state. This may provide a basis for the inhibition of cancer metastasis."
2015,26245030,Effects of alcoholic extract of Curcuma longa on Ascaridia infestation affecting chicken.,"Ascaridia galli, the common intestinal nematode, remains a major cause of economic loss in the poultry industry in developing countries. Treatments using chemicals are not only expensive but also affect host health. Plant extracts as better alternative is gaining significance. Here, we have studied the effects of alcoholic extract of turmeric, Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae) roots, against A. galli infection in chicken. Different concentrations of C. longa root extract were tested in vitro on 5 groups of adults A. galli worms and in vivo on 6 groups of chicks. The results showed that the turmeric root extract @ 60 mg mL(-1) in vitro significantly (P < 0.001) proved paralytic and fatal against worms (16.80 ± 1.28 h). In vivo, chicken groups (G2-G6) were infected with an average of 300 ± 12 embryonated eggs of A. galli. The G2 was not given any treatment while G3 was treated with piperazine (@ 200 mg kg(-1) body wt.); and Groups 4, 5 and 6 were given turmeric @ 200, 400 and 600 mg kg(-1) body wt., respectively. The mean number of worms extracted at the end of the trial in G2 (untreated) was 18.10 ± 2.42, while the G3 treated with piperazine had no worms. Groups 4 and 5 did not show any significant difference compared to G2. However, G6 that had 3.20 ± 1.33 worms was statistically significant. Higher concentrations of turmeric given to infected chickens significantly reduced the length and weight of worms. The study showed that the worm infestation damaged the intestinal villi, and.treatment with high concentration of C. longa had healing effects and restored the integrity of intestinal mucosa. The results have demonstrated the ameliorating effect of C. longa turmeric on A. galli infested chickens."
2019,31270102,Posttransplant cyclophosphamide vs antithymocyte globulin in HLA-mismatched unrelated donor transplantation.,"The use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has represented the standard of care in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients undergoing a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) transplant. The safety and feasibility of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) in this setting have been reported recently, but no study has compared the outcomes of PTCY vs ATG in 9/10 MMUD transplants. Using the registry data of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we performed a matched-pair analysis comparing those 2 strategies in a 9/10 MMUD setting. Ninety-three patients receiving PTCY were matched with 179 patients receiving ATG. A significantly lower incidence of severe acute GVHD was observed with PTCY compared with ATG. Recipients of the former also showed higher leukemia-free survival and GVHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS). When performing a subgroup analysis including patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells, being in complete remission, or receiving the same associated immunosuppressive agents, superiority of PTCY over ATG was confirmed. Similar to the haploidentical setting, use of PTCY is an effective anti-GVHD prophylaxis in the 9/10 MMUD transplant. Use of PTCY may also provide better outcomes in long-term disease control. These results need confirmation in large prospective randomized trials."
2017,27930976,Nephro-protective effect of a novel formulation of unopened coconut inflorescence sap powder on gentamicin induced renal damage by modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.,"Fresh oyster white translucent sap obtained from the tender unopened inflorescence of coconut trees (Cocos nucifera) is identified to have great health benefits. Drug induced Nephrotoxicity is one of the major causes of renal damage in present generation. As a therapeutic agent, gentamicin imparts direct toxicity to kidney, resulting in acute tubular necrosis, glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, haemodynamically mediated damage and obstructive nephropathy.There exists an increasing demand for safe and natural agents for the treatment and/or preventionofchronic nephrotoxicity and pathogenesis of kidney diseases. Our study shows the nephro protective/curing effect of a novel powder formulation of micronutrient enriched, unfermented coconut flower sap (CSP). The study was performed on adult male Wistar rats. The animals were grouped into three and treated separately with vehicle, gentamicin and gentamicin+CSP for 16days. Initially, gentamicin treatment significantly (p<0.05)reduced thelevels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and GSH and increased (p<0.05) the levels of creatinine, uric acid, urea, inflammatory markers (nitrite, IL-6, TNF- α, iNOS) and lipid peroxidation. Supplementation of coconut flower sap powder showed significant (p<0.05) reversal of all these biochemical parameters indicating an effective inhibition of the pathogenesis of nephrotoxicity and kidney disease."
2015,24780080,Inhibition of COX-2-mediated eicosanoid production plays a major role in the anti-inflammatory effects of the endocannabinoid N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) in macrophages.,"N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (DHEA) is the ethanolamine conjugate of the long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22: 6n-3). Its concentration in animal tissues and human plasma increases when diets rich in fish or krill oil are consumed. DHEA displays anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and was found to be released during an inflammatory response in mice. Here, we further examine possible targets involved in the immune-modulating effects of DHEA.Antagonists for cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors and PPARγ were used to explore effects of DHEA on NO release by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The possible involvement of CB2 receptors was studied by comparing effects in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages obtained from CB2 (-/-) and CB2 (+/+) mice. Effects on NF-κB activation were determined using a reporter cell line. To study DHEA effects on COX-2 and lipoxygenase activity, 21 different eicosanoids produced by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells were quantified by LC-MS/MS. Finally, effects on mRNA expression profiles were analysed using gene arrays followed by Ingenuity(®) Pathways Analysis.CB1 and CB2 receptors or PPARs were not involved in the effects of DHEA on NO release. NF-κB and IFN-β, key elements of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein D88 (MyD88)-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways were not decreased. By contrast, DHEA significantly reduced levels of several COX-2-derived eicosanoids. Gene expression analysis provided support for an effect on COX-2-mediated pathways.Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of DHEA in macrophages predominantly take place via inhibition of eicosanoids produced through COX-2.This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids 2013 published in volume 171 issue 6.

2010,20206138,Falcarinol is a covalent cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist and induces pro-allergic effects in skin.,"The skin irritant polyyne falcarinol (panaxynol, carotatoxin) is found in carrots, parsley, celery, and in the medicinal plant Panax ginseng. In our ongoing search for new cannabinoid (CB) receptor ligands we have isolated falcarinol from the endemic Sardinian plant Seseli praecox. We show that falcarinol exhibits binding affinity to both human CB receptors but selectively alkylates the anandamide binding site in the CB(1) receptor (K(i)=594nM), acting as covalent inverse agonist in CB(1) receptor-transfected CHO cells. Given the inherent instability of purified falcarinol we repeatedly isolated this compound for biological characterization and one new polyyne was characterized. In human HaCaT keratinocytes falcarinol increased the expression of the pro-allergic chemokines IL-8 and CCL2/MCP-1 in a CB(1) receptor-dependent manner. Moreover, falcarinol inhibited the effects of anandamide on TNF-alpha stimulated keratinocytes. In vivo, falcarinol strongly aggravated histamine-induced oedema reactions in skin prick tests. Both effects were also obtained with the CB(1) receptor inverse agonist rimonabant, thus indicating the potential role of the CB(1) receptor in skin immunopharmacology. Our data suggest anti-allergic effects of anandamide and that falcarinol-associated dermatitis is due to antagonism of the CB(1) receptor in keratinocytes, leading to increased chemokine expression and aggravation of histamine action."
2010,20105177,The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761(R) and its main constituent flavonoids and ginkgolides increase extracellular dopamine levels in the rat prefrontal cortex.,"Experimental and clinical data suggest that extracts of Ginkgo biloba improve cognitive function. However, the neurochemical correlates of these effects are not yet fully clarified. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute and repeated oral administration of the standardized extract EGb 761((R)) on extracellular levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT), and the dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of conscious rats.Monoamines and their metabolites were monitored by the use of microdialysis sampling and HPLC with electrochemical or fluorescence detection.A single oral dose of EGb 761 (100 mg.kg(-1)) had no effect on monoamine levels. However, following chronic (100 mg.kg(-1)/14 days/once daily) treatment, the same dose significantly increased extracellular dopamine and noradrenaline levels, while 5-HT levels were unaffected. Chronic treatment with EGb 761 showed dose-dependent increases in frontocortical dopamine levels and, to a lesser extent, in the striatum. The extracellular levels of HVA and DOPAC were not affected by either acute or repeated doses. Treatment with the main constituents of EGb 761 revealed that the increase in dopamine levels was mostly caused by the flavonol glycosides and ginkgolide fractions, whereas bilobalide treatment was without effect.The present results demonstrate that chronic but not acute treatment with EGb 761 increased dopaminergic transmission in the PFC. This finding may be one of the mechanisms underlying the reported effects of G. biloba in improving cognitive function."
2010,20406214,Grapefruit juice enhances the exposure to oral oxycodone.,"Grapefruit juice alters the concentrations of many CYP3A substrates. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone in a randomized cross-over study with two phases at an interval of 4 weeks. Twelve healthy volunteers ingested 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water t.i.d. for 5 days. An oral dose of oxycodone hydrochloride 10 mg was administered on day 4. Oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone concentrations were analysed from the plasma samples for 48 hr and behavioural and analgesic effects were recorded for 12 hr. Grapefruit juice increased the mean area under the oxycodone concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞) ) by 1.7-fold (p<0.001), the peak plasma concentration by 1.5-fold (p<0.001) and the half-life of oxycodone by 1.2-fold (p<0.001) as compared to the water. The metabolite-to-parent AUC(0-∞) ratios (AUC(m)/AUC(p) ) of noroxycodone and noroxymorphone decreased by 44% (p<0.001) and 45% (p<0.001), respectively. Oxymorphone AUC(0-∞) increased by 1.6-fold (p<0.01) after grapefruit juice, but the AUC(m)/AUC(p) remained unchanged. Pharmacodynamic changes were modest and only self-reported performance significantly impaired after grapefruit juice. Analgesic effects were not influenced. Grapefruit juice inhibited the CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of oxycodone, decreased the formation of noroxycodone and noroxymorphone and increased that of oxymorphone. We conclude that dietary consumption of grapefruit products may increase the concentrations and effects of oxycodone in clinical use."
2007,17920764,Gambogic acid inhibits angiogenesis through suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1.,"Previous studies revealed that gambogic acid (GA), the major active ingredient of gamboge, a brownish to orange resin exuded from Garcinia hanburryi tree in Southeast Asia, possessed significant anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explored the high antiangiogenic activities of GA for the first time. GA inhibits the VEGF-stimulated proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings in vitro. Moreover, GA inhibits vessel growth in matrigel plugs and CAM in vivo and transplanted tumor in mice. The results also indicated that GA decreases VEGF production of cultured tumor cells and inhibits VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1. This inhibition of receptor phosphorylation is correlated with a significant decrease in VEGF-triggered phosphorylated forms of ERK, AKT and p38. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that GA might be a structurally novel angiogenesis inhibitor."
2007,16971197,"CYP17 and COMT gene polymorphisms can influence bone directly, or indirectly through their effects on endogenous sex steroids, in postmenopausal Japanese women.","We aimed to assess whether circulating sex steroids would influence bone density and bone loss, whether part of this influence could be explained by genetic variation measured as polymorphisms in candidate genes affecting circulating hormone levels, or whether gene polymorphisms would have direct effects on bone in 229 postmenopausal Japanese women aged 46 years and over who had been followed for eight years (Yokohama Cohort). Bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine (L), femoral neck (FN), total hip (T) and distal radius (R) was measured every year, and endogenous sex steroid levels were determined at the start of the study. We investigated the polymorphisms of estrogen-metabolizing enzyme gene, CYP17; estrogen biosynthesis (high activity, A2/A2), CYP1A1; hydroxylation (high inducibility, vt/vt) and COMT; inactivation (low activity, L/L) with PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (AND) levels significantly correlated with bone density in both the axial (L) and the appendicular skeleton (FN, T and R) (r=0.194-0.229; P<0.05) whereas estradiol (E2) and AND showed significant correlations with bone change only at the axial skeleton (r=0.205 and r=-0.139, respectively; P<0.05) on the total cohort. These correlations remained significant in thin/normal-weight women [body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2)] even after adjustment for years since menopause (YSM) and BMI or age and BMI, suggesting an interaction of BMI and sex steroid/BMD association. On the total cohort, a difference in endogenous DHEA levels between CYP17 homozygote A2 and non-homozygote A2; an increasing trend in AND levels from COMT L/L, L/H, to H/H; and a difference in TS level between COMT homozygote L and non-homozygote L were separately observed. All observations were significant for unadjusted and adjusted analysis, except for COMT and TS. In thin/normal-weight women (BMI <25 kg/m2), the same effects of CYP17 genotypes on DHEA were observed as on the total cohort. CYP17 and COMT genes showed some direct influence on bone density. Mean percent change in T-BMD was negative for CYP17 non-homozygote A2 in contrast to a positive value for homozygote A2. Mean percent change in R-BMD showed the difference between COMT homozygote L and non-homozygote L with a larger decrease for the homozygote L. Together, CYP17 and COMT genotypes might have some effect on bone both directly and indirectly through their effects on endogenous sex steroids in postmenopausal Japanese women."
2014,24587743,The enzymatic decolorization of textile dyes by the immobilized polyphenol oxidase from quince leaves.,"Water pollution due to release of industrial wastewater has already become a serious problem in almost every industry using dyes to color its products. In this work, polyphenol oxidase enzyme from quince (Cydonia Oblonga) leaves immobilized on calcium alginate beads was used for the successful and effective decolorization of textile industrial effluent. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme was extracted from quince (Cydonia Oblonga) leaves and immobilized on calcium alginate beads. The kinetic properties of free and immobilized PPO were determined. Quince leaf PPO enzyme stability was increased after immobilization. The immobilized and free enzymes were employed for the decolorization of textile dyes. The dye solutions were prepared in the concentration of 100 mg/L in distilled water and incubated with free and immobilized quince (Cydonia Oblonga) leaf PPO for one hour. The percent decolorization was calculated by taking untreated dye solution. Immobilized PPO was significantly more effective in decolorizing the dyes as compared to free enzyme. Our results showed that the immobilized quince leaf PPO enzyme could be efficiently used for the removal of synthetic dyes from industrial effluents. "
2008,26049997,Post-column on-line photochemical derivatization for the direct isocratic-LC-FLD analysis of resveratrol and piceid isomers in wine.,"Resveratrol is a stilbene produced by plants, e.g. grapes, in response to stress. Resveratrol is extracted during winemaking, being present in wine as 3-O-β-d-gluocoside (piceid) and as aglycone. Both, resveratrol and piceid exist in two isomeric forms, trans and cis. Resveratrol and piceid are weakly fluorescent in both of their isomeric forms, but highly fluorescent compounds are obtained when the original molecules are UV-irradiated. A chromatographic method with post-column on-line photoderivatization, has been developed for the analysis of resveratrol and piceid isomers. The four analytes are firstly separated in a C18 column (150mm×3.9mm i.d., 4μm) by isocratic elution, at 15°C, with a mobile phase consisting of a mixture acetonitrile:o-phosphoric acid (0.04%), 18:82, v:v, at 0.9mLmin(-1), and secondly they are on-line phototransformed into their fluorescent photoproducts in a 3m PTFE tube coiled around a 4W xenon lamp. The elution conditions have been chemometrically optimized by means of the experimental design and the response surface methodology. Linearity ranges from 0.10 to 1.50 and from 0.10 to 1.00μgmL(-1) and LOD around 0.001 and 0.01μgmL(-1) have been calculated for trans- and cis-isomers, respectively. The method has been satisfactorily applied to red and white wine samples by standard addition and external calibration, respectively. "
2013,23274418,Salvianic acid A protects L-02 cells against γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis via the scavenging of reactive oxygen species.,"Salvianic acid A (SAA) is the main hydrophilic active ingredient of Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, which has long been used to treat liver and heart disease in China. In the present study, we investigated the radioprotective effects of SAA against γ-radiation-induced apoptosis in cultured human embryo liver L-02 cells. The results demonstrated that SAA markedly inhibited γ-radiation induced apoptosis, decreased DNA damage, and increased the intracellular antioxidative ability of the L-02 cells. SAA exhibited radioprotection by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C, blocking the activation of caspase-3, and down regulating the expression of Bax and P53 and up regulating the expression of Bcl-2. This indicated that SAA pretreatment inhibited the caspase-dependent mitochondria apoptosis pathway. The radioprotection of the SAA pretreatment was also evidenced by an increased survival ratio, maintaining the antioxidant enzyme levels in the liver, inhibition of oxidative stress, and relative low liver and renal toxicity compared with estriol exposure. In conclusion, SAA may be an effective radioprotector against γ-radiation induced apoptosis in L-02 cells and damage in mice, the antioxidant potency of SAA might be correlated with the beneficial radioprotectant effects observed."
2013,23603339,Dehydroepiandrosterone post-transcriptionally modifies CYP1A2 induction involving androgen receptor.,"The pharmacological dosage of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) protects against chemically induced carcinogenesis. The chemoprotective activity of DHEA is attributed to its inhibitory potential for the expression of CYP1A enzymes, which are highly responsible for metabolic activation of several mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals. The present work investigated whether the chemoprevention by DHEA was due to diminished transcriptional activation of CYP1A genes or to the post-transcriptional modulation of CYP1A expression. In primary human hepatocytes, DHEA diminished the increase in CYP1A activities (7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and phenacetin O-dealkylation) and in CYP1A2 mRNA level induced by 3-methylcholanthrene, but did not alter the amount of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA. The androgen receptor seemed to be involved in DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction, which was attenuated in the presence of bicalutamide, the androgen receptor antagonist. The potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor in DHEA-mediated decrease in CYP1A2 induction was excluded. The developed computational model of CYP1A2 induction kinetics and CYP1A2 mRNA degradation proposed that a post-transcriptional mechanism was likely to be the primary mechanism of the DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction. The hypothesis was confirmed by the results of actinomycin D-chase experiments in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, displaying that the degradation rates of CYP1A2 mRNA were significantly higher in the cells exposed to DHEA. The novel findings on DHEA-mediated modulation of CYP1A2 mRNA stability may account for the beneficial effects of DHEA by decreasing the metabolic activation of pro-carcinogenic compounds."
2008,18523891,Mucoadhesive microspheres for gastroretentive delivery of acyclovir: in vitro and in vivo evaluation.,"The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential use of mucoadhesive microspheres for gastroretentive delivery of acyclovir. Chitosan, thiolated chitosan, Carbopol 71G and Methocel K15M were used as mucoadhesive polymers. Microsphere formulations were prepared using emulsion-chemical crosslinking technique and evaluated in vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo. Gelatin capsules containing drug powder showed complete dissolution (90.5 +/- 3.6%) in 1 h. The release of drug was prolonged to 12 h (78.8 +/- 3.9) when incorporated into mucoadhesive microspheres. The poor bioavailability of acyclovir is attributed to short retention of its dosage form at the absorption sites (in upper gastrointestinal tract to duodenum and jejunum). The results of mucoadhesion study showed better retention of thiolated chitosan microspheres (8.0 +/- 0.8 h) in duodenal and jejunum regions of intestine. The results of qualitative and quantitative GI distribution study also showed significant higher retention of mucoadhesive microspheres in upper GI tract. Pharmacokinetic study revealed that administration of mucoadhesive microspheres could maintain measurable plasma concentration of acyclovir through 24 h, as compared to 5 h after its administration in solution form. Thiolated chitosan microsphere showed superiority over the other formulations as observed with nearly 4.0-fold higher AUC(0-24) value (1,090 +/- 51 ng h/ml) in comparison to drug solution (281 +/- 28 ng h/ml). Overall, the result indicated prolonged delivery with significant improvement in oral bioavailability of acyclovir from mucoadhesive microspheres due to enhanced retention in the upper GI tract."
2012,22975510,Anti-apoptotic function and mechanism of ginseng saponins in Rattus pancreatic β-cells.,"Apoptosis is the main form of β-cell death in diabetes. Ginseng has been used as an anti-diabetic herb for several thousand years in Asia with ginsenoside Rg1 and ginsenoside Rb1 as important active ingredients. In this study, we demonstrated ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 protect β-cells from high glucose/cytokine-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis via inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production and regulating apoptosis-related genes. Among these genes, Bax, Fas and Caspase-3 gene expressions were up-regulated by high glucose, whereas only Bax and Caspase-3 gene expression were elevated by cytokines. In these two stimuli-induced apoptotic cells, Rg1 down-regulated Fas gene expression, while Rb1 decreased Caspase-3 gene expression. As a conclusion, Fas signal pathway and mitochondria stress is mostly related to anti-diabetes function of ginsenoside Rg1, while Caspase-3 pathway is essential when Rb1 is present."
1992,1738791,Effects of four non-cholinergic cognitive enhancers in comparison with tacrine and galanthamine on scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats.,"Amnesia can be induced in rats in the passive avoidance paradigm by administration of scopolamine, a central muscarinic receptor antagonist. Tacrine or galanthamine, inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, given in conjunction with scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance performance. Four so-called cognitive enhancers, all widely used for the treatment of the symptoms associated with mental aging, cerebral insufficiency and senile memory disorder, were investigated in this paradigm. Piracetam, an extract of Ginkgo biloba, dihydroergocristine and a combination of raubasine with dihydroergocristine, all attenuated the amnesia induced by scopolamine. In contrast, nicergoline had no significant effect. Raubasine alone also failed to significantly attenuate scopolamine-induced amnesia, although some doses of raubasine had a non-significant tendency (P less than 0.10) to reduce the amnesia."
2016,27153368,Kinetic determination of vitellogenin induction in the epidermis of cyprinid and perciform fishes: Evaluation of sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.,"Induction of vitellogenin (VTG) in male and immature fish is a standardized endpoint in endocrine-disruption testing. To establish a nondestructive swab sampling method, VTG induction in the epidermis of Cypriniformes and Perciformes species was investigated. Both VTG and estrogen receptor genes are expressed in epidermal cells. Immunoaffinity and mass fingerprint analyses show induction of identical VTG peptides in liver and epidermis. Induction of VTG by estradiol (E2) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the epidermis was quantified with homolog enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Initial values in juveniles and males were below 1 ng VTG/mL extraction buffer. Exposure to E2 led to values between 200 ng/mL and 4600 ng/mL in cyprinids and between 10 ng/mL and 81 ng/mL in perciforms. Exposure to BPA increased VTG amounts to 250 ng/mL in fathead minnows, 1360 ng/mL in goldfish, 100 ng/mL in zebrafish, and 12 ng/mL in bluegills. Serum VTG contents demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern in the epidermis and the blood. These results show that VTG induction may be reliably assessed in the skin mucus of fishes, demonstrating the suitability of this biological sample for investigating estrogenic activity in compliance with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development standard protocols. This broadens the perspectives in toxicological screening and environmental monitoring, reducing the number of tested animals and minimizing harmful effects for animals, allowing for follow-up of individual induction profiles.

2005,15890236,Growth inhibitory effect of alk(en)yl thiosulfates derived from onion and garlic in human immortalized and tumor cell lines.,"Two alk(en)yl thiosulfates, sodium n-propyl thiosulfate (NPTS) and sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate (2PTS), are natural constituents of onion and garlic, respectively, which were identified originally as causative agents of onion- and garlic-induced hemolytic anemia in dogs. As a continuation of our studies on the beneficial functions of NPTS and 2PTS, in the present study, we investigated the antitumor effects of these compounds. They were shown to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of three human tumorigenic cell lines, WiDr, 293 and HL-60, in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, NPTS seemed to have weak activity for inhibiting cell growth compared with 2PTS, though not in WiDr cells, which were sensitive to both compounds. NPTS and 2PTS caused oxidative damage to HL-60 cells and induced apoptosis. The extent of apoptosis was approximately proportional to that of the oxidative damage and also to that of the cytotoxicity caused by these compounds. These results suggest that the alk(en)yl thiosulfates have an antitumor effect through the induction of apoptosis initiated by oxidative stress."
2000,10755708,The influence of thymoquinone on doxorubicin-induced hyperlipidemic nephropathy in rats.,"The effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of the volatile oil of Nigella sativa seeds, on the nephropathy and oxidative stress induced by doxorubicin (DOX) in rats was investigated. A single intravenous injection of DOX (6 mg/kg) induced a severe nephrotic syndrome (after 5 weeks) associated with hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, elevated serum urea, hyperlipidemia, and a high urinary excretion of protein, albumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). In the kidney, DOX induced a significant increase in total triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and lipid peroxides and a significant decrease in non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) content and catalase (CAT) activity. Treatment of rats with TQ (10 mg/kg per day) supplemented with the drinking water for 5 days before DOX, and daily thereafter, significantly lowered serum urea, TG, and TC. Similarly, TG, TC and lipid peroxides in the kidneys of TQ-treated rats were decreased significantly compared with DOX alone. Moreover, NPSH content and CAT activity in the kidneys of TQ-treated DOX group were significantly elevated compared with DOX alone. Treatment with TQ significantly suppressed DOX-induced proteinuria, albuminuria, and urinary excretion of NAG. The results confirm the involvement of free radicals in the pathogenesis of nephropathy induced by DOX. Likewise, the study demonstrates the high antioxidant potential of TQ and its marked effect on the suppression of DOX-induced nephropathy. The data suggest that TQ might be applicable as a protective agent for proteinuria and hyperlipidemia associated with nephrotic syndrome."
2010,20478691,[Atrial fibrillation: who should be anticoagulated?].,"The growing incidence of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) induces an increasing morbimortality, particularly thromboembolism (TE). Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) reduce of 62 % the stroke rate in case of AF and are more efficient with INR between 2 and 3 than aspirin or the association aspirin-VKA with INR<2. The only place for clopidogrel could be its association with aspirin if VKA are contra-indicated. But VKA increase of 1.4 to 3.36 %/year the major bleedings, whereas the risk with aspirin is less important. The TE risk factors validated in case of AF are: previous TE, heart failure, hypertension, age over 75, diabetes mellitus, rhumatismal valvulopathy or mechanical valvular prosthesis. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, age between 65 and 75 and the female gender represent intermediate risks. Guidelines suggest to anticoagulate patients with previous TE or CHADS(2) score > or = 2 and to discuss VKA for a score equal to 1. Lone AF must not be anticoagulated but the continuous follow-up of occurring risk factors remains essential. Paroxysmal and persistant/permanent AF present the same TE risk. VKA are preferable if patients are older than 75 unless a major bleeding risk is present. If AF occurs on an ischemic cardiomyopathy, VKA are often essential and reduce the total mortality even if they increase the bleeding risk due to the association with antiplatelet therapy. However no precise guidelines are available on this topic. After a successful AF ablation, guidelines recommend not to modify the antithrombotic strategy. The bleeding risk score called ""HEMORR2HAGE"" allows to establish an individual balance of risk/benefit of VKA. The utility of transoesophagial echocardiography could be recognized in case of intermediate TE risk to suggest VKA if thrombotic criteria are identified. At least, new antithrombotic therapy will probably modify our perception of the risk/benefit ratio."
2014,24767088,Metal solubility enhancing peptides derived from barley protein.,"Mineral supplements are required to be soluble as their bioavailability is highly correlated to their solubility in body fluids. In this study, metal binding capacity of barley protein hydrolysates and their purified fractions was investigated and expressed as increase in solubility of metal ions. Metal ions in the presence of hydrolysates exhibited a remarkable increase in solubility: 118, 32, 10, 29 and 35-fold for Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Ca(2+), Cu(2+) and Zn(2+), respectively. A mixture of low molecular weight peptides possesses a synergistic combination of both charged and hydrophobic residues and achieves the best binding metal ions. Electrostatic interactions via charged side chains and coordination binding with His and Cys, initially attract the metal ions and, afterward, hydrophobic interactions and aromatic ring stacking stabilize the positioning of metal ions in the structure of the peptide. Barley hordein hydrolysates show potential as dietary supplements that enhance both mineral solubility and bioavailability. "
1997,9055991,"Glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice roots, reduces morbidity and mortality of mice infected with lethal doses of influenza virus.","The antiviral effect of glycyrrhizin (GR), an active component of licorice roots, was investigated in mice infected with influenza virus A2 (H2N2). When mice that had been exposed to 10 50% lethal doses of the virus were treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg of GR per kg of body weight 1 day before infection and 1 and 4 days postinfection, all of the mice survived over the 21-day experimental period. At the end of this period, the mean survival time (in days) for control mice treated with saline was 10.5 days, and there were no survivors. The grade of pulmonary consolidations and the virus titers in the lung tissues of infected mice treated with GR were significantly lower than those in the lung tissues of infected mice treated with saline. GR did not show any effects on the viability or replication of influenza virus A2 in vitro. When splenic T cells from GR-treated mice were adoptively transferred to mice exposed to influenza virus, 100% of the recipients survived, compared to 0% survival for recipient mice inoculated with naive T cells or splenic B cells and macrophages from GR-treated mice. In addition, the antiviral activities of GR on influenza virus infection in mice were not demonstrated when it was administered to infected mice in combination with anti-gamma interferon (anti-IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that GR may protect mice exposed to a lethal amount of influenza virus through the stimulation of IFN-gamma production by T cells, because T cells have been shown to be producer cells of IFN-gamma stimulated with the compound."
2006,16779533,"Crataegus special extract WS 1442 induces an endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasorelaxation via eNOS-phosphorylation at serine 1177.","This study investigates the influence of WS(R) 1442, a special extract of Crataegus leaves with flowers, on the relaxation of rat aorta and human mammarian artery (coronary bypass patients).Experiments were performed in the presence and absence (mechanical disruption) of endothelium. In addition, we investigated three fractions of WS(R) 1442 (fraction A: lipophilic, containing flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins (OPC), fraction B: hydrophilic, containing flavonoids and low molecular weight OPC, fraction C: hydrophilic, essentially flavonoid-free and rich in high molecular weight OPC).WS 1442 induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation in isolated vessel rings that had been precontracted by 10 microM phenylephrine (concentration for halfmaximal relaxation (IC(50)): rat: 15.1 +/- 0.6 microg/ml (n = 7), human: 19.3 +/- 3.4 microg/ml (n = 6)). The maximal vasorelaxation induced after application of 100 microg of WS 1442 was 75.0 +/- 5.7% (rat) and 79.2 +/- 5.8% (human) of the papaverine (0.1 mM)-induced vasodilation. If the experiments were performed in the presence of L-nitroarginine methylester (10 microM, eNOS-inhibition) or after mechanical disruption of the endothelium, no vasorelaxation was observed in the presence of WS 1442. The vasorelaxant properties of WS 1442 were mediated by fraction C. WS 1442 induced an NO-liberation from human coronary artery endothelial cells as measured by diaminofluorescein. WS 1442 induced eNOS-activation was due to a phosphorylation at serine 1177. No eNOS-translocation or phosphorylation at serine 114 or threonine 495 was observed after application of WS 1442.It is concluded that WS 1442, induces an endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasorelaxation via eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1177."
1985,2998265,Effects of wheat bran and porridge oats on hepatic portal venous volatile fatty acids in the pig.,"Adult male pigs (40-60 kg of body weight) of the Kangaroo Island strain were surgically implanted with chronic indwelling hepatic portal venous cannulae. After a 24-hour fast the animals were given meals containing 500 g of either wheat bran or porridge oats and 200 g of sucrose and 2 litres of milk. With both cereal preparations plasma volatile fatty acids rose in the hepatic portal vein but the increase was significantly greater with wheat bran. Omission of sucrose and milk did not alter the response to porridge oats but diminished the response to wheat bran. These changes in plasma volatile fatty acids were unaffected by prior cooking of the cereals with hot water. With all test meals acetate and propionate were the major acids found, with butyrate contributing less than 8% of the total. This compositional profile was also found when the pigs were fed a commercial ration. The absence of butyrate differed from observations in the rat and reflected low concentrations of this acid in large bowel digesta. The difference in the response of the concentration of volatile fatty acids to feeding porridge oats and wheat bran in the pig was also the reverse of that found in the rat. These species differences may be of significance in relation to the choice of animal models for human fibre metabolism."
2017,28372252,Quantification of inositol phosphates in almond meal and almond brown skins by HPLC/ESI/MS.,"The extraction and measurement of all six forms of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in almond meal and brown skins were improved from existing methods by pH adjustment, supplementation of EDTA, and rapid analysis via anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The quantity of InsPs in six major almond cultivars ranged from 8 to 12μmol/g in the meal and 5 to 14μmol/g in the brown skins. InsP6 was the dominant form, but lower forms still accounted for ∼20% of the total InsPs molar concentration in a majority of the samples. InsPs contributed 32-55% of the organic phosphorus content and 20-38% of the total phosphorus content in the meal. In brown skins, these ranges were 44-77% and 30-52%, respectively. The successful application of this analytical method with almonds demonstrates its potential use for re-examination of the reported phytic acid contents in many other tree nuts, legumes, grains, and complex foods."
2011,21468923,Effects of rutaecarpine on the metabolism and urinary excretion of caffeine in rats.,"Although rutaecarpine, an alkaloid originally isolated from the unripe fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa, has been reported to reduce the systemic exposure of caffeine, the mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear. We investigated the microsomal enzyme activity using hepatic S-9 fraction and the plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary excretion of caffeine and its major metabolites after an oral administration of caffeine in the presence and absence of rutaecarpine in rats. Following oral administration of 80 mg/kg rutaecarpine for three consecutive days, caffeine (20 mg/kg) was given orally. Plasma and urine were collected serially for up to 24 h and the plasma and urine concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites were measured, and compared with those in control rats. The areas under the curve of both caffeine and its three major metabolites (paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine) were significantly reduced by rutaecarpine, indicating that caffeine was rapidly converted into the desmethylated metabolites, and that those were also quickly transformed into further metabolites via the hydroxyl metabolites due to the remarkable induction of CYP1A2 and 2E1. The significant induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase, and p-nitrophenol hydroxylase strongly supported the decrease in caffeine and its major metabolites in plasma, as well as in urine. These results clearly suggest that rutaecarpine increases the metabolism of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine by inducing CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 in rats."
2011,20413560,Protective effects of melatonin and Glycyrrhiza glabra extract on ochratoxin A--induced damages on testes in mature rats.,"The effect of Glycyrrhiza glabra extract (GgE) as a natural antioxidant and melatonin (MEL) on ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced histopathological damages on the testes and oxidative stress was evaluated in male rats. The animals were assigned into four groups (n = 8) including control and test groups. The rats in control group received saline and the animals in the test groups received (200 µg/kg) of OTA, (15 mg/kg) of MEL + (200 µg/kg) OTA and (100 mg/kg) of GgE + (200 µg/kg) OTA, respectively, during 28 consecutive days. The serum total antioxidant power (TAOP) and total thiol molecules (TTM) production were assessed. Moreover, histopathological and histochemical studies were also performed. The results showed that the TAOP and TTM were decreased in OTA-exposed rats, while the animals that received MEL + OTA or GgE + OTA showed an enhancement in the serum TAOP and TTM levels. Histopathological analyses demonstrated that in OTA-exposed rats, the testicular degeneration, seminiferous tubule atrophy, dissociation of germinative epithelium, vasodilatation with vascular thrombosis, perivascular immune cell infiltration, hypertrophied leydic cells, giant cell formation, and negative tubular differentiation index (TDI) were observed. Surprisingly, both the biochemical and histopathological examinations showed that MEL and GgE, albeit with some differences, exerted a protective effect on OTA-induced damages. In conclusion, this data suggest that OTA contamination in animal feeds and human foods could cause reproductive abnormalities. Our data also indicate that OTA, at least partly by interfering in oxidative stress system, exerts its toxic effects on testes whereas MEL and GgE with antioxidant properties could fairly protect rats against OTA toxic effects."
2014,24686988,Autologous haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in multiple myeloma and lymphoma patients: a position statement from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,"Autologous haematopoietic SCT with PBSCs is regularly used to restore BM function in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma after myeloablative chemotherapy. Twenty-eight experts from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation developed a position statement on the best approaches to mobilising PBSCs and on possibilities of optimising graft yields in patients who mobilise poorly. Choosing the appropriate mobilisation regimen, based on patients' disease stage and condition, and optimising the apheresis protocol can improve mobilisation outcomes. Several factors may influence mobilisation outcomes, including older age, a more advanced disease stage, the type of prior chemotherapy (e.g., fludarabine or melphalan), prior irradiation or a higher number of prior treatment lines. The most robust predictive factor for poor PBSC collection is the CD34(+) cell count in PB before apheresis. Determination of the CD34(+) cell count in PB before apheresis helps to identify patients at risk of poor PBSC collection and allows pre-emptive intervention to rescue mobilisation in these patients. Such a proactive approach might help to overcome deficiencies in stem cell mobilisation and offers a rationale for the use of novel mobilisation agents. "
2012,22466555,Hydroxysafflor yellow A alleviates early inflammatory response of bleomycin-induced mice lung injury.,"Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is an effective ingredient of Chinese herb Carthamus tinctorius L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of HSYA on inflammatory phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury in mice. Three doses of HSYA (26.7, 40, 60 mg/kg/d) were intraperitoneally injected to mice consecutively for 1 week after bleomycin administration. It was found that HSYA attenuated the loss in body weight, the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and pathologic changes of pulmonary inflammation caused by bleomycin. Treatment with HSYA also alleviated bleomycin-induced increase of mRNA level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in lung homogenates. Moreover HSYA inhibited the increased activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in lung tissue. These findings demonstrated that HSYA had protective effect on bleomycin-induced lung inflammatory response."
2008,18379079,Pectolinarin and Pectolinarigenin of Cirsium setidens Prevent the Hepatic Injury in Rats Caused by D-Galactosamine via an Antioxidant Mechanism.,"To identify the hepatoprotective component from the leaves of Cirsium setidens (Compositae), the methanolic extract was divided into two fractions, chloroform and butanol fractions, and their hepatoprotective efficacy was evaluated in a rat model of hepatic injury caused by D-galactosamine (GalN). Hepatoprotective activity was measured by the activity of serum aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Glutathione metabolism was measured via biochemical parameters such as glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. We subjected the butanol fraction, which had higher activity, to column chromatography to yield pectolinarin, which was further hydrolyzed to yield pectolinarigenin. Administration (10, 20 mg/kg, p.o.) of the main flavonoid glycoside component, pectolinarin, and its aglycone, pectolinarigenin, for 2 weeks significantly decreased the activity levels of AST, ALT, ALP and LDH, indicating that the two compounds have hepatoprotective activity. Pectolinarin and pectolinarigenin also increased activity levels of GSH, GR, GCS, and GST, as well as SOD. The significant effect was only seen in SOD activity. This suggests that the two components exhibit hepatoprotective activity mainly via SOD antioxidant mechanism."
2013,24088251,Sodium alginate inhibits methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis in rats.,"Gastrointestinal mucositis is one of the most prevalent side effects of chemotherapy. Methotrexate is a pro-oxidant compound that depletes dihydrofolate pools and is widely used in the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies. Through its effects on normal tissues with high rates of proliferation, methotrexate treatment leads to gastrointestinal mucositis. In rats, methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis is histologically characterized by crypt loss, callus fusion and atrophy, capillary dilatation, and infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells. The water-soluble dietary fiber sodium alginate (AL-Na) is derived from seaweed and has demonstrated muco-protective and hemostatic effects on upper gastrointestinal ulcers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of AL-Na on methotrexate-induced small intestinal mucositis in rats. Animals were subcutaneously administered methotrexate at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg once daily for 3 d. Rats were treated with single oral doses of AL-Na 30 min before and 6 h after methotrexate administration. On the 4th day, small intestines were removed and weighed. Subsequently, tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and bromodeoxyuridine. AL-Na significantly prevented methotrexate-induced small intestinal mucositis. Moreover, AL-Na prevented decreases in red blood cell numbers, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit levels. These results suggest the potential of AL-Na as a therapy for methotrexate-induced small intestinal mucositis."
1999,10460065,Grapefruit juice increases serum concentrations of atorvastatin and has no effect on pravastatin.,"Grapefruit juice greatly increases the bioavailability of lovastatin and simvastatin. We studied the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and pravastatin.Two randomized, two-phase crossover studies were performed--study I with atorvastatin in 12 healthy volunteers and study II with pravastatin in 11 healthy volunteers. In both studies, volunteers took 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice or water three times a day for 2 days. On day 3, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of atorvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II) with either 200 mL grapefruit juice or water, and an additional 200 mL was ingested 1/2 hour and 1 1/2 hours later. In addition, subjects took 200 mL grapefruit juice or water three times a day on days 4 and 5 in study I. In study I, serum concentrations of atorvastatin acid, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone, and active and total 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were measured up to 72 hours. In study II, pravastatin, pravastatin lactone, and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 24 hours.Grapefruit juice increased the area under the serum concentration-time curve of atorvastatin acid from time zero to 72 hours [AUC(0-72)] 2.5-fold (P < .01), whereas the peak serum concentration (Cmax) was not significantly changed. The time of the peak concentration (tmax) and the elimination half-life (t1/2) of atorvastatin acid were increased (P < .01). The AUC(0-72) of atorvastatin lactone was increased 3.3-fold (P < .01) and the Cmax 2.6-fold (P < .01) by grapefruit juice, and the tmax and t1/2 were also increased (P < .05). Grapefruit juice decreased the Cmax (P < .001) and AUC(0-72) (P < .001) of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid and increased its tmax and t1/2 (P < .01). Grapefruit juice also decreased the Cmax (P < .001) and AUC(O-72) (P < .05) of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. The AUC(0-72) values of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased 1.3-fold (P < .05) and 1.5-fold (P < .01), respectively, by grapefruit juice. In study II, the only significant change observed in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin was prolongation of the tmax of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors by grapefruit juice (P < .05).Grapefruit juice significantly increased serum concentrations of atorvastatin acid, atorvastatin lactone, and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by decreasing CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of atorvastatin in the small intestine. On the other hand, grapefruit juice had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Concomitant use of atorvastatin and at least large amounts of grapefruit juice should be avoided, or the dose of atorvastatin should be reduced accordingly."
2019,30827671,Metabolomic analysis of energy regulated germination and sprouting of organic mung bean (Vigna radiata) using NMR spectroscopy.,"Germination and sprouting are regulated by the energy status. In the present study, mung bean seeds were treated with adenosine triphosphate and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The metabolomic changes during development of mung beans under different energy statuses were investigated. In total, 42 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis revealed that the featured compounds produced in seeds were oleic, linoleic, and succinic acids. Sugars, including maltose, sucrose, and glucose were related to sprouting. Mung bean seeds utilised diverse energy resources and produced higher succinic acid content. Sugars and secondary metabolites accumulated in sprouts. Nitrogen, sugar, and amino acid metabolism pathways contributed to this physiological process. DNP caused an energy deficit, which resulted in the consumption and translation of glucose. Higher contents of other saccharides and amino acids were observed. The transcriptional results further confirmed our metabolic hypothesis. In conclusion, sufficient energy supply is crucial for sprout development and nutritive metabolite synthesis."
2003,12699903,The inhibitory effects of manganese on steroidogenesis in rat primary Leydig cells by disrupting steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression.,"Manganese is known to impede the male reproductive function, however, the mechanisms through which the adverse effects are mediated are not clearly elucidated. In order to get insight into those mechanisms, the effects of manganese on the biosynthesis of testosterone by primary rat Leydig cells were examined. Primary Leydig cells were exposed to various concentrations of manganese chloride for different periods of time. Dose and time-dependent reductions of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone level were observed in the culture medium. The expression of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR) protein and the activities of P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) enzymes were also detected. The expression of StAR protein stimulated by hCG was suppressed by manganese chloride at all concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mM) and time points (2, 4, 24, 48 h) tested. Progesterone productions treated with 22R-hydroxycholesterol or pregnenolone were reduced after treated by manganese chloride for 24 or 48 h, respectively. The manganese exposure effect on cell viability was significant at 1.0 and 1.5 mM at 24 h, while at 48 h it was significant at every concentration tested. The decreasing effect of manganese on mitochondrial membrane potential was significant at every concentration measured and every time point tested. These data suggest that manganese exposure for 2 and 4 h inhibited rat primary Leydig cell steroidogenesis by decreasing StAR protein expression while 24 and 48 h exposure of manganese chloride caused adverse effects on both StAR protein and P450scc and 3beta-HSD enzyme activity to reduce steroidogenesis. Manganese may also disrupt StAR expression and/or function secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction."
2015,25172707,"Structure, morphology and functionality of acetylated and oxidised barley starches.","Acetylation and oxidation are chemical modifications which alter the properties of starch. The degree of modification of acetylated and oxidized starches is dependent on the catalyst and active chlorine concentrations, respectively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of acetylation and oxidation on the structural, morphological, physical-chemical, thermal and pasting properties of barley starch. Barley starches were acetylated at different catalyst levels (11%, 17%, and 23% of NaOH solution) and oxidized at different sodium hypochlorite concentrations (1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% of active chlorine). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties, swelling power and solubility of starches were evaluated. The degree of substitution (DS) of the acetylated starches increased with the rise in catalyst concentration. The percentage of carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (COOH) groups in oxidized starches also increased with the rise of active chlorine level. The presence of hydrophobic acetyl groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups caused a partial disorganization and depolymerization of starch granules. The structural, morphological and functional changes in acetylated and oxidized starches varied according to reaction conditions. Acetylation makes barley starch more hydrophobic by the insertion of acetyl groups. Also the oxidation promotes low retrogradation and viscosity. All these characteristics are important for biodegradable film production. "
2017,27263537,Changes in the Serum Levels of Trace Elements Before and After the Operation in Thyroid Cancer Patients.,"The present study aims to examine the changes in the serum levels of trace elements before and after the operation in thyroid cancer patients. The study registered 50 individuals, of whom 25 were female and 25 were male. The patients were allocated to four groups: group 1: male thyroid cancer patients group (n = 15), group 2: female thyroid cancer patients group (n = 15), group 3: male control group (n = 10), group 4: female control group (n = 10). The subjects in groups 1 and 2 were the patients who were post-operatively diagnosed with a pathological malignancy in the thyroid tissue samples. Blood samples were collected from all subjects before the operation, immediately after the operation, and on the post-operative day 15. Additionally, thyroid tissue samples were taken from all subjects post-operatively. Some elements in the blood and tissue samples were determined using the atomic emission method. Zinc and selenium levels of groups 1 and 2 in the pre- and post-operative measurements were significantly lower than those in the control groups (p < 0.05), but were higher in the thyroid tissue (p < 0.05). Serum zinc and selenium levels measured in the subjects on the post-operative day 15 were similar to those measured in the controls. Our study show that changes in the serum and thyroid tissue levels of trace elements like zinc and selenium, which play a critical role in thyroid function, might be associated with the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer."
2016,26479869,"Tracing microbiota changes in yamahai-moto, the traditional Japanese sake starter.","Sake is made from steamed rice, malted rice, and water. Sake production begins with the preparation of a small-scale starter (moto); the quality of moto significantly influences the flavor and richness of sake. In the traditional starter, yamahai-moto, the growth of naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria represses the putrefactive micro-organisms, whereas in the modern starter, sokujo-moto, this is achieved by adding lactic acid. In this study, the successive change in bacterial flora of yamahai-moto was analyzed by pyrosequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Lactobacillus was dominant throughout the process (93-98%). Nitrate-reducing bacteria that have been generally assumed to be the first colonizers of yamahai-moto were scarcely found in the early stage, but Lactobacillus acidipiscis dominated. Lactobacillus sakei drastically increased in the middle stage. This is the first report, though one case study, to show how the early stage microbiota in Japanese yamahai-moto is varyingly controlled without nitrate-reducing bacteria using next-generation sequencing.

2016,27170515,Carvacrol Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis and Negatively Regulates the Survival of Mature Osteoclasts.,"Bone is a dynamic tissue that undergoes continuous remodeling coupled with the action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoclast activity is elevated during osteoporosis and periodontitis resulting in excessive loss of trabecular and alveolar bone. Osteoclasts are formed in an inflammatory response to cytokine production receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) and bacterial challenge lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Carvacrol, a monoterpenic phenol present in Origanum vulgare and Thymus vulgaris, is a natural compound with known medicinal properties. We investigated the effects of carvacrol on osteoclast formation induced by RANKL and LPS. Carvacrol suppressed RANKL-induced formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells in RAW264.7 macrophages and human CD14(+) monocytes. Furthermore, carvacrol inhibited LPS-induced osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 macrophages. Investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that carvacrol downregulated RANKL-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the suppression of NF-κB activation correlated with inhibition of inhibitor of kappaB (IκB) kinase (IKK) activation and attenuation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBa) degradation. Carvacrol potentiated apoptosis in mature osteoclasts by caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, carvacrol did not affect the viability of proliferating MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that carvacrol mitigates osteoclastogenesis by impairing the NF-κB pathway and induction of apoptosis in mature osteoclasts. "
2014,25378912,Gastroprotective activity of Annona muricata leaves against ethanol-induced gastric injury in rats via Hsp70/Bax involvement.,"The popular fruit tree of Annona muricata L. (Annonaceae), known as soursop and graviola, is a widely distributed plant in Central and South America and tropical countries. Leaves of A. muricata have been reported to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, the gastroprotective effects of ethyl acetate extract of A. muricata leaves (EEAM) were investigated against ethanol-induced gastric injury models in rats. The acute toxicity test of EEAM in rats, carried out in two doses of 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg, showed the safety of this plant, even at the highest dose of 2 g/kg. The antiulcer study in rats (five groups, n=6) was performed with two doses of EEAM (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) and with omeprazole (20 mg/kg), as a standard antiulcer drug. Gross and histological features showed the antiulcerogenic characterizations of EEAM. There was significant suppression on the ulcer lesion index of rats pretreated with EEAM, which was comparable to the omeprazole effect in the omeprazole control group. Oral administration of EEAM to rats caused a significant increase in the level of nitric oxide and antioxidant activities, including catalase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase associated with attenuation in gastric acidity, and compensatory effect on the loss of gastric wall mucus. In addition, pretreatment of rats with EEAM caused significant reduction in the level of malondialdehyde, as a marker for oxidative stress, associated with an increase in prostaglandin E2 activity. Immunohistochemical staining also demonstrated that EEAM induced the downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Hsp70 proteins after pretreatment. Collectively, the present results suggest that EEAM has a promising antiulcer potential, which could be attributed to its suppressive effect against oxidative damage and preservative effect toward gastric wall mucus.

1996,8987560,Amino acid sequence and some properties of lectin-D from the roots of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana).,"Two pokeweed lectins, designated PL-D1 and PL-D2, have been isolated from the roots of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) using chitin affinity column chromatography followed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column and fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column, and their amino acid sequences have been analyzed. PL-D1 consists of 84 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 9317, while PL-D2 has an identical sequence with PL-D1 except lack of the C-terminal Leu-Thr. PL-D is composed of two chitin-binding domains, A and B, with 50% homology with each other. Both PL-Ds did not agglutinate native rabbit erythrocytes, but showed about 0.1% of the agglutinating activity of wheat germ agglutinin toward trypsin-treated erythrocytes. In the presence of beta (1-->4) linked oligomers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which inhibit the hemagglutination, PL-D1 had an ultraviolet-difference spectrum with maxima at 292-294 nm and 284-285 nm, attributed to the red shift of the tryptophan residue, suggesting the location of tryptophan residue(s) at or near saccharide-binding site of PL-D1."
2011,20888807,Storage xyloglucans: potent macrophages activators.,"Storage xyloglucans from the seeds of Copaifera langsdorffii, Hymenaea courbaril and Tamarindus indica were obtained by aqueous extraction from the milled and defatted cotyledons, XGC, XGJ and XGT, respectively. The resulting fractions showed similar monosaccharide composition with Glc:Xyl:Gal molar ratios of 2.4:1.5:1.0, 3.8:1.5:1,0 and 3.6:2.4:1.0 for XGC, XGJ and XGT, respectively. High-performance size-exclusion chromatography of the polysaccharides showed unimodal profiles, and the average molar mass (M(w)) was obtained for XGC (9.6 × 10⁵ g/mol), XGJ (9.1 × 10⁵ g/mol) and XGT (7.3 × 10⁵ g/mol). The immunomodulatory effects of the xyloglucans on peritoneal macrophages were evaluated. Phagocytic activity was observed in macrophages treated with XGT. The effect of XGT was tested on the production of O₂(.-) and NO. At 25 μg/ml XGT caused a 100% increase in NO production when compared to the control group; however, it did not affect O₂(.-) production in the absence of PMA. The production of TNF-α, interleukins 1β and 6 by macrophages in the presence of the xyloglucans was evaluated. The polysaccharides affected the production of the cytokines by macrophages to different degrees. XGC caused an enhancement of IL-1β and TNF-α production, compared to the other xyloglucans. For IL-6 production, XGT gave greater stimulation than XGC and XGJ, reaching 87% at 50 μg/ml. XGJ promoted a statistically significant effect on all cytokine productions tested. The results indicate that the xyloglucans from C. langsdorffii, H. courbaril and T. indica can be classified as biological response modifiers (BRM)."
2017,27482986,Fetopathies associated with exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor from Tropaeolum majus L.,"The prevalence of the use of herbal medicines is on the rise across the world, especially amongst pregnant women. A fact that draws attention is that many species commonly used by pregnant women, including the Tropaeolum majus L. (Tropaeolaceae), also present inhibitory activity on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Herein, we have investigated the effects of T. majus extract (HETM) on fetal development, evaluating its relationship with possible ACE inhibitory activity. Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with different HETM doses (3, 30 and 300 mg/kg/day) from gestational days 8-20. Rats were sacrificed on the day 20 of pregnancy and the following parameters were evaluated: clinical symptoms of maternal toxicity; maternal body weight; feed and water intake; maternal liver, kidney, and ovary weights, maternal ACE activity and aldosterone levels, live fetuses mean; dead fetuses percentage, fetus weight, and fetal malformation. All pregnant rats treated with high HETM doses showed significant reduction in plasma ACE activity accompanied by a decrease in serum aldosterone levels. Moreover, significant changes in fetal development were observed, including growth retardation and renal damage after 20 days of gestation. Thus, data presented demonstrate the significant effects of the use of HETM on fetal development during pregnancy."
2017,27951419,"Lithium induced, oxidative stress and related damages in testes and heart in male rats: The protective effects of Malva sylvestris extract.","Malva sylvestris is widely used in Mediterranean and European traditional medicine and ethnoveterinary for the treatment of various diseases. This study, carried out on male Wistar rats, evaluates the beneficial effects of Malva sylvestris extract upon lithium carbonate-induced damages in testes and heart. For this purpose, Malva sylvestris extract at a dose of 0.2g/kg was orally administrated, followed by 25mg/kg lithium carbonate (intraperitoneal injection, twice daily). Lithium carbonate treatment significantly (p<0.01) decreased the weight of testes, accessory sex organ and heart, sperm count and motility, and serum testosterone level. In addition, exposure to lithium carbonate significantly (p<0.01) increased lipid peroxidation level (LPO) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in testes and heart. Treatment with M. sylvestris extract affords substantial protection in testes and heart by altering all the parameters to near normal levels that were further confirmed by histological examination. The beneficial effect of M. Sylvestris extract in several organs could be attributed to the interaction of antioxidant components, such as complex polysaccharides, as confirmed by phytochemical analysis."
2005,15797624,Dietary garcinol inhibits 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced tongue carcinogenesis in rats.,"The effects of dietary feeding with a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, garcinol, isolated from Garcinia indica fruit rind on the development of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced oral carcinogenesis were investigated in male F344 rats. At 7 weeks of age, animals were given 4-NQO at 20 ppm in the drinking water for 8 weeks to induce tongue neoplasms. They also received the diets containing 100 or 500 ppm garcinol either during (for 10 weeks) or after (for 22 weeks) the carcinogen exposure. The other rats were given tap water without 4-NQO throughout the experiment, and fed garcinol (500 ppm)-containing diet or basal diet alone. At the end of the study (week 32), incidences of tongue neoplasms and preneoplastic lesions, cell proliferation activity in the normal-like tongue epithelium estimated by 5-bromodeoxyurideine (BrdU)-labeling index and cyclin D1-positive cell ratio, and immunohistochemical expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the tongue lesions were determined. Dietary garcinol significantly decreased the incidence and multiplicity of 4-NQO-induced tongue neoplasms and/or preneoplasms as compared to the control diet. Dietary administration of garcinol also significantly reduced the BrdU-labeling index and cyclin D1-positive cell ratio, suggesting reduction in cell proliferation activity in the tongue by garcinol. The COX-2 expression in the tongue lesions was also suppressed by feeding with garcinol. These results indicate that dietary administration of garcinol inhibited 4-NQO-induced tongue carcinogenesis through suppression of increased cell proliferation activity in the target tissues and/or COX-2 expression in the tongue lesions."
2017,28514831,"Hypericum perforatum extract attenuates behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical abnormalities in Aluminum chloride-induced Alzheimer's disease rats.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Aluminum, a neurotoxic metal, is considered as the pathological hallmark and contributing factor of AD. Hypericum perforatum extract (HPE) is a neuroprotective agent that can prevent neurodegenerative pathologies through antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and regulating neurotransmitter release in animal model of neuropathy. The present study aimed to identify the potential neuroprotective of HPE on AlCl3-induced AD rats. Rats were treated with AlCl3 for 90days to induce behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical similar to AD. From 31thday, the rats were treated with HPE for 60days. Our results showed HPE improved cognitive function in AlCl3-induced AD rats, and attenuated AlCl3-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and glutamic acid level as well as decreased in noradrenaline and dopamine level. In addition, HPE reversed AlCl3-induced hippocampal pathology including amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation (elevated Aβ42 level and amyloid plaques), oxidative stress (increased reactive oxygen species level and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level, decreased glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity) and neuroinflammatory (increased mRNA expressions of Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6, Tumor necrosis factor-α and major histocompatibility complex class II) in hippocampus of rats. Thus, HPE is conferred neuroprotection against AlCl3-induced AD like pathology."
2007,17110451,Vitamin K supplementation can improve stability of anticoagulation for patients with unexplained variability in response to warfarin.,"Patients receiving warfarin who have unstable control of anticoagulation have a significantly lower intake of dietary vitamin K compared with their stable counterparts. We hypothesized that supplementation with oral vitamin K would improve stability in patients with previously unstable control of anticoagulation. Seventy warfarin-treated patients with unstable anticoagulation control were randomly assigned in a double-blinded fashion to receive a daily amount of 150 mug oral vitamin K or placebo orally for 6 months. Measures of stability of anticoagulation control in the 6-month study period were compared with those in the 6 months immediately prior to it. Vitamin K supplementation resulted in a significantly greater decrease in standard deviation of international normalized ratio (INR) compared with placebo (-0.24 +/- 0.14 vs -0.11 +/- 0.18; P < .001) and a significantly greater increase in percentage time within target INR range (28% +/- 20% vs 15% +/- 20%; P < .01). Anticoagulation control improved in 33 of 35 patients receiving vitamin K supplementation; of these, 19 fulfilled our criteria for having stable control of anticoagulation. However, only 24 of 33 patients receiving placebo demonstrated some degree of improvement, with only 7 patients fulfilling the criteria for having stable control. Concomitant supplementation of vitamin K, perhaps through reducing the relative day-to-day variability in dietary vitamin K intake, can significantly improve anticoagulation control in patients with unexplained instability of response to warfarin."
2018,29523613,Flupirtine drug-induced liver injury in a patient developing acute liver failure.,"A patient is admitted with complaints of recent onset nausea, discomfort, jaundice and blood tests that reveal severe hepatitis. At the time, she had been taking medication with Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) for 6 months, and 6 weeks before this event, she took flupirtine maleate. A few days after being admitted, she developed encephalopathy progressing to acute liver failure (ALF) requiring unsuccessful liver transplantation. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In this context, while H. perforatum could interfere with other medication or trigger DILI itself, flupirtine appears to have triggered the DILI, given its liver toxicity capacity. DILI is one of the major ALF causes and can jeopardise patient's life. Accordingly, all efforts to reduce medication potentially hazardous to the liver are recommended."
2019,29958056,Fresh Fruit Juice of Opuntia dillenii Haw. Attenuates Acetic Acid-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of fresh fruit juice of Opuntia dillenii Haw. (FJOD) on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Fresh FJOD (2.5 and 5 ml/kg) and sulfasalazine (100 mg/kg) were given orally for seven consecutive days prior to colitis induction on the eighth day by intrarectal acetic acid (4% v/v) administration. Macroscopic, clinical activity scoring, biochemical, and histopathological examinations of colon were used to assess colonic damage. FJOD and sulfasalazine treatment significantly attenuated the macroscopic damage, clinical activity score, and wet weight of the colon when compared to disease control and further showed significantly reduced levels of myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and serum lactate dehydrogenase and enhanced colonic levels of reduced glutathione. The protective effect of FJOD may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in ulcerative colitis. The observed effects may be due to the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, and betalains in the fruit juice of Opuntia dillenii."
2016,26643336,Abalone Hemocyanin Blocks the Entry of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 into Cells: a Potential New Antiviral Strategy.,"A marine-derived compound, abalone hemocyanin, from Haliotis rubra was shown to have a unique mechanism of antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections. In vitro assays demonstrated the dose-dependent and inhibitory effect of purified hemocyanin against HSV-1 infection in Vero cells with a 50% effective dose (ED50) of 40 to 50 nM and no significant toxicity. In addition, hemocyanin specifically inhibited viral attachment and entry by binding selectively to the viral surface glycoproteins gD, gB, and gC, probably by mimicking their receptors. However, hemocyanin had no effect on postentry events and did not block infection by binding to cellular receptors for HSV. By the use of different mutants of gD and gB and a competitive heparin binding assay, both protein charge and conformation were shown to be the driving forces of the interaction between hemocyanin and viral glycoproteins. These findings also suggested that hemocyanin may have different motifs for binding to each of the viral glycoproteins B and D. The dimer subunit of hemocyanin with a 10-fold-smaller molecular mass exhibited similar binding to viral surface glycoproteins, showing that the observed inhibition did not require the entire multimer. Therefore, a small hemocyanin analogue could serve as a new antiviral candidate for HSV infections. "
2016,27717698,Asparagus adscendens root extract enhances cognition and protects against scopolamine induced amnesia: An in-silico and in-vivo studies.,"Asparagus adscendens Roxb. commonly known as safed musli and belonging to the Liliaceae family is cultivated mainly in Asian countries. In traditional medicine, safed musli is recommended as nerve tonic and remedy for memory impairment. The present study was aimed to evaluate nootropic and antiamnesic activities of Asparagus adscendens extract (AAE) using in silico and in vivo approach. Phytoconstituents of A. adscendens root reported in literature were subjected to in silico prediction using PASS and Pharmaexpert. The radial arm maze and passive shock avoidance paradigm were employed to evaluate nootropic activity. Subsequently, the anti-amnesic activity was evaluated in scopolamine induced amnesia model. To elucidate the mechanism of nootropic activity, the effect of AAE on the activities of acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes in the cortex and hippocampus of mice were also evaluated. In silico activity spectrum for all of A. adscendens phytoconstituents exhibited excellent prediction score for nootropic activity. Pretreatment with AAE (50, 100 & 200 mg/kg, i.p.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in working memory error, reference memory error and retrieval latency in radial arm maze and decrease in step down latency in passive shock avoidance paradigm were observed. Further, AAE significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress parameters in cortex and hippocampus of mice. Thus, in silico and in vivo results suggest that A. adscendens root may exert its nootropic activity through both anti-acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant activities."
2006,16284612,Vitamin K deficiency in children pre-bone marrow transplantation.,"This study examined the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in children pre-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Vitamin K status was measured by the PIVKA-II assay and prothrombin times. Blood samples were obtained before vitamin-containing TPN was infused. Results indicated that eight of 26 patients (31%) were vitamin K deficient; four cases were attributed to drug antagonism (phenytoin) and four were due to inadequate vitamin K intake, synthesis or malabsorption. Only one patient had a prolonged prothrombin time. Prothrombin time, in our study, is shown to be an ineffective screening tool to determine vitamin K status. All patients receiving phenytoin and chemotherapy are at increased risk of vitamin K deficiency."
2000,10837931,Implications of oxidative stress and inflammatory process in the cytotoxicity of capsaicin in human endothelial cells: lack of DNA strand breakage.,"Capsaicin, a natural product of Capsicum species is known to induce excitation of nociceptive terminals involved in pain perception. Nevertheless, it is utilized by topical application in humans, giving rise to blood capsaicin concentration up to 10-20 microM. The effect of capsaicin on human endothelial cells ECV 304 has been investigated. The cytotoxicity and inflammatory properties of capsaicin were evaluated by measuring the capsaicin-stimulated release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels (sICAM-1) into the culture medium; production of reactive oxygen species measured by quantification of lipoperoxidation in endothelial cell membranes; and genotoxicity measured using the comet assay and the DNA fragmentation assay. The concentration inhibiting protein synthesis by 50% after 24-h incubation was found to be 175 microM. Capsaicin induced an increase of sICAM-1 release into the culture medium at concentration >/=100 microM. Lipoperoxidation measured by malondialdehyde production increased at capsaicin concentration >/=200 microM. The comet test and DNA fragmentation assay clearly suggested that capsaicin does not induce significant DNA strand breaks within the range of concentrations used. Because the inflammatory reaction and lipid peroxidation may affect cellular functions and lead to cell death, the present data may have important implications for the possible health threats of capsaicin, specially in the case of unreasonable use of capsaicin preparations in pathological situations."
2010,20823575,Oral sustained release tablets of zidovudine using binary blends of natural and synthetic polymers.,"Oral sustained release matrix tablets of zidovudine (ZDV) were prepared using different types, proportions and blends of carbopol 71G (C71) and a plant gum obtained from Abelmoschus esculentus (AEG). The effect of various formulation factors like polymer proportion, polymer type and pH of the dissolution medium on the in vitro release of the drug was studied, using the half change technique, in 900 ml of dissolution medium, at 100 rpm. Release kinetics were analyzed using Zero-order, Higuchi's square-root and Ritger-Peppas' empirical equations. In vitro release performance as revealed by the time taken for 70% of the drug to be released (t70%), showed that the release rate decreased with increase in polymer proportion. Matrix tablets containing 10 and 20% AEG were found to exhibit immediate-release characteristics. Matrix tablets containing 30% AEG showed t70% value of 204 min and extended the release up to 5 h, while matrix tablets containing 30% carbopol showed t70% value of 234 min and extended the release up to 6 h. Three blends of AEG and C71 at the ratio of 1:2, 2:1 and 1:3 showed t70% values of 132, 312 and 102 min respectively and extended the release up to 8 h. Mathematical analysis of the release kinetics indicated that the nature of drug release from the matrix tablets followed Fickian and anomalous release. Drug release from matrix tablets of zidovudine containing blends of AEG and C71 demonstrates the advantage of blending a natural and synthetic polymer over single polymer use."

2007,17349083,"Effects of dietary soyabean meal, inulin and oxytetracycline on intestinal microbiota and epithelial cell stress, apoptosis and proliferation in the teleost Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).","Soyabean meal (SBM)-induced enteritis in the distal intestine of the teleost Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and other salmonids may be considered a model for diet-related mucosal disorders in other animals and man. The role of the intestinal microbiota in its pathogenesis was explored. Compared to diets containing fishmeal (FM) as the sole protein source, responses to extracted SBM or the prebiotic inulin, with or without oxytetracycline (OTC) inclusion, were studied following a 3-week feeding trial. Intestinal microbiota, organosomatic indices and histology, as well as immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and caspase-3-positive cells in the distal intestine, were studied. Distal intestine somatic indices (DISI) were higher in inulin and lower in SBM compared to FM-fed fish. The low DISI caused by SBM corresponded with histological changes, neither of which was affected by OTC, despite a significant decrease in adherent bacteria count. Image analysis of PCNA-stained sections showed a significant increase in the proliferative compartment length in SBM-fed fish, accompanied by apparent increases in reactivity to HSP70 and caspase-3 along the mucosal folds, indicating induction of cellular repair and apoptosis, respectively. Fish fed the SBM diet had higher total number as well as a more diverse population composition of adherent bacteria in the distal intestine. Thus SBM-induced enteritis is accompanied by induction of distal intestinal epithelial cell protective responses and changes in microbiota. Putative involvement of bacteria in the inflammatory response merits further investigation."
,2285225,Stimulation of granulocytic cell iodination by tannins and related compounds.,"Tannic acid stimulated the iodination (incorporation of radioactive iodine into an acid-insoluble fraction) of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells, without affecting the iodination of 9 other cultured cell lines. The stimulation of both PMN and HL-60 cells depended on incubation time and temperature, and was significantly suppressed by myeloperoxidase inhibitors. Among chemically defined natural polyphenols, condensed tannins (epicatechin gallate oligomers) and monomeric and oligomeric hydrolyzable tannins potently stimulated PMN iodination, whereas polyphenols of lower molecular weight (gallic acid, alkyl gallates, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, caffeic acid derivatives and licorice flavonoids) had much less activity. Various synthetic polyphenolic compounds structurally unrelated to tannins also stimulated PMN iodination depending upon their molecular weight, but to a slightly lesser extent. The results suggest that the stimulation activity of tannins and related polyphenols might depend more on their molecular weights than the number of hydroxyl groups on each benzene ring in the molecule, or the presence of sugars or hexahydroxydiphenoyl groups."
2011,21279466,A pilot study on zinc levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate zinc levels in three biological compartments (serum, erythrocytes and hair) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as compared to healthy individuals. Zinc levels in serum, erythrocytes and hair (in 74 patients with RA and 30 healthy individuals) were assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The mean hair zinc content was significantly lower in RA patients as compared to healthy individuals (p<0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation was observed in the RA patient group between the erythrocyte zinc levels and the prednisone dose (rs=0.48, p<0.05), and a negative correlation was found in this population between the serum zinc levels and disease duration (rs=-0.42, p<0.0006). In conclusion, it seems that hair may be a useful complementary study material for evaluating ""zinc status"" in rheumatoid arthritis patients."
2016,27614127,Salvianolic acid B improves vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats with blood glucose fluctuations via suppression of endothelial cell apoptosis.,"Vascular endothelial cell injury is an initial event in atherosclerosis. Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a main bioactive component in the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has vascular protective effect in diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated the effect of Sal B on vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats with blood glucose fluctuations and the possible mechanisms implicated. The results showed that diabetic rats developed marked endothelial dysfunction as exhibited by impaired acetylcholine induced vasodilation. Supplementation with Sal B resulted in an evident improvement of endothelial function. Phosphorylation (Ser 1177) of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly restored in Sal B treated diabetic rats, accompanied by an evident recovery of NO metabolites. Sal B effectively reduced vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, with Bcl-2 protein up-regulated and Bax protein down-regulated markedly. Treatment with Sal B led to an evident amelioration of oxidative stress in diabetic rats as manifested by enhanced antioxidant capacity and decreased contents of malondialdehyde in aortas. Protein levels of NOX2 and NOX4, two main isoforms of NADPH oxidase known as the major source of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature, were markedly decreased in Sal B treated groups. In addition, treatment with Sal B led to an evident decrease of serum lipids. Taken together, this study indicates that Sal B is capable of improving endothelial function in diabetic rats with blood glucose fluctuations, of which the underlying mechanisms might be related to suppression of endothelial cell apoptosis and stimulation of eNOS phosphorylation (Ser 1177)."
,16280656,"Safety of zinc gluconate glycine (Cold-Eeze) in a geriatric population: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.","Zinc gluconate glycine lozenges are an over-the-counter homeopathic remedy that significantly reduced the duration and severity of common colds in adults in 2 independent clinical trials. To evaluate the safety of zinc gluconate glycine lozenges in elderly individuals with 1 or more health conditions, with or without a cold. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial enrolled men and women between 60 and 91 years of age, who self-administered 1 zinc gluconate glycine or placebo lozenge every 3 to 4 hours for 6 days. One or more of the following conditions was present in the study population: arthritis, cancer, depression, heart disease, hypertension, lung disease, osteoporosis, prostate disease, and stroke. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 7 (+/-1 day) and 14 days. The safety evaluation considered physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications. Of 75 persons enrolled, 66 completed the study. Safety assessments demonstrated no clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Four participants taking zinc tablets and 3 participants taking placebo tablets reported mild adverse events. Of those participants taking zinc tablets, 6 adverse events were possibly related to the study product and 2 adverse events were probably related to the study product. Of those participants taking placebo tablets, 3 adverse events were reported that were possibly related to the study product. No serious or clinically significant adverse events were noted. Zinc gluconate glycine lozenges are safe and well tolerated by a geriatric population and are suitable for prophylactic or therapeutic use to reduce the duration or severity of the common cold."
2008,17761017,Low-calorie cranberry juice supplementation reduces plasma oxidized LDL and cell adhesion molecule concentrations in men.,"Elevated circulating concentrations of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) and cell adhesion molecules are considered to be relevant markers of oxidative stress and endothelial activation which are implicated in the development of CVD. On the other hand, it has been suggested that dietary flavonoid consumption may be cardioprotective through possible favourable impacts on LDL particle oxidation and endothelial activation. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of the daily consumption of low-calorie cranberry juice cocktail on plasma OxLDL, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin concentrations in men. Thirty men (mean age 51 (sd 10) years) were recruited and asked to consume increasing daily doses of cranberry juice cocktail (125, 250 and 500 ml/d) over three successive periods of 4 weeks. Plasma OxLDL and adhesion molecule concentrations were measured by ELISA before and after each phase. We noted a significant decrease in plasma OxLDL concentrations following the intervention (P < 0.0001). We also found that plasma ICAM-1 (P < 0.0001) and VCAM-1 (P < 0.05) concentrations decreased significantly during the course of the study. In summary, the present results show that daily cranberry juice cocktail consumption is associated with decreases in plasma OxLDL, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 concentrations in men."
2016,26800624,Synergistic anticancer activity of dietary tea polyphenols and bleomycin hydrochloride in human cervical cancer cell: Caspase-dependent and independent apoptotic pathways.,"Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is frequently used in the treatment of various cancers. Bleomycin causes serious adverse effects via antioxidant defense abnormalities against reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the current cervical cancer monodrug therapy strategy has failed to produce the expected outcomes; hence, combinational therapies are gaining great interest. Tea polyphenols are also effective antioxidative and chemo-preventive agents. However, the combined effect of tea polyphenol (TPP) and bleomycin (BLM) against cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, we focused on the potential of TPP on BLM anticancer activity against cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancer cells (SiHa) were treated with various concentrations of TPP, BLM and TPP combined with BLM (TPP-BLM), and their effects on cell growth, intracellular reactive oxygen species, poly-caspase activity, early apoptosis and the expression of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, Bcl-2 and p53 were assessed. The MTT assay revealed that the SiHa cells were less sensitive to growth inhibition by TPP treatment compared with both BLM and the combination therapy. Nuclear staining indicated that exposure to TPP-BLM increased the percentage of apoptotic nuclei compared with a mono-agent treatment. Caspase activation assay demonstrated that proportion of early and late apoptotic/secondary necrotic cells was higher in the cells treated with the combination therapy than in those treated with either TPP or BLM alone. The TPP-BLM treatment synergistically induced apoptosis through caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation, Bcl-2 upregulation and p53 overexpression. This study suggests that TPP-BLM may be used as an efficient antioxidant-based combination therapy for cervical cancer."
2019,30744871,Efficiency of combinative salicylic acid and chitosan preharvest-treatment on antioxidant and phytochemicals of ready to eat daikon sprouts during storage.,"Effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan and combinative SA and chitosan (SA + Chitosan) preharvest-treatments on bioactive compounds improvement of daikon sprouts during cold storage (5 ± 1 °C) were investigated. In preliminary experiment, 2.0 mM SA and 0.1% chitosan treatments were best concentration in improving antioxidant activity and bioactive compounds of the sprouts during storage. In the main experiment, the effects of SA + Chitosan treatment on visual appearance, antioxidant activity, phytochemicals and antioxidant enzymes of the sprouts were monitored during storage. Visual appearance and pigments contents did not significantly change throughout storage. SA + Chitosan treated sprouts contained total phenols, ascorbic acid, antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant activity higher that control. Compared to SA and chitosan, SA + Chitosan enhanced total phenols, ascorbic acid, catalase activity and free radical scavenging activity during storage. In conclusion, SA + Chitosan could be a good mean enhancing phytochemicals of daikon sprouts during cold storage."
2005,16094725,Hepatotoxicity of NONI juice: report of two cases.,NONI juice (Morinda citrifolia) is an increasingly popular wellness drink claimed to be beneficial for many illnesses. No overt toxicity has been reported to date. We present two cases of novel hepatotoxicity of NONI juice. Causality of liver injury by NONI juice was asses-sed. Routine laboratory tests and transjugular or percutaneous liver biopsy were performed. The first patient underwent successful liver transplantation while the second patient recovered spontaneously after cessation of NONI juice. A 29-year-old man with previous toxic hepatitis associated with small doses of paracetamol developed sub-acute hepatic failure following consumption of 1.5 L NONI juice over 3 wk necessitating urgent liver transplantation. A 62-year-old woman without evidence of previous liver disease developed an episode of self-limited acute hepatitis following consumption of 2 L NONI juice for over 3 mo. The most likely hepatotoxic components of Morinda citrifolia were anthraquinones. Physicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity of NONI juice.
2017,29092882,"Complementary feeding with cowpea reduces growth faltering in rural Malawian infants: a blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.","Background: Growth faltering is common in rural African children and is attributed to inadequate dietary intake and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED).Objective: We tested the hypothesis that complementary feeding with cowpea or common bean flour would reduce growth faltering and EED in 6-mo-old rural Malawians compared with the control group receiving a corn-soy blend.Design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in which children received daily feeding for 6 mo (200 kcal/d when 6-9 mo old and 300 kcal/d when 10-12 mo old). The primary outcomes were change in length-for-age z score (LAZ) and improvements in EED, as measured by percentage of lactulose excretion (%L). %L <0.2% was considered normal. Anthropometric measurements and %L through urine were compared between each legume group and the control group with Student's t test.Results: Of the 355 infants enrolled, 291 infants completed the trial, and 288 were breastfed throughout the duration of the study. Cowpea and common bean added 4.6-5.2 g protein/d and 4-5 g indigestible carbohydrate/d to the diet. LAZ and weight-for-height z score were reduced in all 3 groups from 6 to 12 mo of age. The changes in LAZ [mean (95% CI)] for the cowpea, common bean, and control groups from 6 to 9 mo were -0.14 (-0.24, -0.04), -0.27 (-0.38, -0.16), and -0.27 (-0.35, -0.19), respectively. LAZ was reduced less in infants receiving cowpea than in those receiving control food from 6 to 9 mo (P = 0.048). The absolute value of %L did not differ between the dietary groups at 9 mo of age (mean ± SD: 0.30 ± 0.43, 0.23 ± 0.21, and 0.26 ± 0.31 for cowpea, common bean, and control, respectively), nor did the change in %L from 6 to 9 mo.Conclusion: Addition of cowpea to complementary feeding in Malawian infants resulted in less linear growth faltering. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02472262."
2019,31480473,Predictive Modeling of Suitable Habitats for Cinnamomum Camphora (L.) Presl Using Maxent Model under Climate Change in China.,"Rapid changes in global climate exert tremendous pressure on forest ecosystems. Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl is a multi-functional tree species, and its distribution and growth are also affected by climate warming. In order to realize its economic value and ecological function, it is necessary to explore the impact of climate change on its suitable habitats under different scenarios. In this experiment, 181 geographical distribution data were collected, and the MaxEnt algorithm was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats. To complete the simulation, we selected two greenhouse gas release scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and also three future time periods, 2025s, 2055s, and 2085s. The importance of environmental variables for modeling was evaluated by jackknife test. Our study found that accumulated temperature played a key role in the distribution of camphor trees. With the change of climate, the area of suitable range will increase and continue to move to the northwest of China. These findings could provide guidance for the plantation establishment and resource protection of camphor in China."
2018,29278432,Tanshinones that selectively block the collagenase activity of cathepsin K provide a novel class of ectosteric antiresorptive agents for bone.,"Attempts to generate active site-directed cathepsin K (CatK) inhibitors for the treatment of osteoporosis have failed because of side effects. We have previously shown that an ectosteric tanshinone CatK inhibitor isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza blocked, selectively, the collagenase activity of CatK, without affecting the active site and demonstrated its bone-preserving activity in vivo. Here, we have characterize the antiresorptive potential of other tanshinones, which may provide a scaffold for side effect-free CatK inhibitors.Thirty-one tanshinones were tested for their activity against CatK in enzymic and cell-based assays. The inhibitory potency against triple helical and fibrillar collagen degradation was determined in enzymic assays, by scanning electron microscopy and mechanical strength measurements. Human osteoclast assays were used to determine the effects of the inhibitors on bone resorption, its reversibility and osteoclastogenesis. Binding sites were characterized by molecular docking.Twelve compounds showed highly effective anti-collagenase activity and protected collagen against destruction and mechanical instability without inhibiting the hydrolysis of non-collagenous substrates. Six compounds were highly effective in osteoclast bone resorption assays with IC50 values of <500 nM. None of these tanshinones had effects on cell viability, reversibility of bone resorption inhibition and osteoclastogenesis. The core pharmacophore of the tanshinones appears to be the three-ring system with either a para- or ortho-quinone entity.Our study identified several potent ectosteric antiresorptive CatK inhibitors from the medicinal plant, S. miltiorrhiza, which may avoid side effects seen with active site-directed inhibitors in clinical trials."
2013,23343619,Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by a plant-derived dihydroisosteviol in human intestinal epithelial cell.,"Our previous study has shown that dihydroisosteviol (DHIS), a derivative of stevioside isolated from Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni), inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated transepithelial chloride secretion across monolayers of human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells and prevents cholera toxin-induced intestinal fluid secretion in mouse closed loop models. In this study, we aimed to investigate a mechanism by which DHIS inhibits CFTR activity. Apical chloride current measurements in Fisher rat thyroid cells stably transfected with wild-type human CFTR (FRT-CFTR cells) and T84 cells were used to investigate mechanism of CFTR inhibition by DHIS. In addition, effect of DHIS on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation was investigated using Western blot analysis. Surprisingly, it was found that DHIS failed to inhibit CFTR-mediated apical chloride current in FRT-CFTR cells. In contrast, DHIS effectively inhibited CFTR-mediated apical chloride current induced by a cell permeable cAMP analog CPT-cAMP and a direct CFTR activator genistein in T84 cell monolayers. Interestingly, this inhibitory effect of DHIS on CFTR was significantly (p<0.05) reduced by pretreatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. AICAR, a known AMPK activator, was able to inhibit CFTR activity in both FRT-CFTR and T84 cells. Western blot analysis showed that DHIS induced AMPK activation in T84 cells, but not in FRT-CFTR cells. Our results indicate that DHIS inhibits CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in T84 cells, in part, by activation of AMPK activity. DHIS therefore represents a novel candidate of AMPK activators."
2014,24347241,Therapeutic glucocorticoid administration alters the diurnal pattern of dehydroepiandrosterone.,"Significant alteration in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function has been demonstrated in patients after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, but its impact on the circadian rhythm of steroid hormones has never been investigated. This study examined the effects of short-term prednisone administration on the diurnal patterns of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone. Saliva samples were collected from 11 healthy, physically active, male volunteers for DHEA and testosterone analysis, as follows: every 4 h from 0800 to 2000 h on 2 control days without medication, and after 1 week of oral therapeutic prednisone treatment (60 mg daily) (days 0-3). Overall, a diurnal decline in the two steroid hormones was observed on the control days. After short-term glucocorticoid administration, DHEA concentrations were significantly decreased with a complete disappearance of the DHEA diurnal pattern, which lasted 2 days post-treatment. No glucocorticoid effect was observed for testosterone. The results indicate that short-term prednisone treatment affects the circadian pattern of saliva DHEA but not testosterone in healthy active volunteers. Further studies are necessary to determine whether this alteration in DHEA circadian pattern has clinical consequences in patients with chronic glucocorticoid therapy."
2017,28950660,Whey protein isolate enrichment attenuates manganese-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster: Relevance to Parkinson's disease.,"Currently, much emphasis is being laid on understanding the role of nutrition to alleviate neurodegenerative conditions. Here we employed a Drosophila model to test the hypothesis that Whey protein isolate (WPI) enrichment can attenuate Manganese (Mn) induced locomotor phenotype, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Mn exposure (0-30mM) to young (8-10d old) males/females and aged (30-35d old) males elicited a concentration-dependent temporal mortality and locomotor deficits. In general, females and aged males were more susceptible than young males. Mn exposure (5-15mM, 5d) among male flies, besides induction of oxidative stress (elevated levels of MDA and protein carbonyls with a concomitant decrease in glutathione levels), caused significant perturbations in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial complexes. In the co-exposure paradigm, WPI fortification (0.25-0.5%) markedly ameliorated Mn-induced locomotor phenotype, mortality, oxidative stress and restored the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, cholinergic function, and dopamine levels. In a satellite study, flies given prophylactic treatment (10d) with WPI were more resistant(evidenced by a lower incidence of mortality and locomotor deficits) to an acute MPP+ challenge suggesting its potential to enhance survival pathways. Collectively, these data suggest the potential of WPI enrichment to attenuate Mn-induced toxic manifestations in the Drosophila model. Based on these findings, we propose that fortification of diet with WPI offers a useful approach to alleviate Mn-induced toxic manifestations and neuronal dysfunctions in humans, especially in occupational settings."
2004,15003921,"Effects of convenience rice congee supplemented diets on guinea pig whole animal and gut growth, caecal digesta SCFA and in vitro ileal contractility.","The aim of the study was to feed convenience baby food brown rice (BC) and white rice (WC) congee diets compared to egg custard (EC) and baked bean (BB) diets to newborn guinea pig pups. Diets were isocaloric and formulated to contain equal macronutrient content of carbohydrate, protein, fat and fibre. Diets were supplemented with essential nutrients, fruit and vegetables and decrementally with standard chow for palatability. We investigated the acceptability of the diets and specifically whether the different natural fibre content of these diets could influence whole animal and small intestinal growth, caecal digesta properties and specifically in vitro ileal contractility. After 8 weeks of feeding, the mean body weight of WC group was significantly lower than the BB group. WC group had lower small intestine weight than both BC group and BB group resulting in lower small intestine density compared to BB group. Caecal digesta pH and total short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration were similar. However, butyrate was higher in the BB group compared to the other diets. Contractility studies revealed a small but significantly higher voltage was required to initiate ileal contraction of BC group compared to both the EC and BB groups. All dietary groups responded similarly to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and 8-iso-PGE(2). There were no differences on inhibition of electrically-driven contraction by morphine or epinephrine. The newborn guinea pig model was an effective system for testing, with limitations, supplemented convenience baby foods with variable natural fibre content that demonstrated significant effects on animal growth, caecal digesta SCFA and intestinal contractility."
2007,17479252,Mercuric dichloride induces DNA damage in human salivary gland tissue cells and lymphocytes.,"Amalgam is still one of the most frequently used dental filling materials. However, the possible adverse effects especially that of the mercuric component have led to continued controversy. Considering that mercury may be released from amalgam fillings into the oral cavity and also reach the circulating blood after absorption and resorption, it eventually may contribute to tumorigenesis in a variety of target cells. The present investigation focuses on genotoxic effects below a cytotoxic dose level of mercuric dichloride (HgCl(2)) in human samples of salivary glands and lymphocytes to elucidate a possible role in tumor initiation. DNA migration due to single strand breaks, alkali labile sites and incomplete excision repair was quantified with the aid of the single cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The concepts of Olive Tail Moment, percentage of DNA in the Tail and Tail Length were used as measures of DNA damage. To control for cytotoxic effects, the trypan blue exclusion test was applied. Human samples of the parotid salivary gland and lymphocytes of ten donors were exposed to HgCl(2)concentrations from 1 to 50 microM. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as controls. Increasing dose-dependent DNA migration could be demonstrated after exposure to HgCl(2) in cells of the salivary glands and lymphocytes. In both cell types a significant increase in DNA migration could be shown starting from HgCl(2)concentrations of 5 microM in comparison to the negative control. The viability of the cell systems was not affected except at the highest concentration (50 microM) tested. These data indicate genotoxic effects of mercuric dichloride in human salivary glands and lymphocytes at concentrations not leading to cytotoxic effects or cell death. Consequently, a contributory role in oral salivary gland tumor initiation warrants further investigation."
2019,31431698,Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for chimerism-based tolerance.,"High-dose cyclophosphamide given post-transplant (PTCy) successfully enables tolerance induction in HLA-mismatched related blood or marrow transplantation (haploBMT) manifested by low rates of graft failure, severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. When proceeded by nonmyeloablative conditioning, PTCy has also been associated with a low incidence of nonrelapse mortality. The safety of this platform has garnered interest in expanding its use to non-malignant indications for allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT). After success in a preliminary Phase I/II trial, use of a PTCy-based haploBMT platform is now being explored in a large Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) study for sickle cell disease. These emerging data in patients with hemoglobinopathies provided the rationale for exploring the use of PTCy in combined solid organ and BM transplantation as a means of tolerance induction through donor hematopoietic chimerism with a goal to obviate the need for a lifetime of immunosuppression. Several case reports, series, and small clinical trials have now been published of combined solid organ and alloBMT in patients with hematologic malignancies who had organ failure that would have been preclusive of alloBMT in the absence of solid organ transplantation. Here we will review the pre-clinical and clinical studies supporting the use of PTCy for chimerism-based tolerance induction."
1997,18372520,Antimutagenic activity of anthocyanins isolated from Aronia melanocarpa fruits.,"Anthocyanins belong to the flavonoid family and are ubiquitous in plants, especially in flower petals and fruit peels. We established that anthocyanins isolated from fruits of Aronia melanocarpa markedly inhibited the mutagenic activity of benzo(a)pyrene and 2-amino fluorene in the Ames test. In the Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs) test with human blood-derived lymphocytes cultured in vitro, a significant decrease of SCEs frequency induced by benzo(a)pyrene was observed in the presence of anthocyanins. In the case of mitomycin C the effect of anthocyanins on SCEs frequency was smaller but still noticeable. Anthocyanins markedly inhibited the generation and release of superoxide radicals by human granulocytes. The results suggest that the antimutagenic influence of anthocyanins is exerted mainly by their free-radicals scavenging action as well as by the inhibition of enzymes activating promutagens and converting mutagens to the DNA-reacting derivatives. These preliminary data seem to be important in the aspect of a possible antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic potency of anthocyanins commonly present in fruits and vegetables."
1984,6731999,Diagnostic value of urinary dialkyl phosphate measurement in goats exposed to diazinon.,"Recognition of exposure to diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, was studied in goats. Urine and milk dialkyl phosphate concentrations (DETP; O,O-diethyl phosphorothionate) and blood cholinesterase activity (ChE) and diazinon concentrations were measured. Groups (n = 3 each) given (orally) diazinon at doses of 0.5 mg/kg for 7 days (small dose) or 5 mg/kg for 7 days (large dose) were compared with goats acutely exposed to single doses of 150 mg/kg (n = 1) or 700 mg/kg (n = 1). Clinical signs of intoxication occurred only in the goat given the 700 mg/kg dose. Urinary DETP concentrations were sensitive indicators of diazinon exposure and provided quantitative differences between small, large, and acute dosage exposures. Milk DETP concentrations were not detected. Cholinesterase measurement was useful only in the acute exposure studies. Whole blood diazinon concentrations were detected only in goats given the large dose for 7 days and acutely exposed. Measurement of urinary DETP was a sensitive aid for recognition of diazinon exposure."
2003,12734644,High-dose clastogenic activity of aniline in the rat bone marrow and its relationship to the carcinogenicity in the spleen of rats.,"To clarify the question of clastogenicity of aniline in rats two studies were performed: a bone marrow micronucleus test and a bone marrow metaphase test. In the micronucleus test aniline (as aniline hydrochloride) was administered to groups of seven male PVG rats at single oral doses of 0, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg body weight. Bone marrow was obtained 24 and 48 h after oral treatment. Smears of bone marrow were stained with acridine orange and erythrocytes were examined for the presence of micronuclei. Animals receiving cyclophosphamide (1x7.5 mg/kg) served as positive controls. Clinical signs observed in animals dosed at 300 mg/kg and above included cyanosis, light brown coloured urine and cold to touch. Small, but statistically significant and dose-related increases in the incidence of micronulei over the vehicle control values were observed at the 24-h sampling time only. Cyclophosphamide induced a significant and comparably much higher increase in micronuclei than aniline. In the bone marrow metaphase test aniline (as aniline hydrochloride) was administered to groups of seven male PVG rats at single oral dose levels of 0, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg body weight. Bone marrow was sampled 18 and 30 h after dosing. A group treated with cyclophosphamide (1x40 mg/kg) served as positive control. A small increase in the percentage of aberrant cells above solvent control values was recorded in one rat at 400 mg/kg and four rats at 500 mg/kg at the 18-h sampling time only. The positive control cyclophosphamide induced a much higher rate of aberrant cells in all animals. Several lines of evidences are presented against a causal relationship between the clastogenic activity in male PVG rats at 400 and 500 mg/kg and the carcinogenicity in the spleen of Fischer 344 rats starting at 30 mg/kg in males. Among these are the dose-response relationship of the tumour incidence, the close correlation between degree of spleen damage and tumour induction, the lack of carcinogenic effects in mice even at higher dose levels, or in rats at dose levels inducing only slight haematotoxicity and spleen toxicity, and the available data on the mode of action of other chemicals inducing spleen tumours."
2010,20628153,Superior outcomes associated with complete response in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated with nonintensive therapy: analysis of the phase 3 VISTA study of bortezomib plus melphalan-prednisone versus melphalan-prednisone.,"The phase 3 Velcade as Initial Standard Therapy in Multiple Myeloma: Assessment with Melphalan and Prednisone study in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients ineligible for high-dose therapy demonstrated that bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) was superior to melphalan-prednisone across all efficacy end points. We assessed the prognostic impact of response on time-to-event parameters in the intent-to-treat population. Patients received nine 6-week cycles of treatment. Time to progression, time to next therapy, and treatment-free interval were associated with quality of response. When European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria were used, complete response (CR) was associated with significantly longer time to progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.45, P = .004), time to next therapy (HR = 0.46, P = .0004), and treatment-free interval (HR = 0.38, P < .0001) versus partial response, but there was no significant difference in overall survival (HR = 0.87, P = .54); similar differences were seen with CR versus very good partial response by uniform criteria. Quality of response improved with prolonged VMP treatment, with 28% of CRs achieved during cycles 5-9. CR duration appeared similar among patients with ""early"" (cycles 1-4) and ""late"" CRs (cycles 5-9) and among patients receiving 9 versus < 9 cycles of bortezomib within VMP. These results highlight that CR is an important treatment goal and support prolonged VMP therapy to achieve maximal response. This study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00111319."
2019,30937879,"Ginkgo biloba Extract (EGb761), Cholinesterase Inhibitors, and Memantine for the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: A Network Meta-Analysis.","Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine have been reported to provide modest benefits for cognition and aspects of functioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761), a phytomedicine, is widely used and expected to be well-tolerated. A few trials have compared EGb761 with ChEIs, and the results were inconclusive.A network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic benefits and tolerability of EGb761, three ChEIs (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine), and memantine in mild-to-moderate AD patients.Electronic databases were searched through 30 June 2017. We included randomized double-blinded trials with a minimum treatment duration of 22 weeks for EGb761 240 mg/day and 12 weeks for ChEIs or memantine. The study patients included AD or probable AD patients without other types of dementia or neurological disorders. Cognition, function, and behavior symptoms were compared between treatments using the standardized mean difference (SMD). Clinical global impression, treatment discontinuation, and adverse events were compared between treatments using the relative risk (RR). Statistical pooling of the individual trial results was conducted using a frequentist approach. The probability of being the best for a treatment was estimated using surface under the cumulative ranking.EGb761 and memantine showed no therapeutic benefits in all study outcomes. For cognition, all ChEIs were significantly better than placebo (SMD from - 0.52 to - 0.26), and galantamine was better than rivastigmine in the oral and patch forms, EGb761, and memantine (SMD [95% confidence interval (CI)]: - 0.22 [- 0.40 to - 0.05]; - 0.26 [- 0.45 to - 0.07]; - 0.34 [- 0.56 to -  0.12]; and - 0.42 [- 0.71 to - 0.13], respectively). Compared to placebo, galantamine, the rivastigmine patch, and oral rivastigmine provided modest functional benefits (SMD, from 0.21 to 0.24), and galantamine provided behavioral benefits (SMD [95% CI]: - 0.15 [- 0.26 to - 0.04]). All ChEIs provided a better improvement in clinical global impression than placebo (RR from 1.20 to 1.69). The global impression ratings were more improved with donepezil than with galantamine (RR [95% CI]: 1.40 [1.09-1.80]) or with EGb761 (RR [95% CI]: 1.40 [1.06-1.85]), with a 96% probability of donepezil being more effective than the other study agents. Rivastigmine in oral and patch forms, galantamine, and donepezil had a higher risk of being discontinued than placebo (RR [95% CI]: 2.14 [1.49-3.06]; 2.04 [1.30-3.20]; 1.79 [1.28-2.49]; 1.49 [1.03-2.17], respectively). Discontinuation of EGb761 was not statistically lower than that of the ChEIs, in which donepezil had the lowest probability (38%) of being discontinued.EGb761 and memantine showed no treatment benefits compared to placebo and ChEIs. Galantamine provided the highest beneficial effect on cognition and behavioral symptoms. Donepezil provided a better clinical global impression and tolerability than the other ChEIs and EGb761, with a similar benefit for cognition as galantamine."
2005,15930595,Determination of relative bioavailability of zinc in a petit suisse cheese using weight gain and bone zinc content in rats as markers.,"The aim of the study was to determine the relative bioavailability of zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine in a Petit Suisse cheese from an infant dessert. Weight gain and bone zinc content were the nutritional responses evaluated for the diets of different zinc content: 2 ppm (basal) and 5, 10, and 30 ppm from zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine and zinc sulfate. Nonlinear regression analysis of the fitted curves for weight gain determined a relative zinc bioavailability of 100% for the Y<I->max ratio and 96% for Ymax/t1/2 ratio for zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine (R2=0.7996 for zinc sulfate and 0.8665 for zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine). The slope ratio analysis from linear regression of femur zinc determined a relative zinc bioavailability of 93% for zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine (R<I+>2=0.8693 for zinc sulfate and 0.8307 for zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine). Zinc gluconate stabilized with glycine has similar bioavailability as zinc sulfate in a Petit Suisse cheese nutritional matrix, with the advantage that the stabilized compound does not modify the sensorial characteristics of the fortified cheese."
2019,30713252,"Effect of Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum selloi, and Rosmarinic Acid on Cerebral Vascular Damage in a Chronic Hypertension Model.","The main objective of treatment against hypertension is not only to reduce blood pressure levels, but also to reduce vascular risk in general. In the present work, administering angiotensin II (AGII; 0.2 µg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 12 weeks) activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which caused an increase in corticosterone levels, as well as in proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) and macrophage chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 4 (IL-4)). On observing the behavior in the different models, an anxiogenic effect (elevated plus maze (EPM)) and cognitive impairment (water Morris maze (WMM)) was observed in animals with AGII. By administering organic extracts from Ocimum basilicum (Oba-EtOAc) and Ocimum selloi (Ose-EtOAc), and some doses of rosmarinic acid (RA) (6 weeks per os (p.o.)), the damage caused by AGII was stopped by re-establishing corticosterone serum levels and by decreasing the proinflammatory cytokines and MCP-1."
2007,17147953,Resveratrol protects dopaminergic neurons in midbrain slice culture from multiple insults.,"Increasing lines of evidence show that resveratrol, a polyphenol compound contained in several dietary products, exhibits cytoprotective actions. Notably, resveratrol activates sirtuin family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases implicated in regulation of various cellular processes including gene transcription, DNA repair and apoptosis. Here we examined neuroprotective effect of resveratrol on dopaminergic neurons in organotypic midbrain slice culture. Resveratrol and quercetin, another sirtuin-activating polyphenol, prevented the decrease of dopaminergic neurons and the increase of propidium iodide uptake into slices induced by a dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)). Resveratrol also provided concentration-dependent neuroprotective effects against sodium azide, a mitochondrial complex IV inhibitor, and thrombin (EC number 3.4.21.5), a microglia-activating agent. Sirtuin inhibitors such as nicotinamide and sirtinol did not attenuate the protective effect of resveratrol against MPP(+) cytotoxicity. Instead, we found that resveratrol prevented accumulation of reactive oxygen species, depletion of cellular glutathione, and cellular oxidative damage induced by MPP(+), suggesting involvement of antioxidative properties in the neuroprotective action of resveratrol. On the other hand, resveratrol as well as a sirtuin activator NAD inhibited dopaminergic neurotoxicity of a DNA alkylating agent, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Moreover, MNNG-induced increase in acetylation of p53, a representative target of sirtuin deacetylase activity, was suppressed by resveratrol. These results indicate that resveratrol can exert neuroprotective actions in dopaminergic neurons. Either antioxidative activity or sirtuin-activating potential may play an important role in the neuroprotectice actions of resveratrol against different kinds of insults."
2010,20196892,"Oral sensitivity to fatty acids, food consumption and BMI in human subjects.","Fatty acids are the chemical moieties that are thought to stimulate oral nutrient sensors, which detect the fat content of foods. In animals, oral hypersensitivity to fatty acids is associated with decreased fat intake and body weight. The aims of the present study were to investigate oral fatty acid sensitivity, food selection and BMI in human subjects. The study included two parts; study 1 established in thirty-one subjects (29 (sem 1.4) years, 22.8 (sem 0.5) kg/m2) taste thresholds using 3-AFC (3-Alternate Forced Choice Methodology) for oleic, linoleic and lauric acids, and quantified oral lipase activity. During study 2, fifty-four subjects (20 (sem 0.3) years, 21.5 (sem 0.4) kg/m2) were screened for oral fatty acid sensitivity using oleic acid (1.4 mm), and they were defined as hypo- or hypersensitive via triplicate triangle tests. Habitual energy and macronutrient intakes were quantified from 2 d diet records, and BMI was calculated from height and weight. Subjects also completed a fat ranking task using custard containing varying amounts (0, 2, 6 and 10 %) of fat. Study 1 reported median lipase activity as 2 mumol fatty acids/min per l, and detection thresholds for oleic, linoleic and lauric acids were 2.2 (sem 0.1), 1.5 (sem 0.1) and 2.6 (sem 0.3) mm. Study 2 identified twelve hypersensitive subjects, and hypersensitivity was associated with lower energy and fat intakes, lower BMI (P < 0.05) and an increased ability to rank custards based on fat content (P < 0.05). Sensitivity to oleic acid was correlated to performance in the fat ranking task (r 0.4, P < 0.05). These data suggest that oral fatty acid hypersensitivity is associated with lower energy and fat intakes and BMI, and it may serve as a factor that influences fat consumption in human subjects."
2009,19344418,Prior rituximab correlates with less acute graft-versus-host disease and better survival in B-cell lymphoma patients who received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.,"Prior therapy with rituximab might attenuate disparate histocompatibility antigen presentation by B cells, thus decreased the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and improved survival. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the outcomes of 435 B-cell lymphoma patients who received allogeneic transplantation from 1999 to 2004 in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database: 179 subjects who received rituximab within 6 months prior to transplantation (RTX cohort) and 256 subjects who did not receive RTX within 6 months prior to transplantation (No-RTX cohort). The RTX cohort had a significantly lower incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) [relative risk (RR) = 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-1.0; P = 0.05], lower acute grade II-IV (RR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = 0.03) and III-IV GVHD (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.91; P = 0.02). There was no difference in the risk of chronic GVHD, disease progression or relapse. Progression-free survival (PFS) (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92; P = 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (RR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86; P = 0.004) were significantly better in the RTX cohort. Prior RTX therapy correlated with less acute GVHD, similar chronic GVHD, less TRM, better PFS and OS."
2015,25557052,Effect of grapefruit juice on the bioactivation of prasugrel.,"The P2Y12 inhibitor prasugrel is a prodrug, which is activated after its initial hydrolysis partly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Grapefruit juice, a strong inactivator of intestinal CYP3A4, greatly reduces the activation and antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of grapefruit juice on prasugrel.In a randomized crossover study, seven healthy volunteers ingested 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water three times daily for 4 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 10 mg dose of prasugrel with an additional 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water. Plasma concentrations of prasugrel metabolites and the antiplatelet effect were measured.Grapefruit juice increased the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞)) of the primary, inactive metabolite of prasugrel to 164% of the control value (95% confidence interval 122-220%, P = 0.008), without a significant effect on its peak plasma concentration (C(max)). The C(max) and AUC(0-∞) of the secondary, active metabolite were decreased to 51% (95% confidence interval 32-84%, P = 0.017) and 74% of the control value (95% confidence interval 60-91%, P = 0.014) by grapefruit juice (P < 0.05). The average platelet inhibition, assessed with the VerifyNow® method at 0-24 h after prasugrel intake, was 5 percentage points (95% confidence interval 1-10 percentage points) lower in the grapefruit juice phase than in the water phase (P = 0.034).Grapefruit juice reduces the bioactivation of prasugrel, but this has only a limited effect on the antiplatelet effect of prasugrel."
2016,26511097,Oatmeal porridge: impact on microflora-associated characteristics in healthy subjects.,"Oatmeal porridge has been consumed for centuries and has several health benefits. We aimed to investigate the effect of oatmeal porridge on gut microflora functions. A total of ten healthy subjects ingested 60 g oatmeal porridge daily for 1 week. The following microflora-associated characteristics were assessed before and after the intervention: intestinal gas production following lactulose ingestion, faecal excretion of SCFA and faecal levels of urease and β-galactosidase. In addition, rectal levels of PGE2 were measured. Microbial fermentation as evaluated by intestinal gas production and excretion of SCFA did not change significantly following the dietary intervention. However, faecal levels of β-galactosidase and urease decreased after eating oatmeal porridge (P=0·049 and 0·031, respectively). Host inflammatory state, as measured by rectal levels of PGE2, also decreased, but the change was not significant (P=0·168). The results suggest that oatmeal porridge has an effect on gut microbial functions and may possess potential prebiotic properties that deserve to be investigated further. "
,9137455,"Effects of orally administered capsaicin, the principal component of capsicum fruits, on the in vitro metabolism of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine NNK in hamster lung and liver microsomes.","Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is the principal component in Capsicum fruits consumed worldwide as a food additive. Capsaicin is known for its hot, pungent qualities. The tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is viewed as an important etiological factor in the causation of human lung cancer. In our study, a single oral dose of capsaicin administered by oral gavage at 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight to male Syrian golden hamsters altered the in vitro metabolism of NNK by liver and lung microsomes. The most significant effect was on the inhibition of alpha-carbon hydroxylation. The orally administered capsaicin inhibited the formation of keto aldehyde (methylating pathway) and the formation of keto alcohol (pyridyloxobutylating pathway) in lung microsomes except for microsomes from animals receiving 10 mg/kg capsaicin 24 h post-treatment. In contrast, capsaicin inhibited only the methylating pathway in liver microsomal metabolism of NNK. This effect persisted at 24 h post-treatment. Since it is reported that the pyridyloxobutylating pathway enhances the effects of the more damaging methylating pathway in the metabolism of NNK (reference 25), our results suggest that any potentially chemopreventive action of orally administered capsaicin may be greater toward NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis than toward NNK-induced liver tumorigenesis."
2003,12445672,Anticancer and antiinflammatory activities of cucurbitacins from Cucurbita andreana.,"Bioassay-guided purification of an extract of Cucurbita andreana fruits yielded cucurbitacins B (1), D (2), E (3), and I (4). These cucurbitacins were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the growth of human colon (HCT-116), breast (MCF-7), lung (NCI-H460), and central nervous system (CNS) (SF-268) cancer cell lines, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes and on lipid peroxidation. Inhibitory activities of cucurbitacins B (1), D (2), E (3) and I (4), respectively, were for colon 81.5, 80.4, 77, and 65% at 0.4 microM, breast 87, 78, 66.5, and 12% at 0.4 microM, lung 96, 43, 37 and 2% at 0.1 microM and CNS 92, 25, 24 and 4% at 0.05 microM. Adriamycin (doxorubicin) was used as a positive control, which showed 64, 47, 45 and 71% inhibition of HCT-116 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), NCI-H460 (lung) and SF-268 (CNS) cell lines, respectively, at 0.3 x 10(-5) M. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 inhibited the COX-2 enzyme by 32, 29, 35, and 27%, respectively, at 100 microg/ml. However these compounds did not inhibit the COX-1 enzyme at this concentration. Ibuprofen, naproxen and vioxx, commercial antiinflammatory drugs, were tested as controls for the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes at concentrations of 2.1, 2.5 and 1.67 microg/ml, respectively. Ibuprofen and naproxen exhibited 59 and 95% COX-1, and 53 and 79% COX-2 inhibitory activities, respectively. Vioxx showed specific COX-2 inhibition by 71%. Also, cucurbitacins 1 and 4 inhibited lipid peroxidation by 59 and 23%, respectively, at 100 microg/ml."
2006,17142978,Protective effect of the ethanol extract of the roots of Brassica rapa on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in LLC-PK1 cells and rats.,"A study was conducted to determine whether the ethanol extract of the roots of Brassica rapa (EBR) ameliorates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in terms of oxidative stress, as characterized by lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and glutathione (GSH) depletion in LLC-PK1 cells. Pretreatment of cells with EBR prevented cisplatin-induced decreases in cell viability and cellular GSH content. The effect of EBR was then investigated in rats given EBR for 14 d before cisplatin administration. A single dose of cisplatin (7 mg/kg, i.p.) caused kidney damage manifested by an elevation in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and urine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Also, renal tissue from cisplatin-treated rats showed a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and in the activities of aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase (XO). Moreover, a significant decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was observed in cisplatin-treated rats versus saline-treated normal group. In contrast, rats given EBR showed lower blood levels of BUN and creatinine, and of urinary LDH. Moreover, EBR prevented the rise of MDA production and the induction of AO and XO activities. This extract also recovered the reduced activities of GPx, SOD and CAT. Taken together, our data indicate that the ethanol extract of the roots of Brassica rapa (EBR) has a protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity because it attenuates oxidative stress."
2010,20595790,[Combined estrogenic activity of soybean extract used in a dietary supplement and ethinyl estradiol].,"We examined the combined estrogenic activity of soybean extract used in a dietary supplement and ethinyl estradiol (EE) contained in an oral contraceptive. Olive oil (control), soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g/kg corresponding to doses of total isoflavone of 0.83 or 83 mg/kg respectively), EE (1 or 10 microg/kg), and soybean extract+EE were administered to ovariectomized CD-1 mice by oral gavage for 4 consecutive days. Soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g/kg) and EE (1 microg/kg) did not increase the relative uterine weight. The relative uterine weight of the soybean extract (0.0036 or 0.36 g/kg)+EE (10 microg/kg) group was significantly higher than that of the control. The relative uterine weight of the soybean extract (0.36 g/kg)+EE (10 microg/kg) group was also significantly higher than that of the EE (10 microg/kg) group. Soybean extract showed estrogenic activity for human estrogen receptor (hER)-alpha and -beta. Coadministration of EE with soybean extract increased the estrogenic activity for hER-alpha and -beta."
1983,6340694,"Survey of plant inhibitors of polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase, pancreatic elastase, cathepsin G, cathepsin B, Hageman factor fragments, and other serine proteinases.","Various flower bulbs and vegetable and legume seeds were tested for inhibitors of polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase, pancreatic elastase, cathepsin G, cathepsin B, trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, Hageman factor fragments, plasma kallikrein, and plasmin. Calla bulbs contained a 33,000 dalton polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase inhibitor and a 4,000 dalton cathepsin G inhibitor. Seeds of some members in the Cruciferae family, such as radish and broccoli, were found to contain one or more 2,500-4,000 dalton inhibitors which inhibited cathepsin G, trypsin, Hageman factor fragments, and plasmin, but not plasma kallikrein. These seeds also contained a 1,000 dalton cathepsin B inhibitor. The above inhibitors were probably polypeptides which inhibited proteinases by making an enzyme-inhibitor complex, with the exception of the cathepsin B inhibitor. These newly found inhibitors with their characteristic profiles of inhibition should be useful in biochemical and pathophysiological studies on granulocyte proteinases and enzymes of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways."
2001,11453713,"Power Shortage: clinical trials testing the ""homocysteine hypothesis"" against a background of folic acid-fortified cereal grain flour.","Large randomized, controlled trials of total homocysteine-lowering therapy for the potential reduction of cardiovascular disease outcomes are ongoing in the United States and Canada. These trials are the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Disease Study (WACS), and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE-2). However, the dramatic effect of policies mandating fortification of cereal grain flour products with folic acid may reduce the statistical power of these trials. All three trials assume that the active treatment groups will achieve the same mean effects of total homocysteine-lowering therapy as those reported in the absence of folic acid-fortified cereal grain flour. This paper examines this assumption using data from studies of total homocysteine-lowering therapy in U.S. and Canadian patients with cardiovascular disease who were exposed to products made with folic acid-fortified cereal grain flour. These data showed that the VISP trial, HOPE-2, and WACS will probably achieve only approximately 20% to 25% of the projected treatment effects of mean total homocysteine-lowering therapy (1.0 to 1.5 micromol/L vs. 4.0 to 6.0 micromol/L). As a result, all three trials will be substantially underpowered to test the specific hypotheses of total homocysteine-lowering therapy identified a priori. In contrast, renal transplant recipients have a persistent excess prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the era of fortification but remain very responsive to supraphysiologic doses of folic acid-based supplementation (mean reduction in total homocysteine level, 5.0 to 6.0 micromol/L). Therefore, unlike other populations with normal renal function that are at high risk for cardiovascular disease but are profoundly affected by fortification efforts, renal transplant recipients continue to merit serious consideration for a controlled trial of the ""homocysteine hypothesis."""
2007,17978486,Berberine activates GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"It has recently been known that berberine, an alkaloid of medicinal plants, has anti-hyperglycemic effects. To explore the mechanism underlying this effect, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes for analyzing the signaling pathways that contribute to glucose transport. Treatment of berberine to 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 6 h enhanced basal glucose uptake both in normal and in insulin-resistant state, but the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not augmented significantly. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) by wortmannin did not affect the berberine effect on basal glucose uptake. Berberine did not augment tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Further, berberine had no effect on the activity of the insulin-sensitive downstream kinase, atypical protein kinase C (PKCzeta/lambda). However, interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which have been known to be responsible for the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)1, were significantly activated in berberine-treated 3T3-L1 cells. As expected, the level of GLUT1 protein was increased both in normal and insulin-resistant cells in response to berberine. But berberine affected the expression of GLUT4 neither in normal nor in insulin-resistant cells. In addition, berberine treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in 3T3-L1 cells, which has been reported to be associated with GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. Together, we concluded that berberine increases glucose transport activity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by enhancing GLUT1 expression and also stimulates the GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake by activating GLUT1, a result of AMPK stimulation."

Milk from each udder was collected and grouped by the California Mastitis Test. Then, a somatic cell count (SCC) was performed, and the groups were re-scored as control (5-87 × 103 cells), 1st group (154-381 × 103 cells), 2nd group (418-851 × 103 cells), 3rd group (914-1958 × 103 cells), and 4th group (2275-8528 × 103 cells). Milk cell TP, NADPH, tGSH levels, G6PD, and GPx activities were assessed. Microbiological diagnosis and aerobic mesophyle general organism (AMG, cfu/g) were also conducted. In mastitic milk, TP, NADPH, and tGSH levels, and G6PD and GPx activities were significantly reduced per cell (in samples of 106 cells). In addition, milk SCC was positively correlated with AMG (r=0.561, p⟨0.001), NADPH (r=0.380, p⟨0.01), TP (r=0.347, p⟨0.01) and G6PD (r=0.540, p⟨0.001). There was also positive correlation between NADPH (r=0.428, p⟨0.01), TP (r=0.638, p⟨0.001) and AMG. NADPH was positively correlated with TP (r=0.239, p⟨0.05), GPx (r=0.265, p⟨0.05) and G6PD (r=0.248, p=0.056). Total protein was positively correlated with tGSH (r=0.354, p⟨0.01) and G6PD (r=0.643, p⟨0.001). There was a negative correlation between tGSH and GPx activity (r=-0.306, p⟨0.05). The microbiological analysis showed the following ratio of pathogens: Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci 66.6%, Streptococcus spp 9.5%, Bacillus spp 9.5%, yeast 4.8%, and mixed infections 9.5%. As a conclusion, when evaluating the enzyme and oxidative stress parameters in milk, it is more suitable to assign values based on cell count rather than ml of milk. The linear correlation between the SCC and AMG, milk cell NADPH, TP and G6PD suggests that these parameters could be used as markers of mastitis."
2019,30902317,Identifying chemical parameters and discriminant phenolic compounds from metabolomics to gain insight into the oxidation status of bottled white wines.,"Oxidative spoilage is a phenomenon that can occur both in winemaking and during bottle storage. The complexity of oxidative spoilage makes it difficult to identify all the products from oxidation processes, especially in bottled wines with varying degrees of oxidative spoilage, i.e., ""random oxidation"". To this end, this study sought to obtain a deeper insight into the chemistry of white wine samples to identify compounds able to discriminate the different oxidative statuses. The results of metabolomics and VIP analysis outlined molecules such as 3-methylcatechol, cyanidin 3-O-6″-p-coumaroyl-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucosyl-xyloside, dihydroquercetin, and quercetin 3-O-glucuronide to be discriminant in the detection of the oxidative status of the white wines under study, which were preliminarily classified in low and high oxidation classes by means of sensory analysis. Parameters such as total and free sulfur dioxide content and browning and pinking measurements were confirmed to remain significantly correlated with oxidation-related issues."
2008,18545256,28 years of high-dose therapy and SCT for neuroblastoma in Europe: lessons from more than 4000 procedures.,"Between 1978 and 2006, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registered 4098 high-dose therapy (HDT) procedures followed by stem cell rescue (SCR) (3974 autologous/124 allogeneic) in patients with neuroblastoma. The 5-year rates for overall (OS) and event-free survival are 37 and 32%, respectively. The median age at diagnosis is 3.9 years (0.3-62 years) with 76 patients older than 18 years. Patients above 10 years carry a 2.5-fold higher risk. Younger patients cure significantly (<0.001) better with OS rates of 40 and 30% for age groups 2-4 years and 4-10 years, respectively. Their risks are about twofold higher than that of patients below 2 years with OS rates of 60%. The better the quality of remission status before HDT/SCT the better are the observed OS rates: 43% in CR1 (1199 patients) and 42% for CR2 (140 patients), and 36% for those in very good partial or partial remission (1413 patients) and 21% for those with sensitive relapse (134 patients). Patients reported with stable disease in first remission still had an OS rate of 30%. Multivariate analysis shows significantly better OS in the age group of less than 2 years (<0.0001), as well as a better quality of remission status before HDT/SCT (P<0.0001), with the use of peripheral stem cells (P=0.014), autologous SCT (P=0.031) and busulphan/melphalan HDT (P<0.001). Busulphan/melphalan HDT/SCT in first remission achieves an OS of 48%, while it is only 35% with other regimens (P<0.001), including melphalan alone, other melphalan-containing regimens, a variety of other drugs given as a single HDT as well as the addition of TBI or sequential HDT/SCT procedures. Further progress in the field may only be expected from large-scale international randomized trials."
2013,23584844,Effects of dietary factors on the pharmacokinetics of 58Fe-labeled hemin after oral administration in normal rats and the iron-deficient rats.,"Hemin, iron (III) protoporphyrin chloride (IX), as a stable form of heme iron, has been used in iron absorption studies. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the influences of body iron status and three dietary factors (green tea extract, ascorbic acid, and calcium) on the pharmacokinetics of hemin using stable isotope labeling methods followed by ICP-MS measurement. In this study, a rapid, sensitive, and specific ICP-MS method for the determination of (58)Fe originating from hemin in rat plasma was developed and a rat model of iron deficiency anemia was established. It was found that hemin iron absorption increased significantly under iron deficiency anemia status, with AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ showing significant increase in anemic rats compared to normal ones. Green tea extract strongly inhibited hemin iron absorption in both normal rats and iron-deficient rats. In normal rats administered with green tea extract, C max resulted significantly reduced, whereas in anemic rats administered with green tea extract both AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were reduced. On the other hand, ascorbic acid significantly affected hemin iron absorption only in iron-deficient rats, in which C max showed a significant increase. Interestingly, calcium slowed down the hemin iron absorption rate in normal rats, MRT0-t being significantly different in calcium-treated animals compared to untreated ones. This trend also appeared in the iron-deficient group but it did not reach statistical significance. Our data suggest that the mechanism of hemin iron absorption is regulated by body iron status and dietary factors can influence hemin iron absorption to varying degrees. Moreover, these results may also have general implication in the iron deficiency treatment with iron supplements and fortification of foods."
2013,23215631,Advances in the control of wine spoilage by Zygosaccharomyces and Dekkera/Brettanomyces.,"Understanding the characteristics of yeast spoilage, as well as the available control technologies, is vital to producing consistent, high-quality wine. Zygosaccharomyces bailii contamination may result in refermentation and CO2 production in sweet wines or grape juice concentrate, whereas Brettanomyces bruxellensis spoilage often contributes off-odors and flavors to red wines. Early detection of these yeasts by selective/differential media or genetic methods is important to minimize potential spoilage. More established methods of microbial control include sulfur dioxide, dimethyl dicarbonate, and filtration. Current research is focused on the use of chitosan, pulsed electric fields, low electric current, and ultrasonics as means to protect wine quality."
2003,12875242,[Vasorelaxant activity of caffeic acid derivatives from Cichorium intybus and Equisetum arvense].,"The vasorelaxant activities of chicoric acid (Compound 1) from Cichorium intybus and dicaffeoyl-meso-tartaric acid (Compound 2) from Equisetum arvense L. in isolated rat aorta strips were studied. Compound 1 is a diester composed of (S,S)-tartaric acid and caffeic acid, and 2 is composed of its meso type. Both 1 and 2 showed slow relaxation activity against norepinephrine (NE)-induced contraction of rat aorta with/without endothelium. These compounds did not affect contraction induced by a high concentration of potassium (60 mM K+), while they inhibited NE-induced vasocontraction in the presence of nicardipine. These results show that the inhibition by 1 and 2 of NE-induced vasocontraction is due to a decrease in calcium influx from the extracellular space caused by NE. In addition, dicaffeoyl tartaric acids showed vasorelaxant activity, regardless of their stereochemistry."
1990,2355310,[Pharmacological study on Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng. II. Combined effects of arbutin and prednisolone or dexamethazone on immuno-inflammation].,"A study was carried out to examine the combined effect of arbutin isolated from the leaves of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng. (Bearberry leaf) and prednisolone or dexamethazone on Type IV allergic reaction-induced immuno-inflammation. Contact dermatitis caused by picryl chloride (PC-CD) and sheep red cell delayed type hypersensitivity (SRBC-DTH) in mice was not inhibited by the oral application of arbutin at 2 divided doses immediately before and 16 h after the application, but arbutin at doses of 10, 50 mg/kg 24 h after the application speedily decreased the swelling of PC-CD and SRBC-DTH. Arbutin plus prednisolone or dexamethazone showed the inhibitory effect on the swelling of PC-CD and SRBC-DTH stronger than that of prednisolone or dexamethazone alone. Prednisolone and dexamethazone decreased the weight of thymus and spleen in intact, PC-CD and SRBC-DTH mice, but arbutin did not show these effects. These results suggest that arbutin may increase the inhibitory action of prednisolone and dexamethazone on PC-CD and SRBC-DTH, but further investigations are required to understand the mechanism involved."
2016,26787146,Therapeutic Potential of Tea Tree Oil for Scabies.,"Globally, scabies affects more than 130 million people at any time. In the developed world, outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities result in a significant economic burden. A review of the literature demonstrates the emergence of resistance toward classical scabicidal treatments and the lack of effectiveness of currently available scabicides in reducing the inflammatory skin reactions and pyodermal progression that occurs in predisposed patient cohorts. Tea tree oil (TTO) has demonstrated promising acaricidal effects against scabies mites in vitro and has also been successfully used as an adjuvant topical medication for the treatment of crusted scabies, including cases that did not respond to standard treatments. Emerging acaricide resistance threatens the future usefulness of currently used gold standard treatments (oral ivermectin and topical permethrin) for scabies. The imminent development of new chemical entities is doubtful. The cumulative acaricidal, antibacterial, antipruritic, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing effects of TTO may have the potential to successfully reduce the burden of scabies infection and the associated bacterial complications. This review summarizes current knowledge on the use of TTO for the treatment of scabies. On the strength of existing data for TTO, larger scale, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted.

2013,23994817,Extract of Ginkgo biloba is equivalent to vitamin E in attenuating and preventing vacuous chewing movements in a rat model of tardive dyskinesia.,"Free radical-mediated abnormalities may contribute toward the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Many studies have reported the protective antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb761) against free radical-induced cell damage and dysfunction. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of EGb761 with that of vitamin E for the prevention and treatment of TD in a rat model. We carried out two studies. First, rats were injected with haloperidol (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 5 weeks. EGb761 (50 mg/kg/day) or vitamin E (20 mg/kg/day) were then administered for another 5 weeks, and their effects on vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) were compared. Second, we compared 10 weeks of haloperidol alone with 10 weeks of haloperidol plus EGb761 or vitamin E. The administration of haloperidol led to a progressive increase in VCMs, which peaked at week 5. In study one, EGb761 and vitamin E, administered by an oral gavage for 5 weeks during withdrawal from chronic haloperidol treatment, decreased VCMs significantly, showing 83.8 and 91.0% reduction, respectively, compared with the haloperidol-alone group. In study two, the concomitant administration of EGb761 and vitamin E led to significantly fewer VCMs, by 64.4 and 73.9%, respectively, compared with the haloperidol-alone group. There was no significant difference in either study between EGb761 and vitamin E treatment. EGb761 shows promise for the prevention and treatment of TD in a rat model with a magnitude that was similar to that of vitamin E."
2018,29145146,Evaluation of anti-urolithiatic and diuretic activities of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) using in vivo and in vitro experiments.,"Traditionally, Citrullus lanatus is known to have protective properties in kidney diseases and for having the ability to clear urine. Current study aims to validate the traditional uses of C. lanatus by evaluation of anti-urolithiatic and diuretic activities using in vivo and in vitro experiments. Male Wistar rats were used for in vivo anti-urolithiatic and diuretic activities. Supersaturated solution of calcium and oxalate was used for in vitro crystallization study. Hematoxylin & eosin staining was used for histopathological evaluation of kidney. In the in vivo rat model of urolithiasis, the pulp extract reduced calcium oxalate (CaOX) crystal count in both kidney and urine. The pulp extract also increased the urinary pH and output, and prevented the weight loss. Serum analysis showed elevation in creatinine clearance and reduction in urea and creatinine levels. Urinary analysis demonstrated that pulp extract restored altered phosphate, calcium, oxalate, and citrate levels. In the in vivo rat model of diuresis; the pulp extract produced diuresis, reduced serum chloride levels, and elevated urinary sodium and chloride levels. In the in vitro crystallization experiment, pulp extract inhibited the aggregation phase. Seed extract failed to show any convincing results. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of steroids and alkanes as the major constituents of pulp extract, which might be responsible for anti-urolithiatic activity; however, further studies are required for isolation and identification of active constituents. Current study validated the traditional uses of watermelon and demonstrated that pulp extract possessed significant anti-urolithiatic and diuretic activities."
2010,21150114,Improvement of the transformation efficiency of Flammulina velutipes Fv-1 using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter.,"To improve the expression level of heterologous genes in Flammulina velutipes Fv-1, we constructed new vectors having glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene promoter to control the expression of target genes. When the hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene from Escherichia coli was controlled by the gpd promoter, transformation efficiency was 3-fold higher than the case of that controlled by the tryptophan synthetase gene (trp1) promoter."
2011,21420389,Plant lectins are novel Toll-like receptor agonists.,"The T cell mitogen and plant glycoprotein, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), is commonly used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations to produce IL-2, IL-5, GM-CSF and IFN-γ and so provide an assay to detect immunosuppressants like FK506 and anti-inflammatories such as PDE IV inhibitors. During the early discovery of novel TLR agonists for the treatment of asthma we initially showed that PHA-L is a specific human TLR4 agonist, devoid of effects on equivalent TLR4 null cells. This TLR4 agonism was not due to LPS contamination of PHA-L, as polymyxin B was ineffective and unlike PHA-L, LPS did not stimulate TLR5 or TLR2/6. Also this specific PHA-L agonism of TLR4 was shown for different PHA forms, for example, PHA-P. This TLR lectin pharmacology finding was further explored by testing a broader panel of plant lectin representatives for agonism against a suite of hrTLR cell reporter assays (2/6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9). Soybean agglutinin (SBA), concanavalin A (ConA) and PHA lectin family members only stimulated extracellular TLRs (2/6, 4 and 5) probably due to lack of intracellular access, whilst other lectins were either pan-active (WGA) or inactive (AIL). Interestingly SBA only stimulated TLR4, ConA, TLR2/6 and PHA-L, TLR2/6, 4 and 5. As each lectin family exhibits different sugar ligand specificity for interaction, these results suggest that the pharmacology of this TLR agonism is encoded by the lectin's carbohydrate recognition motifs and the appropriate surface presentation of these motifs on different TLRs."
2013,23588682,Oromucosal delivery of venlafaxine by linseed mucilage based gel: in vitro and in vivo evaluation in rabbits.,"Linseed is the crop that is used as a foodstuff in European and Asian countries. The objective of the present work was to extract mucilage from linseed, utilize it as mucoadhesive gelling agent along with synthetic polymers and administration of venlafaxine by buccal route in the gel form. Buccal administration of venlafaxine will avoid first pass metabolism, which will increase the bioavailability of the drug. Linseed mucilage based buccal mucoadhesive gel preparations in combination with chitosan, carbopol 934P, carboxy methylcellulose and polyvinyl pyrrolidone were formulated and the viscosity, gel strength, percentage mucoadhesion and in vitro diffusion of the formulation was evaluated. Formulation (F2) was subjected to in vivo analysis in rabbits. Formulation F2, which contained linseed mucilage (2 %) and chitosan (0.5 %), showed the highest percentage of mucoadhesion, gel strength and sustained drug diffusion. The bioavailability by the oral route and buccal route were compared with that of the intravenous route. The bioavailability of venlafaxine in the formulation F2 was 63.08 ± 1.28 % by buccal route, which was higher than by the oral route (39.21 ± 6.18 %). Based on these results, the combination of linseed mucilage and chitosan can be used to form a buccal mucoadhesive gel and increase the bioavailability of venlafaxine."
2014,25087745,Mitigating efficacy of piperine in the physiological derangements of high fat diet induced obesity in Sprague Dawley rats.,"An increased risk of obesity has become a common public health concern as it is associated with hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, heart diseases, liver steatosis etc. Pharmacological intervention with natural product-based drugs is considered a healthier alternative to treat obesity. This study was aimed to evaluate anti-obesity effects of piperine on high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in rats. Piperine was isolated from methanolic extract of Piper nigrum by using column chromatography and confirmed by LC-MS analysis. Male SD rats were fed HFD initially for 15weeks to induce obesity. After induction of obesity, piperine was supplemented in different doses (20, 30 and 40mg/kgb.wt) through HFD for 42days to experimental rats. HFD induced changes in body weight, body composition, fat percentage, adiposity index, blood pressure, plasma levels of glucose, insulin resistance, leptin, adiponectin, plasma and tissue lipid profiles, liver antioxidants were explained. The activities of lipase, amylase and lipid metabolic marker enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were assessed in experimental rats. Supplementation of piperine at a dose of 40mg/kgb.wt has significantly (p<0.05) reversed the HFD-induced alterations in experimental rats in a dose dependant manner, the maximum therapeutic effect being noted at a dose of 40mg/kgb.wt. Our study concludes that piperine can be well considered as an effective bioactive molecule to suppress of body weight, improve insulin and leptin sensitivity, ultimately leading to regulate obesity.

2014,24688374,"Comparison of solubilization capacity of resveratrol in sodium 3α, 12α -dihydroxy-7-oxo-5 β-cholanoate and sodium dodecyl sulfate.","In this study we investigated resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) solubilization with sodium 3α,12 α-dihydroxy-7-oxo-5 β-cholanoate (S7-OD) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The investigation was aimed at determining whether large spherical micelles (SDS) or small longitudinal micelles (S7-OD) are more convenient for incorporation of resveratrol. Also, we studied resveratrol behavior in mixed micelles with mentioned surfactants using spectroflourimetric method as well as the effects of sodium chloride and urea on resveratrol solubilization capacity in the applied surfactants. Resveratrol solubilization curve was different in the investigated surfactants. Resveratrol solubilization curve for sodium 3α,12 α-dihydroxy-7-oxo-5 β-cholanoate at concentration 0.9 CMC reached saturation level of 60% dissolved resveratrol. The curve for sodium dodecyl sulfate was linear within the whole range of the investigated concentration; resveratrol solubilization rate reached 13% at 2 CMC. In S7-OD, NaCl increased capacity of resveratrol solubilization up to 1.4 CMC surfactant concentration, whilst maximum level of dissolved resveratrol (90%) was observed at 0.9 CMC. In SDS, NaCl decreased resveratrol solubilization capacity. Urea reduced resveratrol solubilization rate in sodium 3α ,12 α-dihydroxy-7-oxo-5 β-cholanoate, whereas it had inverse effect in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The obtained results strongly suggest that structure, that is, shape, of the surfactant micelles significantly affects their capacity of resveratrol solubilization. Also, presence of NaCl and urea influences solubilization capacities of investigated surfactants."
2008,18367983,Herbal supplements and therapeutic drug monitoring: focus on digoxin immunoassays and interactions with St. John's wort.,"Herbal supplements can affect concentrations of therapeutic drugs measured in biological fluids by different mechanisms. Herbal products can either directly interfere with the methodology used in the measurement of drugs or indirectly interfere by altering the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs. The active components of Chan Su, Lu-Shen-Wan, Dan Shen, Asian and Siberian ginseng, oleander containing supplements, and Ashwagandha interfere with digoxin measurements by immunoassays, especially the polyclonal antibody-based immunoassays. Herbal supplements are sometimes contaminated with Western drugs causing drug toxicity. A therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service is very helpful for diagnosis of drug toxicity in such patients. Herbal products such as St. John's wort, a popular herbal antidepressant, increase the clearance of certain drugs either by increasing the activity of liver or intestinal cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase or through modulation of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. Significantly reduced concentrations of various therapeutic drugs such as digoxin, theophylline, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, tricyclic antidepressants, warfarin, and protease inhibitors can be observed due to interaction of these drugs with St. John's wort, causing treatment failure. On the other hand, a few drugs such as carbamazepine, mycophenolic acid, and procainamide do not show any interaction with St. John's wort. Understanding the effect of herbal products on TDM methodologies and identification of interactions between herbal products and drugs by TDM are very important clinically."
2016,26948638,"Oenological characteristics, amino acids and volatile profiles of Hongqu rice wines during pottery storage: Effects of high hydrostatic pressure processing.","Hongqu rice wines were subjected to high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatments of 200 MPa and 550 MPa at 25 °C for 30 min and effects on wine quality during pottery storage were examined. HHP treatment can significantly (p<0.05) decrease the content of fusel-like alcohols and maintain the concentration of lactones in these wines. After 18 months of storage, the HHP-treated wines exhibited a more rapid decrease in total sugars (9.3-15.3%), lower free amino acid content (e.g. lysine content decreased by 45.0-84.5%), and higher ketone content (e.g. 6- and 14-fold increase for 2-nonanone). These changes could be attributed to the occurrence of Maillard and oxidation reactions. The wines treated at 550 MPa for 30 min developed about twice as rapidly during pottery storage than untreated wines based on principal component analysis. After only 6 months, treated wines had a volatile composition and an organoleptic quality similar to that of untreated wines stored in pottery for 18 months."
2012,23442705,Rapid analysis of cyclamate in foods and beverages by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD).,"A rapid method for determination of sodium cyclamate in foods and beverages was developed. Sodium cyclamate was converted to N,N-dichloridecyclohexylamine by reaction with sodium hypochlorite under acid condition. N,N-dichloridecyclohexylamine was subsequently extracted by n-hexane and determined by gas chromatography. Conditions such as derivatization time, the concentration of sodium hypochlorite and sulphuric acid were optimised. Amino acids, aliphatic amines, and food additives such as preservatives, dyes and sweeteners showed no interference for quantification of cyclamate. The correlation coefficient of calibration curve was 0.9993 in the range of 5.0-250mg/L. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were calculated as three or ten times the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), respectively. The LOD and LOQ for yellow wine and fruit juice were 0.05 and 0.2mg/L, respectively. The LOD and LOQ for cake and preserved fruit were 0.25 and 0.8mg/kg, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day RSD were 0.28% and 1.1% (n=5), respectively. The method was successfully applied for determination of cyclamate in yellow wine, cake, fruit juice and preserved fruit. This method was simple, fast, and sensitive. It was suitable for the determination of cyclamate in foods and beverages for safety and quality control inspections."
2014,24688396,Fabrication of ZnS-Bi-TiO2 composites and investigation of their sunlight photocatalytic performance.,"The ZnS-Bi-TiO2 composites were prepared by the sol-gel method and were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS). It is found that the doped Bi as Bi(4+)/Bi(3+) species existed in composites, and the introducing of ZnS enhanced further the light absorption ability of TiO2 in visible region and reduced the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. As compared to pure TiO2, the ZnS-Bi-TiO2 exhibited enhanced photodegradation efficiency under xenon lamp irradiation, and the kinetic constant of methyl orange removal with ZnS-Bi-Ti-0.005 (0.0141 min(-1)) was 3.9 times greater than that of pure TiO2 (0.0029 min(-1)), which could be attributed to the existence of Bi(4+)/Bi(3+) species, the ZnS/TiO2 heterostructure."
2011,21190139,Dietary supplementation of boron differentially alters expression of borate transporter (NaBCl) mRNA by jejunum and kidney of growing pigs.,"Inorganic boron (B), in the form of various borates, is readily absorbed across gastrointestinal epithelia. Although there is no stated B requirement, dietary B supplementation is thought to positively affect animal growth and metabolism, including promotion of bone strength and cell proliferation. Because of effective homeostatic control of plasma B levels, primarly by renal excretion, B toxicity in animals and humans is rare. The mechanisms responsible for improved animal performance and borate homeostasis are incompletely understood. Although a Na+-coupled borate transporter (NaBC1) has been identified, the effect of dietary B supplementation on expression of NaBCl has not been evaluated. An experiment was conducted with growing pigs to determine if NaBC1 mRNA was expressed by small intestinal epithelia and kidney of growing barrows and whether dietary B (as borate) supplementation would affect expression of NaBC1 mRNA. A concomitant objective was to test the hypothesis that B supplementation of a phosphorus (P)-deficient diet would improve calcium, phosphorus, or nitrogen retention. Twenty-four crossbred growing barrows (body weight=74.0±9.8 kg) were selected and used in a randomized complete block design experiment with a total of eight blocks and three B supplementation treatments (n=8/treatment). A typical corn-soybean meal basal diet (calculated to contain 41 mg intrinsic B/kg) was formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements, except for P, and fed to all pigs for 12 days. The basal diet plus 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg of B (prilled sodium borate pentahydrate, Na₂B₄O₇·5H₂O) was then fed for 18 more days. Feces and urine were collected during days 6 to 16 of the B supplementation, and pigs were killed for collection of jejunal and ileal epithelia and kidney tissue. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that NaBC1 mRNA was expressed by these tissues, a novel finding for jejunal and ileal epithelia. Boron supplementation increased jejunal, but decreased, renal NaBC1 mRNA expression, relative to the 0 mg/kg treatment. The finding that NaBC1 mRNA is regulatable by dietary B is novel. That B supplementation evoked opposite effects on jejunal and kidney NaBC1 mRNA expression indicates that transcriptional regulation of NaBC1 expression may constitute a part of the homeostatic control of B metabolism. In contrast to its effect on NaBC1 mRNA expression, B supplementation did not affect total tract digestibility or retention of phosphorus, calcium, or nitrogen."
2014,24617993,Muscadine grape skin extract reverts snail-mediated epithelial mesenchymal transition via superoxide species in human prostate cancer cells.,"Snail transcription factor can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), associated with decreased cell adhesion-associated molecules like E-cadherin, increased mesenchymal markers like vimentin, leading to increased motility, invasion and metastasis. Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. We investigated novel molecular mechanisms by which Snail promotes EMT in prostate cancer cells via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and whether it can be antagonized by MSKE.ARCaP and LNCaP cells overexpressing Snail were utilized to examine levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically, superoxide, in vitro using Dihydroethidium (DHE) or HydroCy3 dyes. Mitosox staining was performed to determine whether the source of ROS was mitochondrial in origin. We also investigated the effect of Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) on EMT marker expression by western blot analysis. Migration and cell viability using MTS proliferation assay was performed following MSKE treatments.Snail overexpression in ARCaP and LNCaP cells was associated with increased concentration of mitochondrial superoxide, in vitro. Interestingly, MSKE decreased superoxide levels in ARCaP and LNCaP cells. Additionally, MSKE and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) reverted EMT as evidenced by decreased vimentin levels and re-induction of E-cadherin expression in ARCaP-Snail cells after 3 days, concomitant with reduced cell migration. MSKE also decreased Stat-3 activity in ARCaP-Snail cells.This study shows that superoxide species may play a role in Snail transcription factor-mediated EMT. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Snail with various antioxidants such as MSKE may prove beneficial in abrogating EMT and ROS-mediated tumor progression in human prostate cancer."

2004,15577230,Studies on interactions between functional foods or dietary supplements and medicines. III. Effects of ginkgo biloba leaf extract on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in rats.,"The effects of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE), one of the most widely used herbal dietary supplements in Japan and the United States, on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine (NFP), a typical probe of P450 (CYP) 3A, but not a substrate of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), were studied using rats. Simultaneous oral treatment with GBE (20 mg/kg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration of NFP (2.5 mg/kg). However, the maximal plasma NFP concentration, the area under the concentration-time curve and absolute bioavailability after oral administration of NFP (5 mg/kg) were significantly increased by simultaneous oral treatment with GBE, approximately 1.6-fold, 1.6-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. These results suggest that the concomitant oral use of GBE appeared to reduce the first-pass metabolism of orally administered NFP, by inhibiting CYP3A, possibly but not P-gp, in rats."
2016,26593542,Chemical and sensory profiles of rosé wines from Australia.,"The appeal of rosé wine is attributable to its sensory profiles and underlying chemical composition, which are determined by viticultural and oenological inputs. This study provided the first insight into the sensory attributes and volatile profiles of Australian rosé wines. An HS-SPME-GC-MS method and a recently developed HPLC-MS/MS method were used to quantify 51 volatile compounds, including 4 potent sulfur compounds, in 26 commercial rosé wines. Descriptive analysis on all wines was undertaken and the sensory results were correlated with quantitative chemical data to explore relationships between wine composition and sensory profiles. Based on odour activity values, esters were prominent aroma volatiles, and β-damascenone, 3-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and 3-MHA were deemed to be important, in accord with other studies. Wines were described with terms ranging from developed, spicy and savoury to fresh green, citrus, tropical fruit, floral and confectionery. "
2008,18670086,Dexamethasone inhibits leukocyte accumulation and vascular permeability in retina of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats via reducing vascular endothelial growth factor and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression.,"Intravitreal injection of corticosteroid has been used to treat diabetic macular edema, however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. In the present experiment, four weeks after streptozotocin administration, intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (50 microg/10 microl) was performed. After 2 d injection, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on leukocyte accumulation, vascular permeability and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Accumulated leukocytes were counted in vivo by acridine orange leukocyte fluorography, the retinal vascular permeability was measured by the Evans blue assay. The mRNA and protein level of VEGF and ICAM-1 were analyzed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Dexamethasone downregulated VEGF and ICAM-1 expression in diabetic rats which correlated with its effect on leukocytes accumulation and retinal vascular permeability. The present data revealed that dexamethasone may inhibit retinal accumulation and leukostasis accumulation and vascular permeability through its blockage on VEGF and ICAM-1 expression."
1994,8133455,[Molecular genetics and biotechnology in medicinal plants: studies by transgenic plants].,"The advances in molecular genetics and biotechnology in the field of medicinal plant research are discussed with focusing on the works using transgenic plants. Differentiated organ cultures and transgenic teratomas, incited by the infection with mutants of Agrobacterium Ti and Ri plasmids, were established in quinolizidine-alkaloid producing plants and Solanaceae plants. These cultured cells were used for the production and bioconversion of specific alkaloids produced in these plants. The methods of integration of foreign genes into medicinal plants were developed using an Ri binary vector. The mode of gene expression driven by TR1'-2' promoters was elucidated in transgenic medicinal plants, e.g., Nicotiana tabacum, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Digitalis purpurea and Atropa belladonna. The genes for herbicide resistance, mammalian cytochrome P450 and bacterial beta-hydroxydecanoylthioester dehydrase were transferred and expressed in plants either to confer herbicide-resistant trait or to change the pattern of metabolites. The cDNA clones encoding cysteine synthase responsible for sulfur assimilation and biosynthesis of non-protein amino acids were isolated and characterized from Spinacea oleracea and Citrullus vulgaris. The functional lysine residue was identified by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. An over-expression system in Escherichia coli was constructed for the bacterial production of the plant specific non-protein amino acids. We made transgenic N. tabacum integrated with sense- and antisense-constructs of cysteine synthase cDNA driven by cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter for the purpose of genetic manipulation of biosynthetic flow of cysteine in plants. The future prospects of medicinal plant research are also discussed in the context of modern plant molecular biology."
2009,19627285,Niacin: a re-emerging pharmaceutical for the treatment of dyslipidaemia.,"Dyslipidaemias, particularly those characterized by the 'atherogenic profile' of high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, are the major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerosis. The search for drugs to favourably alter such lipid profiles, reducing the associated morbidity and mortality, remains a major research focus. Niacin (nicotinic acid) is the most effective agent available for increasing high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, but its use is associated with side effects that negatively affect patient compliance: these appear to arise largely as a result of production of prostaglandin D(2) and its subsequent activation of the DP(1) receptor. Desire to reduce the side effects (and improve pharmacokinetic parameters) has led to the development of a number of agonists that have differing effects, both in terms of clinical potency and the severity of adverse effects. The recent discovery of the niacin G-protein-coupled receptor HM74A (GPR109A) has clarified the distinction between the mechanism whereby niacin exerts its therapeutic effects and the mechanisms responsible for the generation of side effects. This has allowed the development of new drugs that show great potential for the treatment of dyslipidaemia. However, recent advances in understanding of the contribution of prostaglandin metabolism to vascular wall health suggest that some of the beneficial effects of niacin may well result from activation of the same pathways responsible for the adverse reactions. The purpose of this review is to emphasize that the search for agonists that show higher tolerability must take into account all aspects of signalling through this receptor."
2017,28511341,In vivo and molecular docking studies using whole extract and phytocompounds of Aegle marmelos fruit protective effects against Isoproterenol-induced Myocardial infarction in rats.,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading major health problem with increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present study investigates isoproterenol (ISO) induced MI and the beneficial role of Aegle marmelos fruit extract (AMFE) in rats. Our results indicated the significant augmentation of plasma nitric oxide (NOx) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, apolipoprotein B (apo-B), cardiac tissue lipid peroxidation and liver 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in ISO treated rats (85mg/kg b.wt) with a concomitant decrease in plasma apolipoprotein A1 (apo-A), lipase activity, paraoxonase-1 activity and cardiac tissue taurine levels when compared with controls. However, pretreatment of ISO administered rats with AMFE (150mg/kg b.wt/day for 45 days) markedly brought the observed alterations toward near normal level indicating its protective role against MI. Further, we have extended our studies to study the interaction of important phytocompounds, marmesin, marmin, umbelliferone and impertonin, present in AMFE with key enzymes, HMG-CoA reductase, iNOS, lipoprotein lipase and paraoxonase using AutoDock4. Molecular docking analysis indicated that HMG-CoA reductase, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and lipoprotein lipase formed a strong enzyme ligand complex with impertonin. While the marmesin showed strong interaction with paraoxonase enzyme. In conclusion, our results suggest that AMFE acts as a strong protective agent against ISO-induced MI, and the bioactive compounds are responsible for this protective action which is confirmed by molecular docking studies."
2018,30170097,Methylglyoxal at metronomic doses sensitizes breast cancer cells to doxorubicin and cisplatin causing synergistic induction of programmed cell death and inhibition of stemness.,"Potent anticancer activity coupled with absence of toxicity at therapeutic dose established the glycolytic metabolite, methylglyoxal, as a promising candidate against malignant neoplasia. In this preclinical study we illustrate the applicability of methylglyoxal in formulating an optimally designed combination regimen with chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer. Results demonstrated a synergistic augmentation in doxorubicin and cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 & MCF 7 with methylglyoxal co-treatment at metronomic concentrations. The cell death due to combination treatment was significantly prevented by N-Acetylcysteine and the synergistic effects were attenuated in presence of inhibitors for apoptosis and necroptosis, in MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 cells, respectively. Additionally, acridine orange staining and immunoblotting with LC3B antibody indicated the suppression of doxorubicin induced autophagy flux with methylglyoxal co-treatment. This report documents for the first time the preferential targeting of breast cancer stem cells by methylglyoxal. Combination treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin hindered mammosphere forming efficiency and inclusively eliminated both cancer stem as well as non-stem cancer cells. The synergistic effect was validated in Ehrlich mammary carcinoma cell induced murine ascites model and the combination advantage in vivo was achieved without any additional deleterious effect to liver and kidney. Our present study evidences the implications of methylglyoxal inclusion in adjuvant multimodal chemotherapeutics against breast cancer and offers noteworthy insights into the possible outcome."
2019,31358540,"Safety, Clinical Activity, and Biological Correlates of Response in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma: Results from a Phase I Trial of Atezolizumab.","Atezolizumab [anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)] selectively targets PD-L1 to block its interaction with receptors programmed death 1 and B7.1, thereby reinvigorating antitumor T-cell activity. We evaluated the long-term safety and activity of atezolizumab, along with biological correlates of clinical activity endpoints, in a cohort of patients with melanoma in an ongoing phase Ia study (NCT01375842).Patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma were enrolled to receive atezolizumab 0.1 to 20 mg/kg or ≥10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Primary study objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives included investigator-assessed efficacy measures; pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers of antitumor activity were explored.Forty-five patients were enrolled and were evaluable for safety. Most treatment-related adverse events (AE) were grade 1/2 (60%). Fatigue (44%), pruritus (20%), pyrexia (18%), and rash (18%) were the most common treatment-related AEs of any grade. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Overall response rate was 30% among 43 efficacy- evaluable patients, with a median duration of response of 62 months [95% CI, 35-not estimable (NE)]. Clinically meaningful long-term survival was observed, with a median overall survival of 23 months (95% CI, 9-66). Baseline biomarkers of tumor immunity [PD-L1 expression on immune cells, T effector (Teff), and antigen presentation gene signatures) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were associated with improved response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with durable responses and survival in patients with melanoma. PD-L1 expression, TMB, and Teff signatures may indicate improved benefit with atezolizumab in these patients."
2018,29765275,Tristemma hirtum and Five Other Cameroonian Edible Plants with Weak or No Antibacterial Effects Modulate the Activities of Antibiotics against Gram-Negative Multidrug-Resistant Phenotypes.,"In order to contribute to the fight against infectious diseases, the in vitro antibacterial activity and the antibiotic-potentiating effects of Tristemma hirtum and five other Cameroonian edible plants have been evaluated against Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. The microdilution method was used to evaluate the bacterial susceptibility of the extracts and their combination to common antibiotics. The phytochemical screening of the extracts was carried out according to standard methods. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenes, steroids, and polyphenols, including flavonoids in most of the tested extracts. The entire tested extracts showed moderate (512 μg/mL ≤ MIC ≤ 2048 μg/mL) to weak (MIC > 2048 μg/mL) antibacterial activities against the tested bacteria. Furthermore, extracts of leaf of Tristemma hirtum and pericarps of Raphia hookeri (at their MIC/2 and MIC/4) strongly potentiated the activities of all antibiotics used in the study, especially those of chloramphenicol (CHL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), kanamycin (KAN), and tetracycline (TET) against 70% (7/10) to 100% (10/10) of the tested MDR bacteria, with the modulating factors ranging from 2 to 128. The results of this study suggest that extracts from leaves of Tristemma hirtum and pericarps of Raphia hookeri can be sources of plant-derived products with antibiotic modifying activity."
2009,19601744,Estrone sulfatase and its inhibitors.,"A high proportion (approximately 40%) of breast cancers are hormone-dependent and it is the female hormone estradiol (E2) that is believed to play a key role in the initiation, promotion and progression of this disease. In the fight against this disease, compounds which are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme aromatase (AR) (which catalyses the conversion of the C19 androgens to the C18 estrogens) have been the major target. However, the administration of AR inhibitors alone does not prevent the localised biosynthesis of estrone (E1) (and therefore the subsequent synthesis of E2) within breast tumour cells via alternative non-AR routes. This has therefore been the major impetus for the development of steroid sulfatase (E1STS) inhibitors. The E1STS enzyme regulates the formation of E1 from estrone sulfate (E1S), a steroid conjugate present in high concentrations in tissue and blood in women with breast cancer. The STS enzyme has also been shown to catalyse the formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) from DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS). This is important since DHEA can be converted to 5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol, which has been shown to possess weak estrogenic properties, however, due to the high concentration of this steroid, it is able to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the development of a number of potent E1STS inhibitors, as such both steroidal and non-steroidal compounds have been considered and a number of highly potent inhibitors have been produced and evaluated against what is now considered a crucial enzyme in the fight against hormone-dependent breast cancer. The review therefore summarises the work that has been undertaken todate."
2015,26077375,Non-soya legume-based therapeutic lifestyle change diet reduces inflammatory status in diabetic patients: a randomised cross-over clinical trial.,"The present randomised cross-over clinical trial investigated the effects of two intervention diets (non-soya legume-based therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) diet v. isoenergetic legume-free TLC diet) on inflammatory biomarkers among type 2 diabetic patients. A group of thirty-one participants (twenty-four women and seven men; weight 74.5 (SD 7.0) kg; age 58.1 (SD 6.0) years) were randomly assigned to one of the two following intervention diets for 8 weeks: legume-free TLC diet or non-soya legume-based TLC diet. The latter diet was the same as the legume-free TLC diet, except that two servings of red meat were replaced with different types of cooked non-soya legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, peas and beans over a period of 3 d per week. The intervention period was followed by a washout period of 4 weeks, after which the groups followed the alternate treatment for 8 weeks. Concentrations of inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and after the intervention periods. Compared with the legume-free TLC diet, the non-soya legume-based TLC diet significantly decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6 and TNF-α in overweight diabetic patients. The replacement of two servings of red meat by non-soya legumes in the isoenergetic TLC diet for a period of 3 d per week reduced the plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers among overweight diabetic patients, independent of weight change."
2014,24989011,Effects of Salidroside on cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia damage and mTOR signaling repression in PC12 cells.,"Salidroside (SA), a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., has been documented to exert a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, including protective effects against neuronal death induced by various stresses. To provide further insights into the neuroprotective functions of SA, this study examined whether SA can attenuate cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-induced hypoxia damage and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling repression in PC12 differentiated cells. Differentiated PC12 cells were exposed to CoCl2 for 12 h to mimic hypoxic/ischemic conditions and treated with SA at the same time, followed by electron microscopy and analysis of cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) level, and the regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD1)/mTOR/ p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway. Our data indicated that SA can dramatically attenuate the ultrastructural damage of mitochondria induced by CoCl2 and significantly decrease CoCl2-induced ROS production. Moreover, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) was significantly reduced by CoCl2, and this inhibition was relieved by the treatment of SA in PC12 cells, as evidenced by immunoblot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses. The SA effects were blocked by pretreatment of RAD001. The results indicate that SA can rescue CoCl2-induced repression of REDD1/mTOR/ p70S6K signal transduction in PC12 cells. Our data demonstrate that SA is able to attenuate CoCl2-induced hypoxia damage and mTOR signaling repression, suggesting that SA may protect brain neurons from ischemic injury through mTOR signaling, and provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic."
2018,29382236,"Enhancement of solubility and bioavailability of ambrisentan by solid dispersion using Daucus carota as a drug carrier: formulation, characterization, in vitro, and in vivo study.","Ambrisentan is an US FDA approved drug, it is the second oral endothelin A receptor antagonist known for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, but its oral administration is limited due to its poor water solubility. Hence, the objective of the investigation was focused on enhancement of solubility and bioavailability of ambrisentan by solid dispersion technique using natural Daucus carota extract as drug carrier. Drug carrier was evaluated for solubility, swelling index, viscosity, angle of repose, hydration capacity, and acute toxicity test (LD50). Ambrisentan was studied for the saturation solubility, phase solubility, and Gibbs free energy change. Compatibility of drug and the natural carrier was confirmed by DSC, FTIR, and XRD. Solid dispersions were evaluated for drug content, solubility, morphology, in vitro, and in vivo study. Screening of the natural carrier showed the desirable properties like water solubility, less swelling index, less viscosity, and acute toxicity study revealed no any clinical symptoms of toxicity. Drug and carrier interaction study confirmed the compatibility to consider its use in the formulation. Formed particles were found to be spherical with smooth surface. In vitro studies revealed higher drug release from the solid dispersion than that of the physical mixture. Bioavailability study confirms the increased absorption and bioavailability by oral administration of solid dispersion. Hence, it can be concluded that the natural Daucus carota extract can be the better alternative source for the preparation of solid dispersion and/or other dosage forms for improving solubility and bioavailability."
2000,11200372,Impact on human intestinal microflora of an Enterococcus faecium probiotic and vancomycin.,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of a fermented milk product containing viable Enterococcus faecium on human intestinal microflora and to evaluate any risk of development of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Twenty Danish and 20 Swedish healthy volunteers were given 150 ml of the fermented milk product once daily, equivalent to a daily dose of 4.5 x 10(9) to 7.5 x 10(9) CFU E. faecium, for 10 d. Half of the volunteers also received 125 mg vancomycin orally q.i.d. for 10 d. Faecal samples were collected on day 0 before intake, on day 10 directly after end of intake and on day 31, 3 weeks after the end of the experiment. There was a significant increase in the total number of enterococci on day 10 (p < 0.01) in the group receiving only the E. faecium supplement, but 3 weeks later the level was as before intake. In the vancomycin group, the total number of enterococci was reduced on day 10 (p < 0.01) but had increased on day 31 (p < 0.01) in relation to day 0. In none of the Swedish and 4 of the Danish volunteers, VRE were sporadically detected, but without relation to intake of the probiotic or vancomycin. In healthy young Danish individuals the VRE carrier rate tended to be higher than previously found."
2016,26201681,Increasing Selenium and Yellow Pigment Concentrations in Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica L.) Grain with Foliar Application of Selenite.,"Although addition of selenium (Se) is known to increase Se in crops, it is unclear whether exogenous Se is linked to nutritional and functional components in foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.). In this study, we examined the potential of increasing Se and yellow pigment (YP) in foxtail millet grain by foliar application of Se. Field experiments were conducted during the growing season of foxtail millet in 2013 and 2014 to assess the effects of foliar spray of sodium selenite (10-210 g Se ha(-1)) on the yield, Se uptake and accumulation, total YP, and microminerals in the grain. Average grain yields with Se application were 5.60 and 4.53 t ha(-1) in the 2 years, showing no significant differences from the unfertilized control. However, grain Se concentration increased linearly with Se application rate, by 8.92 and 6.09 μg kg(-1) in the 2 years with application of 1 g Se ha(-1) (maximum grain recovery rates of Se fertilizer, 52 and 28 %). Likewise, total grain YP concentration markedly increased by 0.038 and 0.031 mg kg(-1) in the 2 years with application of 1 g Se ha(-1). Grain Mn, Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations were not significantly affected by Se application. This study indicated that foliar application of Se effectively and reliably increased the concentrations of Se and YP in foxtail millet grain without affecting the yield or mineral micronutrient concentrations. Thus, foliar-applied selenite has a significant potential to increase the concentrations of selenium and YP (putative lutein (Shen, J Cereal Sci 61:86-93, 2015; Abdel-Aal, Cereal Chem 79:455-457, 2002; Abdel-Aal, J Agric Food Chem 55:787-794, 2007)) of foxtail millet and, thus, the health benefits of this crop.

2015,25841876,"Dissociation between the panicolytic effect of cannabidiol microinjected into the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, and fear-induced antinociception elicited by bicuculline administration in deep layers of the superior colliculus: The role of CB1-cannabinoid receptor in the ventral mesencephalon.","Many studies suggest that the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), a tegmental mesencephalic structure rich in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons, is involved in the complex control of defensive responses through the neostriatum-nigral disinhibitory and nigro-tectal inhibitory GABAergic pathways during imminently dangerous situations. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role played by CB1-cannabinoid receptor of GABAergic pathways terminal boutons in the SNpr or of SNpr-endocannabinoid receptor-containing interneurons on the effect of intra-nigral microinjections of cannabidiol in the activity of nigro-tectal inhibitory pathways. GABAA receptor blockade in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (dlSC) elicited vigorous defensive behaviour. This explosive escape behaviour was followed by significant antinociception. Cannabidiol microinjection into the SNpr had a clear anti-aversive effect, decreasing the duration of defensive alertness, the frequency and duration of defensive immobility, and the frequency and duration of explosive escape behaviour, expressed by running and jumps, elicited by transitory GABAergic dysfunction in dlSC. However, the innate fear induced-antinociception was not significantly changed. The blockade of CB1 endocannabinoid receptor in the SNpr decreased the anti-aversive effect of canabidiol based on the frequency and duration of defensive immobility, the frequency of escape expressed by running, and both the frequency and duration of escape expressed by jumps. These findings suggest a CB1 mediated endocannabinoid signalling in cannabidiol modulation of panic-like defensive behaviour, but not of innate fear-induced antinociception evoked by GABAA receptor blockade with bicuculline microinjection into the superior colliculus, with a putative activity in nigro-collicular GABAergic pathways.

2013,23957955,Moringa Oleifera aqueous leaf extract down-regulates nuclear factor-kappaB and increases cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer cells.,"Fewer than 6% patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas live up to five years after diagnosis. Chemotherapy is currently the standard treatment, however, these tumors often develop drug resistance over time. Agents for increasing the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy or reducing the cancer cells' chemo-resistance to the drugs are required to improve treatment outcome. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, reportedly plays a significant role in the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis-based chemotherapy. This study investigated the effect of aqueous Moringa Oleifera leaf extract on cultured human pancreatic cancer cells - Panc-1, p34, and COLO 357, and whether it can potentiates the effect of cisplatin chemotherapy on these cells.The effect of Moringa Oleifera leaf extract alone and in combination with cisplatin on the survival of cultured human pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated by XTT-based colorimetric assay. The distribution of Panc-1 cells in the cell cycle following treatment with Moringa leaf extract was evaluated by flow cytometry, and evaluations of protein levels were via immunoblotting. Data of cell survival following combined treatments were analyzed with Calcusyn software.Moringa Oleifera leaf extract inhibited the growth of all pancreatic cell lines tested. This effect was significant in all cells following exposure to ≥0.75 mg/ml of the extract. Exposure of Panc-1 cells to Moringa leaf extract induced an elevation in the sub-G1 cell population of the cell-cycle, and reduced the expression of p65, p-IkBα and IkBα proteins in crude cell extracts. Lastly, Moringa Oleifera leaf extract synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on Panc-1 cells.Moringa Oleifera leaf extract inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, the cells NF-κB signaling pathway, and increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in human pancreatic cancer cells."
2016,27294945,Effects of Cerium and Titanium Oxide Nanoparticles in Soil on the Nutrient Composition of Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Kernels.,"The implications of metal nanoparticles (MeNPs) are still unknown for many food crops. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of cerium oxide (nCeO₂) and titanium oxide (nTiO₂) nanoparticles in soil at 0, 500 and 1000 mg·kg(-1) on the nutritional parameters of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) kernels. Mineral nutrients, amylose, β-glucans, amino acid and crude protein (CP) concentrations were measured in kernels. Whole flour samples were analyzed by ICP-AES/MS, HPLC and Elemental CHNS Analyzer. Results showed that Ce and Ti accumulation under MeNPs treatments did not differ from the control treatment. However, nCeO₂ and nTiO₂ had an impact on composition and nutritional quality of barley kernels in contrasting ways. Both MeNPs left β-glucans unaffected but reduced amylose content by approximately 21%. Most amino acids and CP increased. Among amino acids, lysine followed by proline saw the largest increase (51% and 37%, respectively). Potassium and S were both negatively impacted by MeNPs, while B was only affected by 500 mg nCeO₂·kg(-1). On the contrary Zn and Mn concentrations were improved by 500 mg nTiO₂·kg(-1), and Ca by both nTiO₂ treatments. Generally, our findings demonstrated that kernels are negatively affected by nCeO₂ while nTiO₂ can potentially have beneficial effects. However, both MeNPs have the potential to negatively impact malt and feed production."
2015,25442533,"Unique variability of tocopherol composition in various seed oils recovered from by-products of apple industry: rapid and simple determination of all four homologues (α, β, γ and δ) by RP-HPLC/FLD.","The tocochromanol profile was studied in seed oils recovered from by-products of fruit industry, five dessert and seven crab apple varieties grown in Eastern Europe (Latvia). The seed oils obtained from dessert apples were characterized by higher contents of tocopherols (191.05-379.08 mg/100g oil) when compared to seed oils recovered from crab apples (130.55-202.54 mg/100g oil). The predominant homologues of tocopherol in all the studied samples were α and β over γ and δ. However, seed oils recovered from the apple cultivars 'Antej' and 'Beforest' had a unique profile of four tocopherol homologues (α:β:γ:δ) 91.41:80.55:72.46:79.03 and 114.55:112.84:78.69:73.00 mg/100g oil, respectively. A single dilution of seed oils in 2-propanol facilitated the direct use samples in the DPPH assay as well as injection into the RP-HPLC system containing a PFP (pentafluorophenyl) column, which resulted in a rapid separation of all four tocopherol homologues with excellent repeatability and reproducibility."
2019,30694594,MIDD0301 - A first-in-class anti-inflammatory asthma drug targets GABAA receptors without causing systemic immune suppression.,"We report a 28-day repeat dose immunotoxicity evaluation of investigational drug MIDD0301, a novel oral asthma drug candidate that targets gamma amino butyric acid type A receptors (GABAA R) in the lung. The study design employed oral administration of mice twice daily throughout the study period with 100 mg/kg MIDD0301 mixed in peanut butter. Compound dosing did not reveal signs of general toxicity as determined by animal weight, organ weight or haematology. Peanut butter plus test drug (in addition to ad libitum standard rodent chow) did not affect weight gain in the adult mice, in contrast to weight loss in 5 mg/kg prednisone-treated mice. Spleen and thymus weights were unchanged in MIDD0301-treated mice, but prednisone significantly reduced the weight of those organs over the 28-day dosing. Similarly, no differences in spleen or thymus histology were observed following MIDD0301 treatment, but prednisone treatment induced morphological changes in the spleen. The number of small intestine Peyer's patches was not affected by MIDD0301 treatment, an important factor for orally administered drugs. Circulating lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte numbers were unchanged in the MIDD0301-treated animals, whereas differential lymphocyte numbers were reduced in prednisone-treated animals. MIDD0301 treatment did not alter IgG antibody responses to dinitrophenyl following dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet haemocyanin immunization, indicating that systemic humoral immune function was not affected. Taken together, these studies show that repeated daily administration of MIDD0301 is safe and not associated with adverse immunotoxicological effects in mice."
1992,1530281,Bioavailability of iron from a traditional Tunisian meal with chickpeas fed to healthy rats.,"The influence of a diet of couscous with chickpeas, a traditional Tunisian meal, or one providing iron as ferrous sulfate, on the utilization of 59Fe was evaluated in studies with rats. The iron content of the couscous and chickpea preparation was 30 mg/kg dry weight. There was no difference in the relative absorption of iron from ferrous sulfate or couscous with chickpeas, suggesting that iron from this preparation may be a good dietary source of nonheme iron for rats. Couscous and chickpeas consumption in Tunisia are estimated at 13.3 and 3.2 kg per capita/year, respectively. Our results in rats indicate that these foods could contribute a large proportion of an individual's iron requirement. We conclude that the plant foods, especially the chickpeas, can be excellent sources of dietary-available iron."
2016,26907305,Protective Effect of Onion Extract on Bleomycin-Induced Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity in Human Lymphocytes.,"Following one of the world's largest nuclear accidents, occured at Fukushima, Japan in 2011, a significant scientific effort has focused on minimizing the potential adverse health effects due to radiation exposure. The use of natural dietary antioxidants to reduce the risk of radiation-induced oxidative DNA damage is a simple strategy for minimizing radiation-related cancer rates and improving overall health. The onion is among the richest sources of dietary flavonoids and is an important food for increasing their overall intake. Therefore, we examined the effect of an onion extract on cyto- and geno-toxicity in human lymphocytes treated with bleomycin (BLM), a radiomimetic agent. In addition, we measured the frequency of micronuclei (MN) and DNA damage following treatment with BLM using a cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay and a single cell gel electrophoresis assay. We observed a significant increase in cell viability in lymphocytes treated with onion extract then exposed to BLM compared to cells treated with BLM alone. The frequency of BLM induced MN and DNA damage increased in a dose-dependent manner; however, when lymphocytes were pretreated with onion extract (10 and 20 μL/mL), the frequency of BLM-induced MN was decreased at all doses of BLM and DNA damage was decreased at 3 μg/mL of BLM. These results suggest that onion extract may have protective effects against BLM-induced cyto- and genotoxicity in human lymphocytes. "
2012,22018075,A large-scale intervention to introduce orange sweet potato in rural Mozambique increases vitamin A intakes among children and women.,"β-Carotene-rich orange sweet potato (OSP) has been shown to improve vitamin A status of infants and young children in controlled efficacy trials and in a small-scale effectiveness study with intensive exposure to project inputs. However, the potential of this important food crop to reduce the risk of vitamin A deficiency in deficient populations will depend on the ability to distribute OSP vines and promote its household production and consumption on a large scale. In rural Mozambique, we conducted a randomised, controlled effectiveness study of a large-scale intervention to promote household-level OSP production and consumption using integrated agricultural, demand creation/behaviour change and marketing components. The following two intervention models were compared: a low-intensity (1 year) and a high-intensity (nearly 3 years) training model. The primary nutrition outcomes were OSP and vitamin A intakes by children 6-35 months and 3-5·5 years of age, and women. The intervention resulted in significant net increases in OSP intakes (model 1: 46, 48 and 97 g/d) and vitamin A intakes (model 1: 263, 254 and 492 μg retinol activity equivalents/d) among the younger children, older children and women, respectively. OSP accounted for 47-60 % of all sweet potato consumed and, among reference children, provided 80 % of total vitamin A intakes. A similar magnitude of impact was observed for both models, suggesting that group-level trainings in nutrition and agriculture could be limited to the first project year without compromising impact. Introduction of OSP to rural, sweet potato-producing communities in Mozambique is an effective way to improve vitamin A intakes."
2017,29217167,Potential protective effect of Pistacia lentiscus oil against chlorpyrifos-induced hormonal changes and oxidative damage in ovaries and thyroid of female rats.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Pistacia lentiscus oil (PLO), known for its antioxidant properties, on chlorpyrifos (CPF)-induced alterations in the thyroid, reproductive hormone levels, and oxidative damage in the ovaries and thyroid of adult Wistar rats. The animals were treated with orally administered PLO (2 mL/kg), CPF (6.75 mg/kg), and a combination of CPF and PLO for 30 days. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (Pg), estradiol (E2), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were assessed using chemiluminescence assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were examined in the ovaries and thyroid glands. The oil principal volatile compounds detected by gas chromatography analysis were: myrcene, α-pinene and limonene (26.21, 22.66 and 10.33%, respectively). No significant differences were observed between serum concentrations of TSH and FSH in the examined experimental groups. However, serum concentrations of LH, E2, Pg, T3, and T4 decreased significantly in CPF-treated rats in comparison with the controls. The body weight and relative weight of ovaries and thyroids in this group were also significantly reduced. The MDA and PC content increased significantly, while the GSH content was markedly depressed in the thyroid and ovaries of rats treated with CPF. Co-administration of PLO and CPF effectively ameliorated the adverse effects; the oxidative damage was reduced and the levels of thyroid and reproductive hormones restored to a normal range. In conclusion, it appears that PLO substantially alleviates the CPF-induced oxidative damage and hormonal alterations."
2003,14580784,Genotoxic effects of myosmine in human lymphocytes and upper aerodigestive tract epithelial cells.,"Myosmine, 3-(1-pyrroline-2-yl)pyridine, is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. Recently, it was also detected in various edibles and staple foods. Whereas other tobacco alkaloids such as nicotine and nornicotine and their nitrosation products, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), have been widely discussed, the mutagenic impact of myosmine has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, possible genotoxic effects of myosmine were studied in human lymphocytes and nasal mucosal cells using the alkaline single cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. DNA single strand breaks, alkali labile sites and incomplete excision repair sites were expressed using the Olive tail moment (OTM). One hour incubation with myosmine at 0, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mM induced a low but significantly dose-dependent increase of DNA migration from 1.29 +/- 0.13 to 18.25 +/- 1.59 (OTM, mean +/- S.E., N=11) in lymphocytes. In nasal mucosal cells a similar although somewhat less extensive DNA damage from 1.17 +/- 0.12 to 21.67 +/- 2.97 (OTM, mean +/- S.E., N=10-11) was obtained after 1 h incubation with myosmine at 0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mM. After prolonged incubation of human lymphocytes with 10mM myosmine for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h, a significant time-dependent increase of DNA migration from 3.45 +/- 0.43 to 57.77 +/- 8.24 (OTM, mean +/- S.E., N=4) was observed. Our data indicate that myosmine expresses significant genotoxic effects in human target cells of carcinogenesis. This result warrants further investigations on the impact of this dietary component on human health."
2012,23196970,Effect of zeolite nano-materials and artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) leaf extract on increase in urinary clearance of systematically absorbed nicotine.,"Nicotine, the main pharmacologically active component in tobacco and cigarette, has some toxic effects and also high potential for addiction. In this study, the effect of artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) and zeolite nano-materials on urinary excretion of nicotine and consequently elimination of systematically absorbed nicotine was investigated. A simple, valid and highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed for determination of nicotine in rat urine according to guidelines for bioanalysis.It was found that nano-zeolites can cause increase in urinary concentration of nicotine due to its high surface adsorption. Artichoke leaf extract can cause increase in urinary excretion of nicotine in longer post administration times. It was observed that co-administration of nanozeolites and the leaf extract has the synergetic effect on increasing the urinary excretion of nicotine."
2019,30654110,Pharmacokinetic interaction of calcitriol with 20(S)-protopanaxadiol in mice: Determined by LC/MS analysis.,"The physiological and anti-cancer functions of vitamin D3 are accomplished primarily via 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), whereas 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) is a ginsenoside, which is isolated from Panax ginseng, with potential anti-cancer benefits. In the present study, we report a pharmacokinetic (PK) herb-nutrient interaction between calcitriol and aPPD in mice. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed using 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione derivatizing agent and we subsequently used the method to quantitate calcitriol in mouse serum. The limit of quantitation was 0.01 ng/ml which is approximately 100 fold lower than the previously reported assay from our laboratory. Calcitriol PK parameters were determined in non-tumor-bearing or C4-2 human prostate tumor-bearing nude mice following oral co-administration of calcitriol either alone or in combination with aPPD. Mice were pretreated with oral aPPD (70 mg/kg) or vehicle control twice daily for seven consecutive days, followed by a single oral dose of 4 μg/kg calcitriol alone or in combination with aPPD. Our PK results demonstrated that co-administration of calcitriol with aPPD (following pre-treatment with vehicle for seven days) resulted in a 35% increase in the area under the curve (AUC0-24 h) and a 41% increase in the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) compared to the calcitriol only group. aPPD therefore significantly increased calcitriol serum exposure. We also saw a reduction in the time required to reach Cmax. In contrast, calcitriol PK in mice co-administered with calcitriol and aPPD as well as those pretreated seven consecutive days with aPPD was no different than that determined for the mice that received vehicle for seven days as pre-treatment. Co-administration of calcitriol with aPPD therefore could increase health benefits of vitamin D3, however any increased risk of hypercalcemia, resulting from this combination approach, requires further investigation. Lastly, we surmise that a cytochrome P450 inhibition-based mechanism may contribute to the observed PK interaction."
2013,23178381,"Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative, induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by modulating PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway.","Aspidin PB, a phloroglucinol derivative isolated from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, has been previously reported to exert high biological activities. In the present study, we analyzed the apoptotic mechanisms of aspidin PB on human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Initially, aspidin PB was shown to inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. After treatment with aspidin PB for 72 h, 48 h and 24 h using MTT assay, the IC(50) values were 10.59 μM, 20.86 μM and 46.59 μM, respectively. Aspidin PB was capable to induce apoptosis, as measured by mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), acridine orange (AO) staining and propidium iodide (PI)/annexin V-FITC double staining. To further explore the signaling pathway of aspidin PB-mediated apoptosis, we examined PI3K/Akt related proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that aspidin PB inhibited PI3K expression, phosphorylation of Ser473 Akt and Ser9 GSK3β followed by up-regulation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs activated gene-1 (NAG-1) expression. Similarly, the effects of aspidin PB on PI3K, Akt, GSK3β, NAG-1 expression were abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Taken together, our data suggested that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signal pathway may represent one of the major mechanisms of the effects of aspidin PB on human hepatocarcinoma cells."
,11876445,Comparative analysis of phenolic acids in mistletoe plants from various hosts.,"Phenolic acids present in mistletoe plants collected from various hosts were analysed with the use of HPLC. The following numbers of compounds were found in the mistletoe plant material gathered from respective hosts: Sorbus aucuparia- 12 compounds; Acer plantanoides--14 compounds: Malus domestica, Pyrus communis and Populus nigra--13 compounds each; Quercus robur--15 compounds. Altogether 21 phenolic acids were chromatographically identified in the tested material. The compounds were either free or combined as esters or glycosides. Comparative chromatography revealed qualitative differences in the investigated compounds between the various plant materials. For example o-coumaric acid was only found in mistletoe hosted by Quercus robur. Digallic acid was only found in the plant material hosted by Acer plantanoides. Qualitative and quantitative composition of mistletoes hosted by Malus domestica and Pyrus communis showed considerable similarities as far as phenolic acids were concerned. Moreover. vanillic acid. absent in all other batches of plant material, seemed to be characteristic of the above mistletoes. Quantitative HPLC analysis demonstrated a considerable content of salicylic acid (39.55 mg%) in mistletoe hosted by Sorbus aucuparia. Apart from the above material, this compound was only present in small quantities in plants hosted by Populus nigra (15.63 mg%) and Quercus robur (2.63 mg%)."
2001,11163336,"Tyrphostin [correction of Tryphostin] AG879, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor: prevention of transcriptional activation of the electrophile and the aromatic hydrocarbon response elements.","To investigate a possible role of phosphorylation in the signal transduction pathways responsible for transcriptional regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes, we tested seven specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins) for their effects on NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) mRNA levels in mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 (Hepa-1) cells and chose to study AG879 further. The potent electrophile tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is known to activate NQO1 gene transcription via the electrophile response element (EPRE). Among the tyrphostins tested, tyrphostin AG879 was unique in preventing the accumulation of tBHQ-induced NQO1 mRNA; this effect was dependent on the AG879 dose and was also sensitive to the time when AG879 was added relative to the beginning of tBHQ treatment. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin; TCDD) is known to activate Cyp1a1 gene transcription by way of aromatic hydrocarbon response elements (AHREs). We found that AG879 also prevents, to a lesser extent, the AHRE-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and NQO1 mRNA by dioxin. Zinc or cadmium is known to activate metallothionein (Mt1) gene transcription via the metal response element (MRE). AG879 induced MT1 mRNA, and AG879 did not block zinc- or cadmium-induced MT1 mRNA, indicating that the effects of AG879 on NQO1 or CYP1A1 mRNA levels cannot be generalized to all transcripts. Using transient transfection of EPRE-, AHRE-, or MRE-driven luciferase reporter gene constructs in Hepa-1 cells, we showed that the inhibitory effects of AG879 occurred at the level of EPRE- and AHRE-mediated transcription, but that AG879 did not affect the MRE-driven transcriptional response. These data suggest that AG879 might inhibit an unknown tyrosine kinase(s) whose activity is essential for EPRE- and AHRE-mediated trans-activation of certain mammalian genes. These results also indicate that some sharing of common signal transduction pathways might exist in the regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism that also respond to oxidative stress."
2015,25529706,Chemical properties in fruits of mulberry species from the Xinjiang province of China.,"Mulberries are a widely cultivated foodstuff both in China and worldwide. However, there are stark differences in the nutritional values of mulberry species. To better appreciate these differences, we here describe the chemical characteristics of white (Morus alba L.), Russian (M. alba var. tatarica L.), and black (Morus nigra L.) mulberry fruits cultivated in the Xinjiang province of China. The chemical composition analysis was performed by official methods procedures. The amino acids were analysed by the phenyl isothiocyanate method. The 2,6-dichloroindophenol titrimetric method, the aluminium chloride colorimetric method, and the pH differential method were also used in measuring the content of reduced ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, and total monomeric anthocyanins, respectively. The black mulberry fruits had the highest content of reduced ascorbic acid (48.4 mg/100 g fw), titratable acidity (47.1 mg/g fw), and Fe (11.9 mg/100 g fw) of these 3 species. The Russian mulberry fruits had the highest EAA/TAA (essential amino acid/total amino acid) ratio at 44% followed by the white mulberry (42%) and the black mulberry (29%). The black mulberry fruits had found to be richest in terms of total flavonoids and total monomeric anthocyanins. These results are helpful for selecting mulberry species with abundant nutrients and phytochemicals for commercial cultivation."
2014,24206703,On-line solid-phase extraction using a C₁₈ minicolumn coupled to a flow injection system for determination of caffeine in green and roasted coffee beans.,"A novel and fast method based on the solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to a flow injection system for the determination of caffeine in coffee beans was developed. The caffeine extraction of coffee beans was carried out with hot water. A C18 reverse-phase mini-column was coupled to a continuous flow manifold to carry out the on-line SPE and the quantification of caffeine from aqueous extracts. Column length, retention time, elution volume, extracting solution and injection volume were evaluated. The retention time was of 90s and the elution was carried out with 400 μL of a methanol:water mixture (25:75). The proposed on-line SPE was compared against a chloroform extraction from aqueous extracts. With the proposed method the sample preparation was minimised and the sample throughput was increased (10 determination/h) because no dilution was required. Green coffee beans and beans with different roasting degree were analyzed."
1997,9301115,Cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase activity and pyridoxal phosphate binding site of onion alliin lyase.,"Purification of onion alliin lyase gave two fractions by cation exchange chromatography. Both fractions showed the comparable high catalytic activity of cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase with that of alliin lyase using S-(2-chloro-6-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine and alliin, S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide as substrates. All the active substrates tested with onion alliin lyase were also active to the cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase of Mucor javanicus, but the catalytic activity of the Mucor enzyme was lower for all the substrates. The pyridoxal phosphate binding site of the onion alliin lyase was identified as Lys 285 in the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA which has been reported. This lysine was conserved in all the sequences from the alliin lyase cDNAs, while similarity was not found between the sequences around pyridoxal phosphate binding sites of both the onion alliin lyase and the Mucor cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase."
2015,25318392,Derivation of a water quality guideline for aluminium in marine waters.,"Metal risk assessment of industrialized harbors and coastal marine waters requires the application of robust water quality guidelines to determine the likelihood of biological impacts. Currently there is no such guideline available for aluminium in marine waters. A water quality guideline of 24 µg total Al/L has been developed for aluminium in marine waters based on chronic 10% inhibition or effect concentrations (IC10 or EC10) and no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) from 11 species (2 literature values and 9 species tested including temperate and tropical species) representing 6 taxonomic groups. The 3 most sensitive species tested were a diatom Ceratoneis closterium (formerly Nitzschia closterium; IC10 = 18 µg Al/L, 72-h growth rate inhibition) < mussel Mytilus edulis plannulatus (EC10 = 250 µg Al/L, 72-h embryo development) < oyster Saccostrea echinata (EC10 = 410 µg Al/L, 48-h embryo development). Toxicity to these species was the result of the dissolved aluminium forms of aluminate (Al(OH4 (-) ) and aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3 (0) ) although both dissolved, and particulate aluminium contributed to toxicity in the diatom Minutocellus polymorphus and green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta. In contrast, aluminium toxicity to the green flagellate alga Tetraselmis sp. was the result of particulate aluminium only. Four species, a brown macroalga (Hormosira banksii), sea urchin embryo (Heliocidaris tuberculata), and 2 juvenile fish species (Lates calcarifer and Acanthochromis polyacanthus), were not adversely affected at the highest test concentration used."
2018,29374471,"Subchronic toxicity, immunoregulation and anti-breast tumor effect of Nordamnacantal, an anthraquinone extracted from the stems of Morinda citrifolia L.","Morinda citrifolia L. that was reported with immunomodulating and cytotoxic effects has been traditionally used to treat multiple illnesses including cancer. An anthraquinone derived from fruits of Morinda citrifolia L., nordamnacanthal, is a promising agent possessing several in vitro biological activities. However, the in vivo anti-tumor effects and the safety profile of nordamnacanthal are yet to be evaluated.In vitro cytotoxicity of nordamnacanthal was tested using MTT, cell cycle and Annexin V/PI assays on human MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Mice were orally fed with nordamnacanthal daily for 28 days for oral subchronic toxicity study. Then, the in vivo anti-tumor effect was evaluated on 4T1 murine cancer cells-challenged mice. Changes of tumor size and immune parameters were evaluated on the untreated and nordamnacanthal treated mice.Nordamnacanthal was found to possess cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB231, MCF-7 and 4T1 cells in vitro. Moreover, based on the cell cycle and Annexin V results, nordamnacanthal managed to induce cell death in both MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells. Additionally, no mortality, signs of toxicity and changes of serum liver profile were observed in nordamnacanthal treated mice in the subchronic toxicity study. Furthermore, 50 mg/kg body weight of nordamncanthal successfully delayed the progression of 4T1 tumors in Balb/C mice after 28 days of treatment. Treatment with nordamnacanthal was also able to increase tumor immunity as evidenced by the immunophenotyping of the spleen and YAC-1 cytotoxicity assays.Nordamnacanthal managed to inhibit the growth and induce cell death in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro and cease the tumor progression of 4T1 cells in vivo. Overall, nordamnacanthal holds interesting anti-cancer properties that can be further explored."
2011,21791624,Resveratrol ameliorates metabolic disorders and muscle wasting in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by dysregulated energy metabolism. Resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic animals. However, its overall in vivo effects on energy metabolism and the underlying mechanism require further investigation. In the present study, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to characterize the urine and plasma metabolomes of control, streptozotocin-induced DM and RSV-treated DM rats. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and heat map analysis, we discovered significant differences among control and experimental groups. RSV treatment significantly reduced the metabolic abnormalities in DM rats. Compared with the age-matched control rats, the level of carnitine was lower, and the levels of acetylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine were higher in the urine and plasma of DM rats. RSV treatment ameliorated the deranged carnitine metabolism in DM rats. In addition, RSV treatment attenuated the diabetic ketoacidosis and muscle protein degradation, as evidenced from the attenuation of elevated urinary methyl-histidine and plasma branched-chain amino acids levels in DM rats. The beneficial effects of RSV in DM rats were correlated with activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase and SIRT1 expression, increase of hepatic and muscular mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibition of muscle NF-κB activities. We concluded that RSV possesses multiple beneficial metabolic effects in insulin-deficient DM rats, particularly in improving energy metabolism and reducing protein wasting."
2012,21781365,Iodine concentration of organic and conventional milk: implications for iodine intake.,"Iodine is required for adequate thyroid hormone production, which is essential for brain development, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy. Milk is the principal source of iodine in UK diets, and while small studies in Europe have shown organic milk to have a lower iodine concentration than conventional milk, no such study has been conducted in Britain. In view of the increasing popularity of organic milk in the UK, we aimed to compare the iodine concentration of retail organic and conventional milk and to evaluate regional influences in iodine levels. Samples of organic milk (n 92) and conventional milk (n 80), purchased from retail outlets in sixteen areas of the UK (southern England, Wales and Northern Ireland), were analysed for iodine using inductively coupled plasma MS. The region of origin of the milk was determined from information on the label. Organic milk was 42·1 % lower in iodine content than conventional milk (median iodine concentration 144·5 v. 249·5 ng/g; P < 0·001). There was no difference in the iodine concentration of either conventional or organic milk by area of purchase. However, a difference was seen in iodine concentration of organic milk by region of origin (P < 0·001). The lower iodine concentration of organic milk has public-health implications, particularly in view of emerging evidence of iodine deficiency in UK population sub-groups, including pregnant women. Individuals who choose organic milk should be aware that their iodine intake may be compromised and should ensure adequate iodine intake from alternative sources."
2003,12388155,Novel experimental protocol to increase specific plasma nonesterified fatty acids in humans.,"This study reports a novel protocol to increase plasma monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in eight healthy volunteers (age 29-54 yr, body mass index 23-26 kg/m(2)). This was achieved by feeding small boluses of fat at different time points (35 g at 0 min and 8 g at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 min) in combination with a continuous low-dose heparin infusion. Olive oil, safflower oil, or palm stearin were used to increase monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, or saturated NEFAs, respectively. Plasma NEFA concentrations were increased for 2 h, when fat and heparin were given (olive oil: 745 +/- 35 micromol/l; safflower oil: 609 +/- 37 micromol/l, and palm stearin: 773 +/- 38 micromol/l) compared with the control test (no fat and no heparin: 445 +/- 41 micromol/l). During the heparin infusion, 18:1 n-9 was the most abundant fatty acid for the olive oil test compared with 18:2 n-6 for the safflower oil test and 16:0 for the palm stearin test (P < 0.01). The method described here successfully increases several types of plasma NEFA concentrations and could be used to investigate differential effects of elevated individual NEFAs on metabolic processes."
2019,31084445,Design of selegiline-loaded bio-nanosuspension for the management of depression using novel bio-retardant from Manilkara zapota.,"Objective: Depression is one of the most frequent psychiatric and potentially life-threatening disorders. This research work can offer a potential for delivery of selegiline moiety via ocular route in bio-nanosuspension mode for the effective management of depression after preclinical performance screening. Methods: The selegiline-loaded bio-nanosuspension was prepared using novel bio-retardant isolated from fruit pulp of Manilkara zapota (Sapodilla) by sonication solvent evaporation method with different ratios (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 1%) and with standard polymer HPMC (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5%). The prepared formulations were evaluated for pH stability studies, %entrapment efficiency, in vitro drug release, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, and stability studies. Results: The prepared bio-nanosuspension was subjected to the best formulation based on comparison of above-mentioned evaluation parameters, so Fb2 (0.1%) formulation was found to be the best formulation showing an R2 value of 0.9814, T50% of 29.7 h, and T80% of 65.25 h. According to the release kinetics, the best fit model was found to be the Korsmeyer-Peppas with the Fickian diffusion (Higuchi matrix) as the mechanism of drug release. Manilkara zapota (Sapodilla) provided excellent stability for the formulation and resulting particle size for the best formulation was found to be 252 nm. The bio-nanosuspension had PDI of 0.35 with zeta potential of -8.91 mV. Conclusion: The prepared bio-nanosuspension was found to be safe and compatible with the ophthalmic delivery for treatment of depression."
2000,10673673,Human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV) contamination of peripheral blood and autograft products from multiple myeloma patients.,"Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), has recently been identified within the bone marrow dendritic cells of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. This virus contains homologues to human cytokines such as IL-6 that could potentially stimulate myeloma cell growth and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Since mobilization chemotherapy may increase circulating dendritic cell numbers, we searched for HHV-8 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and after mobilization chemotherapy given to MM patients. Furthermore, we determined if autograft purging using the CEPRATE SC device would reduce the percentage of HHV-8 infected stem cell products. Only two of the 39 PBMC samples collected prior to mobilization chemotherapy contained PCR detectable virus, yet nine of 37 PBMCs collected on the first day of leukapheresis had detectable HHV-8 (P = 0.016). HHV-8 was more frequently identified in autograft products before vs after Ceprate SC selection (40% vs 15%, P = 0.016). Although the role HHV-8 plays in myeloma pathogenesis remains unclear, these results imply that mobilization chemotherapy increases the numbers of circulating HHV-8-infected dendritic cells within the peripheral blood. In addition, CD34 selection of autograft products in MM patients may reduce the reintroduction of virally infected cells following high-dose chemotherapy.

2005,16297708,Soybean saponins suppress the release of proinflammatory mediators by LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages.,"Proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins (PGs), nitric oxide (NO), certain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a pivotal role in tumor development. The anti-inflammatory properties of naturally occurring phytochemicals are associated with significant reduction in the risk of certain cancers in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the effects of soybean saponins on the production of proinflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Soybean saponins significantly inhibited the release of PGE(2), NO, TNFalpha and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in a dose-dependent manner. Soybean saponins also down-regulated the expression of COX-2 and iNOS at mRNA/protein levels. Moreover, soybean saponins suppressed NF-kappaB activation by blocking IkappaB-alpha degradation. Our data indicate that soybean saponins exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Roselle, enriched with antioxidants, demonstrates high potential in alleviating hypertension. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of roselle supplementation of VED and remodelling in a rodent model with prolonged nicotine administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 per group) were administered with 0.6 mg/kg nicotine for 28 days to induce VED. The rats were given either aqueous roselle (100 mg/kg) or normal saline orally 30 min prior to nicotine injection daily. One additional group of rats served as control. Thoracic aorta was isolated from rats to measure vascular reactivity, vascular remodelling and oxidative stress. Roselle significantly lowered aortic sensitivity to phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction (Endo-(+) Cmax = 234.5 ± 3.9%, Endo-(-) Cmax = 247.6 ± 5.2%) compared with untreated nicotine group (Endo-(+) Cmax = 264.5 ± 6.9%, Endo-(-) Cmax = 276.5 ± 6.8%). Roselle also improved aortic response to endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine (Endo-(+) Rmax = 73.2 ± 2.1%, Endo-(-) Rmax = 26.2 ± 0.8%) compared to nicotine group (Endo-(+) Rmax = 57.8 ± 1.7%, Endo-(-) Rmax = 20.9 ± 0.8%). In addition, roselle prevented an increase in intimal media thickness and elastic lamellae proliferation to preserve vascular architecture. Moreover, we also observed a significantly lowered degree of oxidative stress in parallel with increased antioxidant enzymes in aortic tissues of the roselle-treated group. This study demonstrated that roselle prevents VED and remodelling, and as such it has high nutraceutical value as supplement to prevent cardiovascular diseases."
2014,25446499,4'-Demethyl-deoxypodophyllotoxin glucoside isolated from Podophyllum hexandrum exhibits potential anticancer activities by altering Chk-2 signaling pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.,"We investigated the root of Podophyllum hexandrum as a potential source of lead bioactive metabolites with anticancer activity. The present study led to the isolation of six known aryltetralin-type lignans designated as 4'-demethyl-deoxypodophyllotoxin (1), podophyllotoxin (2), 4'-demethyl-podophyllotoxin (3), podophyllotoxin-4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (4), 4'-demethyl-deoxypodophyllotoxin-4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (5), 4'-demethyl-podophyllotoxin-4-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (6), along with three known flavones Kaempferol (7), Quercetin (8), Astragalin (9) from the root of P. hexandrum. Compounds (1-9) exhibited the remarkable cytotoxic potential in diverse cancer cell lines. 5 therapeutic potential was extensively studied first time which exhibiting antiproliferative and ROS generating activity than its non-glycoside analogue 1. Furthermore, 5 augmented the apoptotic cascades in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, viz. nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, probably by destabilizing the micro-tubular protein tubulin. Strikingly, our docking study and in vitro assays demonstrate that 5 binds to and modulate checkpoint kinase-2, a key cell cycle regulatory protein in normal and cancer cells. "
2012,22753154,Effect of piperine on antihyperglycemic activity and pharmacokinetic profile of nateglinide.,"Piperine (CAS no: 94-62-2), an alkaloid obtained from Piper nigrum and P. longum is a known inhibitor of various enzymes (CYP isozymes) responsible for biotransformation of drugs. By inhibiting the metabolism of drugs, piperine improves the bioavailability of drugs. In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent anti-hyperglycemic activity of nateglinide (CAS no: 105816-04-4) as evaluated by glucose challenged and alloxan-induced diabetic models, when it was administered with nateglinide. Nateglinide plasma concentrations were also increased, when administered with piperine. The synergistic anti-hyperglycemic activity of nateglinide when administered with piperine can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of nateglinide. The results of this study demonstrate that piperine could be used as a potential bioenhancer along with nateglinide."
2016,27793925,Cantharidin Impairs Cell Migration and Invasion of Human Lung Cancer NCI-H460 Cells via UPA and MAPK Signaling Pathways.,"Cantharidin (CTD), a component of natural mylabris (Mylabris phalerata Pallas), has been shown to have biological activities and induce cell death in many human cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CTD on cell migration and invasion of NCI-H460 human lung cancer cells. Cell viability was examined and results indicated that CTD decreased the percentage of viable cells in dose-dependent manners. CTD inhibited cell migration and invasion in dose-dependent manners. Gelatin zymography analysis was used to measure the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2/-9) and the results indicated that CTD inhibited the enzymatic activities of MMP-2/-9 of NCI-H460 cells. Western blotting was used to examine the protein expression of NCI-H460 cells after incubation with CTD and the results showed that CTD decreased the expression of MMP-2/-9, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Ras homolog gene family, member A (Rho A), phospho-protein kinase B (AKT) (Thr308)(p-AKT(308)), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (p-p38), phospho c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (p-JNK1/2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA). Furthermore, confocal laser microscopy was used to confirm that CTD suppressed the expression of NF-κB p65, but did not significantly affect protein kinase C (PKC) translocation in NCI-H460 cells. Based on those observations, we suggest that CTD may be used as a novel anticancer metastasis agent for lung cancer in the future."
2019,30902300,Nutritional quality of fresh and stored legumes sprouts - Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v enrichment.,"Nutrient content and digestibility as well as factors with a potentially negative effect on these parameters were studied in legume sprouts enriched with L. plantarum 299v. The nutrient digestibility and contents were not strongly affected by the co-culture of the probiotic and sprouts. The highest digestibility of starch was observed for adzuki bean preparations (from 91.6% to 95.5%), while the lowest value was noted for soybean preparations (from 49.6% to 60.8%). A slight decrease in starch digestibility was observed in adzuki and soybean sprouts enriched with the probiotic (by about 5% and 7% respectively). An increase in starch digestibility was noted in lentil and mung bean sprouts. A key influence on protein digestibility was exerted by the activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors. Generally, there was no negative effect of the studied factors on starch digestibility. Most importantly, the control and probiotic-rich sprouts retained high quality after cold storage."
2010,20858479,C-Phycocyanin inhibits MDR1 through reactive oxygen species and cyclooxygenase-2 mediated pathways in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.,"The effects of C-Phycocyanin (C-PC), a biliprotein from Spirulina platensis on the regulation of multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1), a poly glycoprotein in human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2 were reported. The results revealed that a significant down regulation of MDR1 expression in C-PC treated HepG2 cells was through reactive oxygen species and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mediated pathways. C-PC in a concentration dependent manner increased the accumulation of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells and enhanced sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin by 5 folds. The induction of MDR1 expression by PGE₂ and its down regulation by C-PC and DPI (Diphenylene iodonium, NADPH oxidase inhibitor) or by COX-2 knockdown suggest that the enhanced sensitivity of HepG2 cells to doxorubicin by C-PC is mediated by the down regulation of MDR1 expression. Further studies reveal the involvement of NF-κB and AP-1 in the C-PC induced down regulation of MDR1. Also the inactivation of the signal transduction pathways involving Akt, ERK, JNK and p38 by C-PC was observed. The present study thus demonstrates the efficacy of C-PC in overcoming the MDR1 mediated drug resistance in HepG2 cells by the down regulation of reactive oxygen species and COX-2 pathways via the involvement of NF-κB and AP-1."
2011,21821714,Adverse psychological outcomes in long-term survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation: a report from the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study (BMTSS).,"Little information exists regarding long-term psychological health of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors. Using resources offered by the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study (BMTSS), we evaluated adverse psychological outcomes in 1065 long-term HCT survivors and a healthy comparison group composed of siblings. Psychological health status was evaluated using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18. Twenty-two percent of the HCT survivors reported adverse psychological outcomes, compared with 8% of the siblings. Exposure to prednisone was associated with psychological distress across all domains (anxiety, depression, and somatic distress). Fifteen percent of the HCT survivors reported somatic distress, representing an almost 3-fold higher risk comparing to siblings. Among survivors, in addition to low annual household income and self-reported poor health, having severe/life-threatening conditions and presence of active chronic GVHD were associated with a 2-fold increased risk for somatic distress. Seven percent of the HCT survivors expressed suicidal ideation; patients with higher scores on depression subscale were most vulnerable. This study demonstrates that somatic distress is the biggest challenge faced by survivors long after HCT. These results identify vulnerable subpopulations and provide patients, families, and healthcare providers with necessary information to plan for post-HCT needs many years after HCT."
2003,14519995,Proteases of Maitake (Grifola frondosa) responsible for breakdown of wheat flour dough and their reaction with gluten proteins.,Two proteases capable of decreasing dough strength when added to wheat flour were purified from Maitake and these were both thought to be peptidyl-Lys metalloendopeptidase. The major purified protease SP-3-A hydrolyzed high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits preferably to the other glutenin subunits. SP-3-A cleaved peptide bonds adjacent to the N-terminal of lysine in the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit.
1985,2581640,Identification of human megakaryocyte coagulation factor V.,"Specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents and a double antigen indirect immunofluorescence microscopy technique were used to visualize coagulation factor V in human bone marrow. Marrow aspirates were smeared directly on glass slides, or washed and cytospun onto glass slides, or processed and plated into a plasma/methylcellulose cell culture system. Morphologically identifiable colonies of megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes, or monocytes/macrophages were removed from 14- to 18-day marrow culture dishes by micropipette and streaked onto glass slides. Smears of marrow cell preparations were air-dried, fixed, washed, and incubated sequentially with primary IgG antibody reagents and with secondary anti-IgG antibody reagents conjugated with either fluorescein or rhodamine. Preparations were examined and photographed through a microscope suitably equipped for two-color fluorescence and phase contrast analysis. Cells of megakaryocytic lineage were identified by their immunofluorescent reactivity with murine monoclonal antibody HP1-1D, specific for human platelet plasma membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa), or by their immunofluorescent reactivity with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for von Willebrand factor (vWF) or for platelet factor 4 (PF4). Coagulation factor V in bone marrow was detected by simultaneous immunofluorescent staining with polyclonal burro anti-human factor V antibody or with a panel of murine monoclonal anti-human factor V antibodies. The double antigen immunofluorescence staining technique, incorporating appropriate controls, revealed that coagulation factor V was principally located in marrow cells simultaneously identified as megakaryocytes by antibodies to GP IIb/IIIa, vWF, or PF4. The specific immunofluorescence of factor V in megakaryocytes and platelets was eliminated when excess purified factor V antigen was preincubated with anti-factor V antibody. Our observations establish the presence of human megakaryocyte coagulation factor V, confirm the presence of human platelet factor V, and indicate that human megakaryocyte/platelet coagulation factor V is a lineage-associated protein."
2005,16272810,[Effects of sweetie juice on nifedipine pharmacokinetics in rats].,"It has been reported that grapefruit juice (GJ) causes pharmacokinetic interactions with many drugs after co-ingestion, but the effects of the juice of sweetie fruit, a cross between a pomelo and a grapefruit, on the pharmacokinetics of medicines have not been clear. The present study investigated the drug interaction capability of sweetie juice (SJ). The effect of SJ on nifedipine (NFP) pharmacokinetics in rats was studied. Two milliliters of SJ, GJ, or saline was administered to the rat duodenum. After 30 min, NFP was administered intraduodenally at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight. The NFP concentrations in the plasma samples were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Although GJ increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of NFP (1.6-fold), SJ had no significant effect on the NFP pharmacokinetics in rats. Furthermore, concentrations of furanocoumarin derivatives in SJ were measured by HPLC equipped with a photodiode array detector, and compared with those in GJ. SJ contained lower concentrations of bergamottin (0.53 microg/ml), 6', 7'-dihydroxybergamottin (0.19 microg/ml), and bergaptol (0.2 microg/ml) than the GJ used in this study (6.3 microg/ml, 3.6 microg/ml, and 9.4 microg/ml, respectively). In conclusion, the results suggest that SJ had no effect on the NFP pharmacokinetics in rats due to low furanocoumarin concentrations in SJ."
2016,27581210,Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like inflammation of BALB/c mice.,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory immune disease with undefined pathogenesis. It is associated with T cells, and the IL-23/IL17 axis is believed to be crucial in the pathogenesis. The present treatments have side effects that influence the compliance of patients. Tea polyphenol is extracted from tea polyphenols, and its main active ingredient is Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-ultraviolet radiation effects. Here, we aim to report that EGCG can inhibit imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation.We used BALB/c mice, which were topically treated with IMQ for 6 consecutive days, as a psoriasis mouse model. Topical application of EGCG and treatment with EGCG were conducted in the experiments. Then observed the effects of the two methods on psoriasis-like mice dermatitis. Statistics are presented as the means ± standard error of mean (SEM) and compared using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or one-way ANOVA.Topical application of EGCG alleviated psoriasiform dermatitis, improved the skin pathological structure by reduce the expression of epidermal PCNA, promoted the expression of caspase-14. Treatment with EGCG attenuated skin inflammation, accompanied by reduced infiltrations of T cells; reduced percentages of CD11c(+) DC in the composition of immunocytes of spleens; reduced levels of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma; increased percentages of CD4(+) T cells in the composition of immunocytes of spleens; and increased bioactivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in plasma.All the results demonstrated that EGCG had anti-inflammatory, immune regulatory and antioxidant effects. It is a promising intervention in psoriasis in the future."
2004,15363547,Suppression of invasion in human U87 glioma cells by adenovirus-mediated co-transfer of TIMP-2 and PTEN gene.,"TIMPs and PTEN are known to be inhibitors of the invasive activities of malignant glioma. But there has been no literature reported concerning the effect of combined gene transfer of these two genes on invasiveness of glioma. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of adenovirus-mediated in vitro gene transfer of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) on invasion of human U87 glioma cells. The mRNA and protein expressions of TIMP-2 and PTEN in U87 cells infected with AdTIMP-2 and AdPTEN were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The relative activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by Gelatin zymogram and invasion of U87 in vitro were detected using Boyden chamber. The number of invasion cell of U87, U87 infected with Ad-gal, AdPTEN, AdTIMP-2 and AdPTEN/TIMP-2 was 55.63+/-13.27, 48.27+/-14.75, 35.27+/-10.94, 27.37+/-12.81, and 19.17+/-5.45, respectively. In vitro invasiveness of glioma cells was significantly inhibited by infection with AdTIMP-2 and/or AdPTEN, which was not consistent with the change of MMPs activity. And in the combinated group, the inhibition effect was more remarkable than in single group. Our studies suggest that adenovirus-mediated combined TIMP-2 and PTEN gene therapy is possibly useful for anti-invasion therapy of malignant glioma."
1992,1736909,Long-term local effects of intraosseous infusion on tibial bone marrow in the weanling pig model.,"The weanling pig model was used to determine the long-term local effects, if any, on tibial bone marrow after intraosseous (IO) infusion of resuscitation fluid and drugs at standard dosages. One of six IO treatments (two normal saline boluses [20 mL/kg]; bolus sodium bicarbonate [1 mEq/kg]; 10% sodium bicarbonate infusion at a maintenance rate for 1 hour; bolus 1:10,000 epinephrine [0.01 mg/kg]; 1:10,000 epinephrine solution infusion, 1 microgram/kg/min for 1 hour; or dopamine infusion, 10 micrograms/kg/min for 1 hour) was randomly administered via the left tibia to 18 pigs at 4 weeks of age. The animals were subsequently followed for 3 months, after which marrow from the same space and peripheral blood were examined. Marrow from the right tibia of each animal served as control; untreated historic controls were also used for comparison. Examination of the marrow revealed normal cell differentials in all limbs in all groups. Overall cellularity was somewhat decreased in the experimental limbs of the normal saline bolus group when compared with same-animal control limbs, perhaps due to the pressure effect from rapid injection. Peripheral blood counts and differentials in these and all other animals were normal. The authors conclude that IO administration of commonly used resuscitative medications does not result in significant adverse effects in the tibial bone marrow in this model."
2012,22584007,Black bear parathyroid hormone has greater anabolic effects on trabecular bone in dystrophin-deficient mice than in wild type mice.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease that has deleterious consequences in muscle and bone, leading to decreased mobility, progressive osteoporosis, and premature death. Patients with DMD experience a higher-than-average fracture rate, particularly in the proximal and distal femur and proximal tibia. The dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse is a model of DMD that demonstrates muscle degeneration and fibrosis and osteoporosis. Parathyroid hormone, an effective anabolic agent for post-menopausal and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, has not been explored for DMD. Black bear parathyroid hormone (bbPTH) has been implicated in the maintenance of bone properties during extended periods of disuse (hibernation). We cloned bbPTH and found 9 amino acid residue differences from human PTH. Apoptosis was mitigated and cAMP was activated by bbPTH in osteoblast cultures. We administered 28nmol/kg of bbPTH 1-84 to 4-week old male mdx and wild type mice via daily (5×/week) subcutaneous injection for 6 weeks. Vehicle-treated mdx mice had 44% lower trabecular bone volume fraction than wild type mice. No changes were found in femoral cortical bone geometry or mechanical properties with bbPTH treatment in wild type mice, and only medio-lateral moment of inertia changed with bbPTH treatment in mdx femurs. However, μCT analyses of the trabecular regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia showed marked increases in bone volume fraction with bbPTH treatment, with a greater anabolic response (7-fold increase) in mdx mice than wild type mice (2-fold increase). Trabecular number increased in mdx long bone, but not wild type bone. Additionally, greater osteoblast area and decreased osteoclast area were observed with bbPTH treatment in mdx mice. The heightened response to PTH in mdx bone compared to wild type suggests a link between dystrophin deficiency, altered calcium signaling, and bone. These findings support further investigation of PTH as an anabolic treatment for DMD-induced osteoporosis."
2018,29322301,Effects of short-term DHEA intake on hormonal responses in young recreationally trained athletes: modulation by gender.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) figures on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances in sport because it is assumed that athletes expect a significant increase in testosterone through DHEA administration. The literature on the hormonal effects of DHEA intake nevertheless appears to be very scant in healthy young subjects, especially women.We examined the effects of DHEA on adrenal and gonadal hormones, IGF1 and free T3 in healthy young male and female recreationally trained volunteers.The study followed a double-blind, randomized-order crossover design. Lean healthy young men (n = 10) and women (n = 11), with all women using oral contraceptives, were treated daily with 100 mg of DHEA and placebo for 4 weeks. DHEA, DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, total testosterone (Tes), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), SHBG, estrone, cortisol, IGF1, and free T3 were measured before, in the middle and at the end of each treatment, as were blood glucose, liver transaminases and lipid status.We observed a significant increase in DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione, Tes, DHT, and estrone in both men and women in the middle and at the end of DHEA treatment, but the increase in Tes was more marked in women (p < 0.001) than men (p < 0.05). No changes were found in the other parameters, irrespective of gender.In young athletes, DHEA administration induces significant blood hormonal changes, some modulated by gender, which can be used as biomarkers of doping."
1989,2475044,Immunodeficiency in young pigs.,"Immunodeficiency in neonatal and young pigs was studied in terms of T-cell function. Generalized T-cell deficiency did not exist in young pigs on the basis of the in vitro response of blood mononuclear cells to a polyclonal T-cell mitogen, phytohemagglutinin. However, immunodeficiency that extended from birth up to 4 weeks, was observed in serum antibody concentration and in vitro proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells from young pigs exposed to a low antigen dose of a T-cell dependent antigen, egg white lysozyme. The low in vitro proliferative response to lysozyme was not attributable simply to a lack of interleukin-2 production, because supplementation with human interleukin-2 did not enhance the in vitro cellular response. Also, pokeweed mitogen-stimulated B cells from young pigs up to the age of 5 to 6 weeks produced immunoglobulin concentration, which also was not affected by the addition of human interleukin-2 to the in vitro cultures. The blood mononuclear cells obtained from pigs within the first 5 to 6 weeks after birth and incubated with monoclonal antibodies reactive to all T cells (MSA4), helper T cells (74-12-4) or suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (76-2-11) did not yield consistent excess of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2019,31116583,Zinc deficiency promotes endothelin secretion and endothelial cell migration through nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1 translocation.,"Zinc is involved in the expression and function of various transcription factors, including the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 and its target gene endothelin-1 (ET-1) are activated by intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the main consequences of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and both play a key role in the cardiovascular consequences of IH. Because OSA and IH are associated with zinc deficiency, we investigated the effect of zinc deficiency caused by chelation on the HIF-1/ET-1 pathway and its functional consequences in endothelial cells. Primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were incubated with submicromolar doses of the zinc-specific membrane-permeable chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylene diamine (TPEN, 0.5 µM) or ET-1 (0.01 µM) with or without bosentan, a dual ET-1-receptor antagonist. HIF-1α expression was silenced by transfection with specific siRNA. Nuclear HIF-1 content was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Migratory capacity of HMVEC was evaluated with a wound-healing scratch assay. Zinc chelation by TPEN exposure induced the translocation of the cytosolic HIF-1α subunit of HIF-1 to the nucleus as well as an HIF-1-mediated ET-1 secretion by HMVEC. Incubation with either TPEN or ET-1 increased endothelial wound-healing capacity. Both HIF-1α silencing or bosentan abolished this effect. Altogether, these results suggest that zinc deficiency upregulates ET-1 signaling through HIF-1 activation and stimulates endothelial cell migration, suggesting an important role of zinc in the vascular consequences of IH and OSA mediated by HIF-1-ET- signaling."
2015,25481273,Neonatal oxytocin administration and supplemental milk ameliorate the weaning transition and alter hormonal expression in the gastrointestinal tract in pigs.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of milk supplementation during lactation, over 1 wk after weaning, and oxytocin administration for the first 14 d of life on the pigs' response to weaning. Pigs from 20 litters were allocated to each of these 3 treatments in a randomized factorial design. Oxytocin was administered subcutaneously daily from 0 to 14 d of age at a rate of 10 I.U. per kg. The milk supplement consisted of a mixture of 25% skim milk powder offered either during lactation between 10 and 20 d of age or for the first week after weaning as a transitional diet along with dry pellets. Pigs were weaned at 21 d of age. Growth rate was measured from birth to slaughter at 140 d of age and feed intake of supplemental milk or feed from 10 to 56 d of age. Organ weights (heart, liver, stomach, and kidneys) and the gene expression of ghrelin, leptin, and glucagon-like peptides (glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2) were measured in the stomach, ileum, and duodenum at 10, 21, and 28 d of age. Milk supplementation after weaning resulted in immediate feed intake and partially alleviated the depression in growth rate over the first 7 d postweaning (P < 0.001), but milk supplementation during lactation had no effects (P > 0.1). However, effects were only transient and disappeared once the milk liquid diet was removed. Neonatal oxytocin administration reduced weight loss over the first 2 d after weaning (P = 0.03), without affecting feed intake (P > 0.1), hence possibly reducing weaning stress. Seven days after weaning, oxytocin-treated pigs had greater stomach ghrelin and leptin expression (both P = 0.02), and pigs supplemented with milk after weaning had greater stomach leptin and glucagon-like peptide-2 expression (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). Hence, neonatal oxytocin administration or postweaning milk supplementation are both effective means of enhancing gastric leptin expression and reducing weight loss at weaning, likely improving gut health during this critical period."
2010,21191760,Spirafolide from bay leaf (Laurus nobilis) prevents dopamine-induced apoptosis by decreasing reactive oxygen species production in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important mediators in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This study tested the neuroprotective effects of spirafolide, a compound purified from the leaves of Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae), against dopamine (DA)-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Following a 24-h exposure of cells to DA (final conc., 0.6 mM), we observed a marked increase in apoptosis, increased generation of ROS and decreased cell viability. Pretreatment of the cells for 24 h with spirafolide (0.4, 2, and 10 μM) before exposure to DA notably increased cell survival (p < 0.01) and lowered intracellular ROS levels (p < 0.01). These results indicate that spirafolide has neuroprotective effects against DA toxicity. These effects may contribute to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
2018,29207919,Enhancement of natural killer activity and IFN-γ production in an IL-12-dependent manner by a Brassica rapa L.,"Certain food components possess immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the immunostimulatory activity of Brassica rapa L. We demonstrated an enhancement of natural killer (NK) activity and interferon (IFN)-γ production in mice that were orally administered an insoluble fraction of B. rapa L. The insoluble fraction of B. rapa L. significantly induced IFN-γ production in mouse spleen cells in an interleukin (IL)-12-dependent manner, and NK1.1+ cells were the main cells responsible for producing IFN-γ. Additionally, the results suggested that the active compounds in the insoluble fraction were recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, and C-type lectin receptors on dendritic cells, and they activated signaling cascades such as MAPK, NF-κB, and Syk. These findings suggest that B. rapa L. is a potentially promising immuno-improving material, and it might be useful for preventing immunological disorders such as infections and cancers by activating innate immunity."
2013,23891385,"The involvement of growth hormone in equine oocyte maturation, receptor localization and steroid production by cumulus-oocyte complexes in vitro.","The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of equine growth hormone (eGH) on nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of equine oocytes in vitro, steroid production by cumulus cells, and expression and subcellular localization of eGH-receptors (eGH-R) on equine ovarian follicles. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were recovered by aspirating follicles <30 mm in diameter from abattoir-derived ovaries. The COCs were morphologically evaluated and randomly allocated to be cultured in either a control maturation medium or supplemented with 400 ng/mL eGH, for 30 h at 38.5°C in air with 5% CO2. The COCs were stained with 10 μg/mL propidium iodide and 10 μg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Lens culinaris agglutinin. Chromatin configuration and distribution of cortical granules were assessed via confocal microscopy. Compared to control, COCs incubated with eGH had: more oocytes that reached metaphase II (35/72, 48.6% vs. 60/89, 67.4%, respectively; P=0.02); greater concentrations of testosterone (0.21 ± 0.04 vs. 0.06 ± 0.01 ng/mL; P=0.01), progesterone (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 0.02 ± 0.00 ng/mL; P=0.04), and oestradiol (76.80 ± 14.26 vs. 39.58 ± 8.87 pg/mL; P=0.05) in the culture medium, but no significant differences in concentration of androstenedione. Based on Real Time RT-PCR analyses, expression of the eGH-R gene was greater in cumulus cells and COCs at the start than at the end of in vitro maturation. Positive immunostaining for eGH-R was present in cumulus cells, the oocytes and granulosa cells. In conclusion, addition of eGH to maturation medium increased rates of cytoplasmic maturation and had an important role in equine oocyte maturation, perhaps mediated by the presence of eGH-R in ovarian follicles."
2010,21150096,Increased lysine content in rice grains by over-accumulation of BiP in the endosperm.,"Over-accumulation of lysine-rich binding protein (BiP) in the rice endosperm caused strong endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduced seed storage proteins, resulting in a relative increase in nutritionally balanced non-seed storage proteins. We show that transgenic rice with over-accumulated BiP was a high-lysine rice germplasm and that the over-accumulation of BiP in the endosperm offered a unique strategy to improve the lysine content of cereal grains."
2016,26988514,"Isolation, purification and characterization of antioxidative peptide of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) protein hydrolysate.","Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is a rich source of protein, used for present study to hydrolyze protein, peptide separation and its functional activity. Antioxidative bioactive peptide was successfully identified from pearl millet using trypsin enzyme. Different antioxidative potential of isolated peptide were assessed based on activity of DPPH radical, ABTS radical, hydroxyl radical, Fe(2+) chelating ability and reducing power. Bioactive peptide separated by gel-filtration chromatography, showed the higher antioxidant activity as tested by different free radicals. The activity of pearl millet protein hydrolysate fraction was found for DPPH assay (67.66%), ABTS assay (78.81%), Fe(2+) chelating ability (51.20%), hydroxyl assay (60.95%) and reducing power (0.375nm) was further purified using reversed-phase UFLC and subjected to matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) for sequential identification of the peptide. The sequence SDRDLLGPNNQYLPK was identified as antioxidant peptide."
2002,12139218,Effect of grapefruit juice or cimetidine coadministration on albendazole bioavailability.,"The assumed metabolic breakdown of albendazole by mucosal CYP3A4 enzymes was studied by coadministering albendazole (10 mg/kg) with grapefruit juice. Concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide (ABZSX), the active metabolite of albendazole, were compared with those after albendazole was administered with water, a fatty meal, or grapefruit juice plus cimetidine (10 mg/kg). In comparison to water, maximum ABZSX concentration (Cmax) was enhanced 6.5-fold by a fatty meal (from 0.24 +/- 0.09 mg/l to 1.55 +/- 0.30 mg/l; mean +/- SD; P < 0.001) and 3.2-fold by grapefruit juice (from 0.24 +/- 0.09 mg/l to 0.76 +/- 0.37 mg/L; P = 0.031). When grapefruit juice was combined with cimetidine, Cmax was significantly lower than with grapefruit juice alone (0.41 +/- 0.29 mg/l and 0.76 +/- 0.37 mg/l, respectively; P = 0.022). The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-omega)) followed a comparable pattern. Half-life (T(1/2)) was 8.8 +/- 4.2 hr and 8.2 +/- 4.3 hr after administration with water or a fatty meal (P = 1.000). Grapefruit juice shortened T(1/2) by 46% (P = 0.026). We hypothesize that albendazole is metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes in the intestinal mucosa. This process can be inhibited by grapefruit juice. Cimetidine decreased albendazole bioavailability."
1995,11850662,Bioavailability Study of Nizatidine When Administered in Food.,"A single-center, open-label, four-way crossover study was performed in 22 healthy adult subjects to determine the relative effect and significance of certain foods on the bioavailability of nizatidine. Results indicate that administration of nizatidine mixed with apple sauce, cranberry juice, or vegetable juice reduces the bioavailability approximately 30--40% relative to administration of a nizatidine capsule with water. The reduction of bioavailability appears to be primarily due to reduced extent of absorption. The mechanism of this effect was not investigated."
2018,29386488,"Effects of Red Wine Vinegar Beverage on the Colonic Tissue of Rodents: Biochemical, Functional and Pharmacological Analyses.","A beverage made of red wine vinegar and grape juice (Yamanashi-no-megumi™) was developed as a supplemental fluid containing polyphenols, which has been clinically shown to enhance the colonic transit. In this study, we assessed the mechanism of its prokinetic action by analyzing the effects on both the colonic phosphodiesterase activity of rats (n=4) and the isolated colonic strip preparation of guinea pigs (n=4). The 7% (v/v) solution of the beverage significantly decreased the phosphodiesterase activity by 9% (n=4). The beverage in concentrations of 0.7, 2.1 and 7% (v/v) relaxed the colonic strips pre-contracted by 1 µmol/L of carbachol in a concentration-related manner with 50, 58 and 79%, each response of which was diminished to 11, 19 and 46%, respectively in the presence of 100 µmol/L of L-nitro-arginine methyl ester. These results obtained by biochemical, functional and pharmacological analyses suggest that the beverage could relax the colon through both cAMP-associated and nitric oxide-dependent pathways, which may partly explain clinically observed prokinetic effect of the beverage."
2017,27744600,Resveratrol Attenuates Copper and Zinc Homeostasis and Ameliorates Oxidative Stress in Type 2 Diabetic Rats.,"Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose level. Trace element homeostasis causes disturbances in diabetes due to hyperglycemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme, contains zinc and copper ions as its cofactors. Defects in SOD level and activity have been observed in diabetes. Resveratrol (RSV) has displayed hypoglycemic effects and is proven to improve oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible effects of RSV on blood glucose level, serum copper and zinc levels, SOD, and a number of other oxidative markers in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats with administration of streptozotocin and nicotine amide. The studied groups containing six animals per group were as follows: group 1 normal control group; group 2 diabetic control group; groups 3, 4, and 5 diabetic rats that received 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight of RSV, respectively for 30 days. Serum glucose, copper, zinc, SOD activity, total oxidant status (TOS) as well as thiol groups were all measured. Blood glucose in RSV treated groups significantly decreased. Similarly, copper significantly decreased in diabetic groups treated with RSV. Treatment with 10 mg/kg RSV resulted in significantly increased serum zinc. Furthermore, Cu/Zn ratio was observed to decrease in treated groups compared with untreated diabetic control group. RSV treated groups revealed an increased level of SOD activity as well as improved oxidative status. In summary, the results showed that RSV has potential hypoglycemic effect, attenuates trace element homeostasis, and consequently increases SOD activity level."
1991,1647798,What is the role of the central nervous system in mineralocorticoid hypertension?,"The importance of the central nervous system (CNS) in the development of mineralocorticoid hypertension has been well documented. Type I receptors in adrenalectomized rats are concentrated in the hippocampus, amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus, particularly in the periventricular regions, areas known to be or suspected of being important in the regulation of ACTH release, arousal, fluid and fluid osmolality equilibrium, and the maintenance of normal blood pressure. In the rat, ablation of the AV3V area and central, but not peripheral, sympathectomy prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension. The continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of aldosterone in rats or dogs at doses which do not affect the blood pressure when administered subcutaneously (sc) produces significant increases in resting blood pressure. In rats this effect is dose dependent, blocked by the concomitant icv infusion of prorenone, an aldosterone antagonist, and enhanced, but not completely dependent upon renal mass reduction and excess salt consumption. The icv infusion of RU28318, a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist, at doses which are ineffective when administered sc, inhibits the development of hypertension produced by the sc infusion of aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone, as well as that produced by the oral administration of a licorice derivative and of a high salt diet in the Dahl S/JR rat. It is assumed that this effect is mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor because it is inhibited by mineralocorticoid antagonists and because the icv infusion of RU26988, a selective glucocorticoid agonist, has no effect. The concomitant icv infusion of corticosterone, which is thought to be the primary ligand of the brain mineralocorticoid receptor, antagonizes the effect of icv infusion of aldosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2019,30723881,Parenteral Zinc Supplementation Increases Pregnancy Rates in Beef Cows.,"Zinc (Zn) is required for normal reproductive performance in cattle. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous injection of 400 mg Zn at the beginning of fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) on preovulatory follicle and corpus luteum (CL) size, plasma estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) concentrations, and pregnancy rates in beef cows. Copper (Cu) concentration and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in plasma were also evaluated. Zinc supplementation at the beginning of the FTAI protocol (day 0) increased the area of preovulatory follicle (APF, day 9; P = 0.042) and plasma P4 concentration (day 16; P = 0.01), whereas plasma E2 concentration (day 9) and area of CL (ACL; day 16) were not modified by Zn supplementation in cows with adequate plasma Zn concentration. Zinc supplementation in Zn-deficient cows increased ACL with respect to controls (P = 0.048) but did not modify plasma E2 concentration. Pregnancy rate on day 41 after FTAI was higher in cows supplemented with Zn compared with controls (80.95% and 51.61%, respectively; P = 0.042). Plasma Zn and Cu concentrations on days 7, 9, and 16 were not affected by Zn supplementation. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study determined that parenteral Zn supplementation at the beginning of the FTAI protocol increased preovulatory follicle size, plasma P4 concentration, and pregnancy rates in beef cows."
,11363122,Saquinavir with grapefruit juice.,"Bioavailability of the protease inhibitor, saquinavir, increases with consumption of grapefruit juice, according to a study of 12 HIV-negative people. Grapefruit juice inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4, a liver enzyme, which breaks down saquinavir. The effect was more pronounced when less water was used with the frozen grapefruit juice concentrate. Since grapefruit juice may cause stomach irritation or increase the toxicity of other drugs, Hoffmann-La Roche is pursuing a new saquinavir formulation."
2013,23561093,"Influence of air-drying temperature on drying kinetics, colour, firmness and biochemical characteristics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fillets.","In this work the drying kinetics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fillets and the influence of air drying temperature on colour, firmness and biochemical characteristics were studied. Experiments were conducted at 40, 50 and 60°C. Effective moisture diffusivity increased with temperature from 1.08×10(-10) to 1.90×10(-10) m(2) s(-1). The colour difference, determined as ΔE values (from 9.3 to 19.3), as well as firmness (from 25 to 75 N mm(-1)) of dried samples increased with dehydration temperature. The lightness value L(∗) and yellowness value b(∗) indicated formation of browning products at higher drying temperatures, while redness value a(∗) showed dependence on astaxanthin value. Compared with fresh fish samples, palmitic acid and tocopherol content decreased in a 20% and 40%, respectively, with temperature. While eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content remained unchanged and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content changed slightly. Anisidine and thiobarbituric acid values indicated the formation of secondary lipid oxidation products, which is more relevant for longer drying time than for higher drying temperatures."

A randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.","The effect of the powdered rhizome of Zingiber officinale (ginger root) on the gastric emptying rate was investigated. In a double-blind crossover trial, 16 healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to receive either 1 g of ginger or placebo. Gastric emptying was measured using the oral paracetamol absorption model. Ingestion of ginger did not effect gastric emptying. The antiemetic effect of ginger is not associated with an effect on gastric emptying. No adverse effects were noted."

(bearberry leaf) and prednisolone on immuno-inflammation].,"The effect of 50% methanolic extract (U-ext) from Bearberry leaf on immuno-inflammation was studied by contact dermatitis caused by picryl chloride (PC-CD) in mice. The combined effect of U-ext and prednisolone was also investigated by using similar experimental model. When given orally twice immediately before and 16 h after the application of PC-CD, U-ext did not show an inhibitory effect on the swelling induced by PC-CD while it exhibited a significant therapeutic effect at a dose of 100 mg/kg or more once 24 h after the application. When U-ext (p.o.) and prednisolone (s.c.) in a given portion were simultaneously administered, the inhibitory effect was more potent than that of prednisolone alone in both administration immediately before and 16 h after or once 24 h after the application. Arbutin isolated from U-ext also increased the inhibitory effect of prednisolone similarly to that of U-ext. These results suggest that Bearberry leaf possesses a therapeutic effect against immuno-inflammation induced by PC-CD and also increases the inhibitory effect of prednisolone, and its active principle may be arbutin."
2013,24416925,Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.,"Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects."
2014,24360476,Effects of nano-scaled fish bone on the gelation properties of Alaska pollock surimi.,"Gelation properties of Alaska pollock surimi as affected by addition of nano-scaled fish bone (NFB) at different levels (0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%) were investigated. Breaking force and penetration distance of surimi gels after setting increased significantly as NFB concentration increased up to 1%. The first peak temperature and value of storage modulus (G'), which is known to relate to the unfolding and aggregation of light meromyosin, increased as NFB concentration increased. In addition, 1% NFB treatment demonstrated the highest G' after gelation was completed. The activity of endogenous transglutaminase (TGase) in Alaska pollock surimi increased as NFB calcium concentration increased. The intensity of myosin heavy chain cross-links also increased as NFB concentration increased indicating the formation of more ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine covalent bond by endogenous TGase and calcium ions from NFB.

2017,27719911,"iTRAQ analysis of low-phytate mung bean sprouts treated with sodium citrate, sodium acetate and sodium tartrate.","The effects of sodium citrate (SC), sodium acetate (SA) and sodium tartrate (ST) spraying on mung bean germination were investigated. Exogenous SC, ST and SA treatments significantly reduced the phytic acid content and increased the antioxidant enzyme activities. In this study, an iTRAQ-based proteomic approach was employed to explore the proteomes of mung bean sprouts, and 81, 101 and 90 differentially expressed proteins were identified in 4-day-old SC-, SA- and ST-treated mung bean sprouts, with 38 proteins present in all samples. Functional classification analysis showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins in mung bean sprouts subjected to the three treatments were involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. The inhibitory effect of the SA treatment was probably due to impairments in protein biosynthesis, whereas enhanced energy metabolism, accelerated reserve hydrolysis and protein processing were very important strategies for growth stimulation in response to ST and SC treatments."
2006,16441932,Folate absorption from folate-fortified and processed foods using a human ileostomy model.,"Data on folate absorption from food from validated human studies using physiological folate doses are still needed to estimate dietary requirements and to formulate recommendations. The aim of the present work was to study the effects from fortified and processed foods on folate absorption in ileostomy volunteers (n 9) using the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and kinetic modelling. Using a standardized single-dose protocol, dairy products fortified with a candidate fortificant (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ((6S)-5-CH3-H4folate), folic acid-fortified bread and a dessert crème containing natural yeast folate polyglutamates were compared with folate supplements. Absorbed folate was estimated by AUC and a kinetic model, and non-absorbed folate by ileostomal folate excretion. Median apparent absorption from test foods ranged from 55 to 86 %. Added folate-binding proteins (FBP) significantly reduced folate absorption from dairy products, as in the absence of FBP, AUC-dose-corrected ratios were increased and ileal folate excretion decreased. After in vivo gastrointestinal passage of dairy products containing FBP, up to 43 % of the ingested FBP was found in ileostomal effluent. Folate absorption was similar for (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate fortificant from fermented milk and for folic acid from fortified bread. Folic acid, ingested as food fortificant in bread, was significantly less absorbed compared with an isolated supplement. We conclude that all tested foods were suitable matrices for folate fortification. However, dairy products, fortified with the new candidate fortificant (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate, are suitable if no active FBP is present."
2016,27374288,Cinnamomum loureirii Extract Inhibits Acetylcholinesterase Activity and Ameliorates Trimethyltin-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to the deficiency of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain, and the main treatment strategy for improving AD symptoms is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. In the present study, we aimed to identify potent AChE inhibitors from Cinnamomum loureirii extract via bioassay-guided fractionation. We demonstrated that the most potent AChE inhibitor present in the C. loureirii extract was 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol. To confirm the antiamnesic effects of the ethanol extract of C. loureirii, mice were intraperitoneally injected with the neurotoxin trimethyltin (2.5 mg/kg) to induce cognitive dysfunction, and performance in the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests was assessed. Treatment with C. loureirii extract significantly improved performance in both behavioral tests, suggesting that this extract may be neuroprotective and therefore beneficial in preventing or ameliorating the degenerative processes of AD, potentially by restoring cholinergic function.

1997,9478104,Acute poisoning with clenbuterol--a case report.,"In the paper we have described a case of acute, unintentional intoxication with clenbuterol, a selective beta 2-agonist. A 21-year-old bodybuilder to improve his physical fitness and to increase his muscle bulk was using clenbuterol in a dose of two tablets (20 mg) daily for a week before poisoning. On a day of acute intoxication he drank orange juice containing 48 tablets (4.8 g) of clenbuterol, which had been placed there by his friends. The patient was admitted to our clinic with tachycardia at rate 160 bpm, headache, dizziness, tremor, sweats, muscle weakness, agitation. Serum potassium concentration was 2.6 mmol/L, blood glucose level 18.7 mmol/L. All the symptoms and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after intravenous treatment with propranolol (1.0 mg) and potassium chloride (60 mmol) within five hour period. This case indicates that more attention should be paid to clenbuterol widely used as a stimulant by athletes, especially by bodybuilders."
2018,29674003,Tanshinone IIA suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell signaling and anaphylaxis by activation of the Sirt1/LKB1/AMPK pathway.,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its upstream mediators liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) are generally known as key regulators of metabolism. We have recently reported that the AMPK pathway negatively regulates mast cell activation and anaphylaxis. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), an active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza extract that is currently used for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, shows anti-diabetic activity and improves insulin resistance in db/db mice through activation of AMPK. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-allergic activity of Tan IIA in vivo and to investigate the underlying mechanism in vitro in the context of AMPK signaling. The anti-allergic effect of Tan IIA was evaluated using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from AMPKα2-/- or Sirt1-/- mice, or BMMCs transfected with siRNAs specific for AMPKα2, LKB1, or Sirt1. AMPKα2-/- and Sirt1-/- mice were used to confirm the anti-allergic effect of Tan IIA in anaphylaxis in vivo. Tan IIA dose-dependently inhibited FcεRI-mediated degranulation and production of eicosanoids and cytokines in BMMCs. These inhibitory effects were diminished by siRNA-mediated knockdown or genetic deletion of AMPKα2 or Sirt1. Moreover, Tan IIA inhibited a mast cell-mediated local passive anaphylactic reaction in wild-type mice, but not in AMPKα2-/- or Sirt1-/- mice. In conclusion, Tan IIA suppresses FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis through activation of the inhibitory Sirt1-LKB1-AMPK pathway. Thus, Tan IIA may be useful as a new therapeutic agent for mast cell-mediated allergic diseases."
2010,20570586,1-Benzyl-indole-3-carbinol is a novel indole-3-carbinol derivative with significantly enhanced potency of anti-proliferative and anti-estrogenic properties in human breast cancer cells.,"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural autolysis product of a gluccosinolate present in Brassica vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage, has anti-proliferative and anti-estrogenic activities in human breast cancer cells. A new and significantly more potent I3C analogue, 1-benzyl-I3C was synthesized, and in comparison to I3C, this novel derivative displayed an approximate 1000-fold enhanced potency in suppressing the growth of both estrogen responsive (MCF-7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells (I3C IC(50) of 52 microM, and 1-benzyl-I3C IC(50) of 0.05 microM). At significantly lower concentrations, 1-benzyl-I3C induced a robust G1 cell cycle arrest and elicited the key I3C-specific effects on expression and activity of G1-acting cell cycle genes including the disruption of endogenous interactions of the Sp1 transcription factor with the CDK6 promoter. Furthermore, in estrogen responsive MCF-7 cells, with enhanced potency 1-benzyl-I3C down-regulated production of estrogen receptor-alpha protein, acts with tamoxifen to arrest breast cancer cell growth more effectively than either compound alone, and inhibited the in vivo growth of human breast cancer cell-derived tumor xenografts in athymic mice. Our results implicate 1-benzyl-I3C as a novel, potent inhibitor of human breast cancer proliferation and estrogen responsiveness that could potentially be developed into a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of indole-sensitive cancers."
2009,19335928,The mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of water-insoluble fish protein in ovariectomised rats.,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether water-insoluble fish protein (IFP) from Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) prevents hypercholesterolaemia induced by ovarian hormone deficiency. Wistar female rats, aged 6 months, were subjected to sham-operation or ovariectomy, and fed a cholesterol-free diet containing casein or IPF as a protein source for 28 d. Body-weight gain and food intake increased in the ovariectomised rats as compared with the sham-operated rats. Plasma total cholesterol concentration was decreased and faecal bile acid excretion was increased by IFP in the ovariectomised rats, but not in the sham-operated rats. Plasma homocysteine concentration was decreased by IFP in the ovariectomised rats, but not in the sham-operated rats. Liver lipids and liver cholesterol concentrations were increased and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity was decreased by ovariectomy, but not by diet. Bile acid content and the ratio of cholic acid groups to chenodeoxycholic acid groups in bile were increased by ovariectomy, but decreased by IFP. Bile acid content in the small intestine was increased by IFP in the ovariectomised rats, but not in the sham-operated rats. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and microsomal TAG transfer protein mRNA levels were decreased by ovariectomy and IFP, whereas LDL-receptor mRNA level was decreased by ovariectomy but unaffected by diet. Thus, the preventive effect of IFP on the ovarian hormone deficiency-associated increase in plasma cholesterol concentration seems to be mediated by accelerated faecal excretion of bile acids, coupled with an increase in the intestinal pool of bile acids."
2012,22980843,"Influence of harvest year, cultivar and geographical origin on Greek extra virgin olive oils composition: a study by NMR spectroscopy and biometric analysis.","Two hundred twenty-one extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) were extracted from four olive mono-cultivars (Koroneiki, Tsounati, Adramitini, and Throubolia) originated from four divisions of Greece (Peloponnesus, Crete, Zakynthos, and Lesvos) and collected in five harvesting periods (2002-2006 and 2007-2008). All samples were chemically analysed by means of (1)H and (31)P NMR spectroscopy and characterised according to their content in fatty acids, phenolic compounds, diacylglycerols, total free sterols, free acidity, and iodine number. The influence of cultivars on the compositional data of the EVOO samples according to harvest year and geographical origin was examined by means of the forward stepwise canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and classification binary trees (CBT). The CDA, when the a priori grouping was in accordance with harvest, was high (94%), whereas the classification in terms of groups formed by inclusions of geographical origin was reduced to 85%. Inclusion of both the harvesting year and geographical origin in the CDA analysis resulted in a high classification (90%) for the EVOO samples grouped into the four cultivars. The variables that most satisfactorily classified the Greek olive oils were the phenolics p-coumaric acid, pinoresinol, 1-acetoxypinoresinol, syringaresinol, luteolin, apigenin, and the hydrolysis products of oleuropein expressed collectively by the concentration of total hydroxytyrosol. Amongst the fatty acids, linoleic acid was the predictor with the highest discriminatory power. Finally, the phylogenetic significance of the olive oil compounds as determined by NMR was investigated by estimating their support to monophyly of cultivars."
2014,24393043,"Lectin coated MgO nanoparticle: its toxicity, antileishmanial activity, and macrophage activation.","The purpose of this research was to evaluate toxicity of uncoated magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs), MgO NPs coated with Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin, and PNA alone on the promastigotes of Leishmania major (L. major) and macrophages of BALB/c mice. On the other hand, antileishmanial property of uncoated MgO NPs, lectin coated MgO NPs, and PNA lectin alone was evaluated, and also macrophage activation was investigated after treatment with these materials by measurement of nitrite, H2O2, and some interleukins. This study showed that PNA lectin and lectin coated MgO NPs had approximately no toxicity on L. major and macrophages, but some toxic effects were observed for uncoated MgO NPs, especially at concentration of 500 µg/mL. Interestingly, lectin coated MgO NPs had the highest antileishmanial activity and macrophage activation, compared with uncoated MgO NPs and PNA lectin."
2017,27819684,Tacrolimus plus sirolimus with or without ATG as GVHD prophylaxis in HLA-mismatched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"HLA-matched related or unrelated donors are not universally available. Consequently, patients can be offered hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from alternative donors, including mismatched unrelated donors (MMURD), known to cause a higher incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD. In vivo T-cell-depletion strategies, such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy, significantly decrease the risk of GVHD. We performed a multicenter, retrospective study comparing tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SIR) with or without ATG in 104 patients (TAC-SIR=45, TAC-SIR-ATG=59) who underwent MMURD HSCT. Use of ATG was associated with a lower incidence, albeit not statistically significant, of grades 2-4 aGVHD (46% vs 64%, P=0.09), no difference in grades 3-4 aGVHD (10% vs 15%, P=0.43), a trend for a lower incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD (16% vs 37%, P=0.09) and more frequent Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (54% vs 18%, P=0.0002). There were no statistically significant differences in 3-year overall survival (OS) (TAC-SIR-ATG=40% (95% confidence interval (CI)=24-56%) vs TAC-SIR=54% (95% CI=37-70%), P=0.43) or 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression (TAC-SIR-ATG=40% (95% CI=28-58%) vs TAC-SIR=22% (95% CI=13-39%), P=0.92). An intermediate Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research disease risk resulted in a significantly lower non-relapse mortality and better OS at 3 years. Our study suggests that addition of ATG to TAC-SIR in MMURD HSCT does not affect OS when compared with TAC-SIR alone."
2019,30943761,"Behavioral and molecular effects of intrahippocampal infusion of auraptene, resveratrol, and curcumin on H-89-induced deficits on spatial memory acquisition and retention in Morris water maze.","Our aim was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, auraptene, and curcumin on the spatial learning and spatial memory retention in the Morris water maze (MWM). The effects of 4-day bilateral intrahippocampal (i.h.) infusions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), H-89 as a protein kinase AII inhibitor, auraptene/H-89, resveratrol/H-89, and curcumin/H-89 were investigated on spatial memory acquisition in MWM. The rats were trained for 4 days; each day included one block of four trials. Post-training probe tests were performed on day 5 in acquisition test. For retention assessments, different animals were trained for 4 days and then infused (i.h.) with either DMSO, H-89, auraptene/H-89, resveratrol/H-89, or curcumin/H-89. The retention test was performed 48 h after the last training trial. The bilateral infusion of H-89 led to a significant impairment in spatial memory in acquisition and retention tests accompanied with a significant decrease in expressions of cAMP response-element binding (CREB) and pCREB proteins in hippocampus. Resveratrol and curcumin reversed the H-89-induced spatial memory acquisition and retention impairments with significant increases in both CREB and pCREB proteins expressions compared to H-89-treated animals. Auraptene showed significant effects in reversing H-89-induced impairments in spatial memory retention but not spatial memory acquisition."
2010,19747768,Expression of sulfotransferases and sulfatases in human breast cancer: impact on resveratrol metabolism.,"Resveratrol is a naturally occurring anticancer compound present in grapes and wine that undergoes pronounced metabolism in human intestine and liver. In order to determine whether resveratrol is also bio-transformed in human breast carcinoma, metabolism experiments were conducted in breast tumor and adjacent non-tumorous specimens from 13 patients. Resveratrol was metabolized in cytosolic tissue fractions to resveratrol-3-O-sulfate: the formation rates were up to 33.5-fold higher in cancer samples than in peritumoral tissue. Further quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed similar expression of sulfotransferases SULT1A2, 1A3, and 1E1 in the paired control and tumor tissues. Sulfotransferase SULT1A1 expression was below the detection limit in all samples. Interestingly, mRNA expression of steroid sulfatase STS, but not of arylsulfatases ARS-A and ARS-B, was significantly higher (p<0.0017) in non-malignant specimens than in tumor tissue samples, which might explain the higher resveratrol-3-O-sulfate concentrations in breast cancer specimens. Cellular localization of SULT1A3 and STS was also assessed by indirect immunofluorescence on paraffin-embedded sections from control and malignant breast tissue clearly showing a correlation of qRT-PCR data with protein expression of these two enzymes. Our data elucidate the metabolism of resveratrol in malignant and non-malignant breast tissue, which must be considered in humans after oral uptake of dietary resveratrol as a chemopreventive agent."
2000,10817666,Cytotoxicity of capsaicin in monkey kidney cells: lack of antagonistic effects of capsazepine and Ruthenium red.,"Capsaicin is a natural product of Capsicum peppers, excitatory effects of which have been shown to be mediated by the recently cloned vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1). Since previous studies have shown that capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis, experiments were performed to investigate whether this effect is mediated by VR1 receptor on cultured monkey kidney cells (Vero cells). The capsaicin uptake was assessed in cellular homogenate and in medium by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and quantification on C18 reverse-phase column and fluorescence detection. Toxic effects were assessed by incorporation of [3H]L-leucine into cellular proteins in the presence of capsazepine, the VR1 vanilloid receptor antagonist and Ruthenium red or tyrosine or calcium. Capsazepine (1 to 256 microM) did not modify the uptake rate of capsaicin for incubation times up to 24 h and did not antagonize capsaicin-induced protein synthesis inhibition. It rather inhibited protein synthesis per se from 100 to 256 microM. Ruthenium red which blocks mitochondrial calcium uptake, inhibited protein synthesis and did not antagonise or increase synergistically the effects of capsaicin. Interestingly in a medium deprived of calcium and supplemented by calcium chloride (10-50 microM) the protein synthesis inhibition induced by capsaicin is antagonised somehow. There was no prevention of capsaicin diffusion into the cells. Tyrosine, which seems to be the best preventive agent of capsaicin inhibitory effects, prevents its metabolism but not its diffusion. Capsaicin might enter cells by diffusion and interfere with protein synthesis machinery by competition with tyrosine which in turn prevents the metabolism of capsaicin. The results of the present study suggest that cell responses to capsaicin may be transduced through at least two molecular pathways, one involving VR1, since the receptor antagonist capsazepine fails to prevent the inhibitory effect of capsaicin in Vero cells of renal origin."
2016,27316789,Chronic treatment with resveratrol improves overactive bladder in obese mice via antioxidant activity.,"The objective of the present work was to evaluate whether oral intake with resveratrol ameliorates overactive bladder in high-fat fed mice. Male C57BL6 mice fed with standard chow or high-fat diet to induce obesity received a two-week therapy with resveratrol (100mg/kg, given as a daily gavage). Weight and metabolic profile, together with cystometry and in vitro bladder contractions were evaluated. Measurements of gp91phox and SOD1 mRNA expressions and reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in bladder tissues, and serum TBARS were performed. Obese mice exhibited increases in body weight and epididymal fat mass, which were significantly reduced by oral treatment with resveratrol. Cystometric study in obese mice showed increases in non-voiding contractions, post-voiding pressure and voiding frequency that were reversed by resveratrol treatment. Likewise, the in vitro bladder overactivity in response to electrical-field stimulation (80V, 1-32Hz) or carbachol (1nM to 10mM) were normalized by resveratrol. The gp91phox and SOD1 mRNA expressions in bladder tissues were markedly higher in obese mice compared with lean group. In addition, ROS levels in bladder tissues and serum lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay) were markedly higher in obese compared with lean mice, all of which were reduced by resveratrol treatment. In lean group, resveratrol had no effect in any parameter evaluated. Our results show that two-week therapy of obese mice with resveratrol reduces the systemic and bladder oxidative stress, and greatly ameliorated the cystometry alterations and in vitro bladder overactivity. Resveratrol treatment could be an option to prevent obesity-associated overactive bladder. "
2017,28108221,Sirtuin 1 independent effects of resveratrol in INS-1E β-cells.,"Resveratrol (Resv), a natural polyphenol, is suggested to have various health benefits including improved insulin sensitivity. Resv activates Sirtuin (Sirt1) in several species and tissues. Sirt1 is a protein deacetylase with an important role in ageing, metabolism and β-cell function. In insulinoma β-cells (INS-1E), Resv is previously shown to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in a Sirt1-dependent mechanism and to protect against β-cell dedifferentiation in non-human primates, while inducing hypertrophy in myoblasts. Mammalian (mechanistic) Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and regulates the cell size, β-cell survival and proliferation. In order to understand the interaction of Sirt1 and mTOR cascade activity with Resv-induced changes in the INS-1E cell line, we generated stable Sirt1-down-regulated INS-1E cells, and analysed Sirt1-dependent effects of Resv with respect to mTOR cascade activity. Sirt1-knockdown (KD) had a significant increase in cell size compared to negative-control (NEG CTR) cells. Resveratrol treatment increased cell size in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h (Resv conc: 15-60 μM), and decreased the cell number (Resv conc: 30-60 μM). Cell area was increased in NEG CTR cells (Resv conc: 60 μM) at 24 h and KD cells at 48 h (Resv conc: 15-60 μM). Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, counteracted the Resv-induced cell enlargement (both cell diameter and area). Furthermore, Sirt1-downregulation by itself did not affect the mTOR cascade activities as measured by Western blotting for total and phosphorylated Akt and mTOR. Rapamycin decreased the mTORC1 activity, while increasing the pAkt levels. Resveratrol did not interfere with the mTOR activity or with Sirt1 expression. Altogether, this work indicates that Sirt1 is a negative regulator of cell size. Moreover, the effect of Resv on cell size increase is mTOR-cascade dependent."
2014,24128545,"Simultaneous separation and determination of fructose, sorbitol, glucose and sucrose in fruits by HPLC-ELSD.","A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) was optimised for simultaneous determination of fructose, sorbitol, glucose and sucrose in fruits. The analysis was carried out on a Phenomenex Luna 5u NH₂ 100A column (250 mm × 4.60mm, 5 micron) with isocratic elution of acetonitrile:water (82.5:17.5, v/v). Drift tube temperature of the ELSD system was set to 82 °C and nitrogen flow rate was 2.0 L min⁻¹. The regression equation revealed good linear relationship (R = 0.9967-0.9989) within test ranges. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for four analytes (peach, apple, watermelon, and cherry fruits) were in the range of 0.07-0.27 and 0.22-0.91 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The proposed HPLC-ELSD method was validated for quantification of sugars in peach, apple, watermelon, and cherry fruits, and the results were satisfactory. The results showed that the contents of the four sugars varied among fruits. While fructose (5.79-104.01 mg g⁻¹) and glucose (9.25-99.62 mg g⁻¹) emerged as common sugars in the four fruits, sorbitol (8.70-19.13 mg g⁻¹) were only found in peach, apple and cherry fruits, and sucrose (15.82-106.39 mg g⁻¹) were in peach, apple and watermelon. There was not detectable sorbitol in watermelon and sucrose in cherry fruits, respectively."
,2399675,[The vitamin B6 allowance of hypertension patients and the effect of dietotherapy].,"A total of 111 patients with essential hypertension (the II stage) and obesity (the II degree) were investigated for providing with vitamin B6. The functional methods used for the vitamin assay (ACT activity of red blood cells and pyrodoxale-5-phosphate effect) have revealed significant vitamin B6 deficiency in 81.1% of the patients. Vitamin B6 deficiency was intensified in the course of the dietotherapy. Correction of vitamin B6 deficiency with a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (20 mg/day) during 20-22 days, in the presence of the diet, has promoted optimization of providing with vitamin B6: normalization of pyrodoxale-5-phosphate effect. The hypotensive effect and decrease of excessive body mass in patients who received dietotherapy and pyridoxine (20 mg/day) were more pronounced than in those who received the same diet and the multivitamin ""Undevitum""."
2016,26433287,Protein content and amino acids profile of pseudocereals.,"Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) represent the main protein source in several diets, although these pseudocereals are not currently present in the FCDB nutrient profile information. The aim of this work is to characterise the AA profile of these pseudocereals and compare them with rice. Total protein content revealed to vary from 16.3g/100g (quinoa Salta) to 13.1g/100g (buckwheat) and lower values were found in rice samples (6.7g/100g). For pseudocereals the most abundant essential AA was leucine. Quinoa-Salta evidences the highest leucine content (1013mg/100g) and the minor methionine content (199mg/100g). Buckwheat was the cereal with the highest phenylalanine content (862mg/100g). Rice (Oryza sativa) presents the lowest content for all AA. Results showed pseudocereals as the best source of AA. EuroFIR guidelines where strictly followed and proved to be a crucial tool to guarantee data interchangeability and comparability. "
2015,26102565,"Aegeline from Aegle marmelos stimulates glucose transport via Akt and Rac1 signaling, and contributes to a cytoskeletal rearrangement through PI3K/Rac1.","Aegeline is an alkaloidal-amide, isolated from the leaves of Aegle marmelos and have shown antihyperglycemic as well as antidyslipidemic activities in the validated animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here we delineate, aegeline enhanced GLUT4 translocation mediated 2-deoxy-glucose uptake in both time and concentration-dependent manner. 2-deoxy-glucose uptake was completely stymied by the transport inhibitors (wortmannin and genistein) in C2C12 myotubes. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) suggest that both Akt and Rac1 operate aegeline-stimulated glucose transport via distinct parallel pathways. Moreover, aegeline activates p21 protein-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and cofilin (an actin polymerization regulator). Rac1 inhibitor (Rac1 inhib II) and PAK1 inhibitor (IPA-3) completely blocked aegeline-induced phosphorylation of cofilin and p21 protein-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In summary, these findings suggest that aegeline stimulates the glucose transport through Akt and Rac1 dependent distinct parallel pathways and have cytoskeletal roles via stimulation of the PI3-kinase-Rac1-PAK1-cofilin pathway in the skeletal muscle cells. Therefore, multiple targets of aegeline in the improvement of insulin sensitivity of the skeletal muscle cells may be suggested. "
2019,30573225,Hemorrhagic risk and intracranial complications in patients with minor head injury (MHI) taking different oral anticoagulants.,"The correlation between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or Vitamin K Antagonist (VKAs) intake and the incidence of intracranial complications after minor head injury (MHI) is still object of debate: preliminary observation seems to demonstrate lower incidence in intracranial bleeding complications (ICH) in patients taking DOACs than VKA. METHODS. This prospective and observational study was performed to clarify the incidence of ICH in patients in DOACs compared to VKAs. Between January 2016 and April 2018 we have recorded in our ED patients with MHI taking oral anticoagulants. Their hemorragic risk score was calculated and recorded for each patient (Has Bled, Atria and Orbit). RESULTS A total of 402 patients with MHI taking anticoagulant were collected: 226 were receiving one of the four DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban) while 176 patients were in therapy with VKA. The rate of intracranial complications was significantly lower in patients receiving DOACs than in patients treated with VKA (p < 0.01). In the VKA group two patients died because of intracranial bleeding. No deaths were recorded in the DOACs group. DISCUSSION patients with MHI who take DOACs have a significant lower incidence of intracranial bleeding complications than those treated with vitamin k antagonists. This statement is supported by the observation that the hemorrhagic risk, measured according to the chosen scores, was similar between the two groups."
2010,20642557,Effect of high-dose cranberry juice on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin in patients.,"Case reports suggest an association between cranberry juice and potentiation of warfarin. Studies using 240 ml of cranberry juice daily demonstrated no interaction. It is unknown if higher amounts of cranberry juice will interact with warfarin.Cranberry juice at 240 ml twice daily does not alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin.To determine if high-dose cranberry juice (240 ml twice daily) alters the pharmacodynamic action of warfarin.Ten male patients taking stable doses of warfarin were given cranberry juice at 240 ml twice daily for 7 days. Prothrombin times were drawn at baseline and days 2, 6 and 8 after administration of the juice. Prothrombin times were averaged for each day and mean times were compared from each study day to baseline using repeated measures ANOVA.There was no statistical difference between mean prothrombin time at baseline and any day tested during juice administration.Cranberry juice (240 ml twice daily for 1 week) did not alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin in patients."
2019,30530043,"Effect of antiepileptic drug (Topiramate) and cold pressed ginger oil on testicular genes expression, sexual hormones and histopathological alterations in mice.","Sexual dysfunction in the epileptic patient is difficult to confirm whether it is ailment or therapy related. Antiepileptic drugs often use in reproductive age, through reproductive progress and maturation. On the other side, cold-pressed oils are rich in bioactive phytochemicals with health-promoting traits. The target of this work was to appraise the sexual dysfunction of antiepileptic Topiramate (TPM) and cold pressed ginger oil (CPGO) as antiepileptic alternative medicine in male mice. Fifty-four adult male albino mice were divided into nine groups (n = 6 mice). One group given saline and used as negative control; another one was given corn oil as vehicle. Six groups administered orally with TPM or CPGO at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg. Moreover, group of animals co-administrated orally CPGO with TPM (400 mg/kg) to study their interaction. Fatty acid profile and tocols composition of CPGO were determined. in vitro assays were undertaken to evaluate radical scavenging traits of CPGO utilizing sable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) and galvinoxyl radicals. The study investigated antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, sexual hormones levels, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa), synaptonemal complex protein (Sycp3), Wilms tumor gene (Wt1) as well as histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Strong radical scavenging potential of CPGO against stable DPPH· and galvinoxyl radicals was recorded. The results revealed that TPM caused a dose-dependent reduction in the antioxidant activities and testosterone content, while, malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) as oxidative stress markers were elevated. Vegfa and Sycp3 mRNA expression down-regulated at all Topiramate tested doses, but Wt1 up-regulated at 400 mg/kg. TPM (400 mg/kg) revealed histological alterations associated with strong positive Bax immune reactive spermatogoneal and Leydig cells. Ginger oil elevated the CAT and SOD (antioxidant enzymes), serum testosterone and diminished the oxidative stress, up regulated the expression of Vegfa and Sycp3 and down-regulated the Wt1 expression. Meanwhile, CPGO revealed no histopathological alterations and no Bax immune-reactive cells. CPGO co-administration with TPM (400 mg/kg) attenuated the TPM toxicity. High doses of TPM may exhibit sexual dysfunction but CPGO is safe and has androgenic property. CPGO co-administration could protect the antiepileptic patient from the TPM sexual dysfunction."
2015,25654132,Enhancing the decolorizing and degradation ability of bacterial consortium isolated from textile effluent affected area and its application on seed germination.,"A bacterial consortium BMP1/SDSC/01 consisting of six isolates was isolated from textile effected soil, sludge, and textile effluent from Hudiara drain near Nishat Mills Limited, Ferozepur Road, Lahore, Pakistan. It was selected because of being capable of degrading and detoxifying red, green, black, and yellow textile dyes. The pH and supplements were optimized to enhance the decolorization ability of the selected consortium. The results indicated that decolorizing ability of consortium for the red, green, black, and yellow dyes was higher as compared to individual strains. The consortium was able to decolorize 84%, 84%, 85%, 85%, and 82% of 200 ppm of red, green, black, yellow, and mixed dyes within 24 h while individual strain required 72 h. On supplementing urea, the consortium decolorized 87, 86, 89, 86, and 83%, respectively, while on supplementing sodium chloride the consortium decolorized 93, 94, 93, 94, and 89% of red, green, black, yellow, and mixed dyes, respectively, which was maximum while in the presence of ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride it showed intermediate results. The effect of untreated and treated dyes was investigated on Zea mays L. (maize) and Sorghum vulgare Pers. (sorghum). This study will help to promote an efficient biotreatment of textile effluents."
2014,24888906,The quantification of reticulocyte maturation and neocytolysis in normal and erythropoietin stimulated rats.,"A technique has recently been proposed for obtaining the reticulocyte (RET) age distribution from the flow cytometric reticulocyte count. It allows for a quantitative characterization of reticulocyte dynamics. In this work this technique was applied to characterize the blood, bone marrow and spleen reticulocytes in homeostatic and erythropoietically stimulated rats in order to determine the reticulocyte maturation times in the bone marrow and blood; and to confirm the presence of ineffective erythropoiesis (neocytolysis). The latter was done by comparing the reticulocyte removal rate from blood with bilirubin formation after erythropoiesis stimulation. A single subcutaneous dose (4050 IU/kg) of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was administered to rats, then their reticulocytes were stained with thiazole orange and the distribution of the fluorescent signal measured using flow cytometry. The obtained signal distribution of the reticulocytes was transformed to the age distribution and a set of basic parameters reflecting reticulocyte dynamics was determined. Bilirubin concentrations were measured to directly assess the presence of reticulocyte irreversible removal. The bilirubin formation was found to be considerably modulated by rHuEPO and corresponded well to the determined reticulocyte removal rate. The initial increase and subsequent decrease of the reticulocyte maturation time in blood was quantitated and directly linked with RET mobilization from the bone marrow. A substantial number (60%) of reticulocytes is sequestrated during homeostasis in rats. This number increases and then decreases after rHuEPO administration, as also reflected by bilirubin formation. Flow cytometry seems to be an excellent method for studying RET dynamics and the presence of young RBC neocytolysis."
,11911254,A quantitative angiogenesis model for efficacy testing of chemopreventive agents.,"One of the approaches in chemoprevention to prevent or delay the progression of precancerous lesions, is to apply chemopreventive agents that can potentially block angiogenesis. A quantitative in vivo angiogenesis inhibition assay was developed to test the efficacy of twelve chemopreventive agents that represent different chemical classes and multiple biological activities, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and an oncogene-transfected angiogenic cell line (6 Ti ras/SV myc # 4). These tumorigenic cells held by a primary agarose pellet, were placed alone or with a secondary pellet incorporating five concentrations of the test agent, on an exposed CAM of 7-day-old chick embryo for 72 hours in a humidified chamber at 35 degrees C. The cell-induced angiogenic blood vessels, including the microvessels radiating from the cell pellet focal area, were scored using a computerized custom image analysis system. The results show that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS); aspirin, sulindac, sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone, were effective inhibitors of cell-induced angiogenesis (23-66%). Aspirin displayed a dose-dependent response with the highest inhibition at 300 microM and an EC50 (the effective molar concentration that inhibits angiogenesis by 50%) of 26 microM. Sulindac sulfone was more effective than sulindac with an EC50 of 5 microM versus 85 microM. However, sulindac sulfide showed an intermediate response with an EC50 of 41 microM. The retinoids; all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) were also highly effective inhibitors of cell-mediated CAM-angiogenesis. 13-cis-RA with an EC50 of 3.6 nM, has been the most efficacious test agent. > 400-fold more effective than 9-cis-RA (1.5 microM). ATRA exhibited an intermediate response between 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA with an EC50 of 0.3 microM, and was 100-fold more efficacious than 9-cis-RA. However, the synthetic retinoid, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), was not an effective inhibitor of CAM angiogenesis. Thalidomide, a compound with multiple biological activities, exhibited dose-dependent inhibition ranging from 10-1000 microM with an EC50 of 19 microM. Other agents that exhibited dose-dependent inhibition included Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI), EC50: 10 microg/ml, tamoxifen, EC50, 0.05 microM and difluoromethyl omithine (DFMO), with an EC50 of 13 microM. These results suggest that tumor-associated angiogenesis can be modulated by non-toxic concentrations of chemopreventive agents representing multiple biological activities and multiple targets."
2013,23871004,Buckwheat trypsin inhibitor enters Hep G2 cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis.,"Recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (rBTI) was studied to evaluate if it could enter cancer cells and to determine the mechanism. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (FITC-BTI) entered Hep G2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. FITC-BTI colocalised with labelled transferrin (Tf) in the punctate structure, implying that rBTI enters Hep G2 cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Incubation of Hep G2 cells with different chemical inhibitors abolished diffuse, but not punctate fluorescence, thus indicating that membrane potential plays a critical role in this process. Impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by RNAi with clathrin heavy chain greatly reduced or completely abolished both diffuse and punctate fluorescence, further supporting a theory of a single route of endocytosis. Consistent with our working hypothesis, Hep G2 cells which were arrested in the M phase did not show any vesicular or diffuse FITC-BTI. We conclude from these results that both endocytosis and membrane potential are required for rBTI entry into Hep G2 cells. "
2013,24235882,"Thiamine deficiency induced neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and neuropsychological alterations: a reappraisal.","Nutritional deficiency can cause, mainly in chronic alcoholic subjects, the Wernicke encephalopathy and its chronic neurological sequela, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). Long-term chronic ethanol abuse results in hippocampal and cortical cell loss. Thiamine deficiency also alters principally hippocampal- and frontal cortical-dependent neurochemistry; moreover in WKS patients, important pathological damage to the diencephalon can occur. In fact, the amnesic syndrome typical for WKS is mainly due to the damage in the diencephalic-hippocampal circuitry, including thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies. The loss of cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain region results in decreased cholinergic input to the hippocampus and the cortex and reduced choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities and function, as well as in acetylcholine receptor downregulation within these brain regions. In this narrative review, we will focus on the neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and neuropsychological studies shedding light on the effects of thiamine deficiency in experimental models and in humans.

,10345150,Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) in the treatment of equilibrium disorders.,"In an open, controlled study, 44 patients complaining of vertigo, dizziness, or both, caused by vascular vestibular disorders were randomly treated with extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) 80 mg twice daily or with betahistine dihydrochloride (BI) 16 mg twice daily for 3 months. A complete neuro-otologic and equilibrimetric examination was performed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, with evaluation of clinical findings. In the first month of therapy, vertigo and dizziness improved in 64.7% of patients treated with BI and in 65% of those who received EGb 761. Compared to baseline, no statistically significant changes were observed in cranial scans for patients with a ""central"" cranial pattern. Likewise, no changes versus baseline were observed in both groups for the equilibrium score. The comprehensive test battery showed the following findings: EGb 761 induced a slight decrease of saccadic delay and considerably increased saccadic velocities; BI improved saccadic accuracy but did not modify delay; EGb 761 improved smooth pursuit gain at 0.4 Hz 40 degrees/s three times more than BI; both drugs asymmetrically reduced nystagmus maximum velocity at 40 degrees/s; both drugs asymmetrically improved the sinusoidal vestibulo-ocular reflex; BI considerably reduced--whereas EGb 761 considerably improved--visuovestibular ocular reflex. No side effects were recorded during the trial except for transient mild headache and gastric upset in 2 patients receiving EGb 761 and transient cyanosis of nails and lips in 1 patient given BI. These results suggest that EGb 761 and BI operate at different equilibrium receptor sites and show that EGb 761 can considerably improve oculomotor and visuovestibular function."
2016,26213048,Physicochemical characterization of pomegranate wines fermented with three different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains.,"Three commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains: Viniferm Revelación, Viniferm SV and Viniferm PDM were evaluated for the production of pomegranate wine from a juice coupage of the two well-known varieties Mollar and Wonderfull. Further malolactic fermentation was carried out spontaneously. The same fermentation patterns were observed for pH, titratable acidity, density, sugar consumption, and ethanol and glycerol production. Glucose was exhausted while fructose residues remained at the end of alcoholic fermentation. A high ethanol concentration (10.91 ± 0.27% v/v) in combination with 1.49 g/L glycerol was achieved. Citric acid concentration increased rapidly a 31.7%, malic acid disappeared as result of malolactic fermentation and the lactic acid levels reached values between 0.40 and 0.96 g/L. The analysis of CIEa parameter and total anthocyanin content highlights a lower degradation of monomeric anthocyanins during winemaking with Viniferm PDM yeast. The resulting wine retains a 34.5% of total anthocyanin content of pomegranate juice blend."
2008,18387868,Onion decreases the ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in young adult rats.,"It has been suggested that fruit and vegetable consumption are associated with good bone health. Onion, in particular, has been verified in its efficacy in bone resorption activity. In this study, we further investigated the effects of an onion-containing diet on ovariectomy-induced bone loss using methods of serum marker assay, histomorphometric analysis and biomechanical tests. Sixty-four female Wistar rats (14-week-old) with sham operations or ovariectomy were assigned to 6 groups: CON, sham-operated control group; OVX, ovariectomized group; ALN, ovariectomized rats treated with alendronate (1 mg/kg/day, p.o.); and 3% ON, 7% ON and 14% ON, ovariectomized rats fed with diets containing 3%, 7% and 14% (wt/wt) onion powder, respectively. Animals were sacrificed after a six-week treatment course. In the serum marker assay, alendronate and all three onion-enriched diets significantly decreased serum calcium level (p<0.05). Both 14% ON group and the ALN group even showed similarly lower level of serum osteocalcin (p<0.05), suggesting a down-regulation of bone turnover. The histomorphometric analysis showed that ovariectomy markedly decrease bone trabeculae. The ALN and 14% ON rats were 80% and 46% higher, respectively, in BV/TV than the OVX rats (p<0.05), and the rats fed with onion-enriched food showed a lesser ovariectomy-induced bone loss in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, both ALN and 14% ON groups had significantly more trabecular number, less separated trabeculae, and fewer osteoclasts (p<0.05), but the protective efficacy from the 14% onion-enriched diet was slightly inferior to that of alendronate. Ovariectomy also significantly decreased tissue weight and biomechanical strength in the OVX group (p<0.05). The ALN and 14% ON groups equivalently showed a lesser decrease in tissue weight, though the difference was not significant. On the other hand, both the ALN and 14% ON groups represented similar biomaterial properties of femurs, and both reduced the ovariectomy-induced decrease in bending load and bending energy (p<0.05). The present study further verified that an onion-enriched diet could counteract ovariectomy-induced bone loss and deterioration of biomechanical properties."

One-milliliter volumes of 2-chloroprocaine, 3%; tetracaine, 1%; lidocaine, 2%; bupivacaine, 0.75%; or sodium chloride, 0.2%; were injected with a 30-gauge needle beneath the mesoneurium but exterior to the epineurium. The wound was closed and the animals were normally maintained until the nerves were reexposed for quantitative biophysical and morphologic testing 24 h to 4 weeks later. The results indicate that topically applied 2-chloroprocaine and tetracaine produce significant endoneurial edema 48 h after treatment. Horseradish peroxidase was used to verify increased permeability of the perineurium. Endoneurial fluid pressure was significantly increased in edematous nerves. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal mast cells and proliferation of endoneurial fibroblasts in addition to Schwann cell injury and axonal dystrophy. This study shows that extrafascicular administration of clinically used concentrations of local anesthetic solutions can alter perineurial permeability, producing changes in the endoneurial environment that are associated with neurotoxic injury. Perineurial and endoneurial fibrotic changes may be a late consequence of peripheral nerve injury with anesthetic solutions producing altered perineurial permeability with endoneurial edema."
2009,19432881,Enhancement of antitumor natural killer cell activation by orally administered Spirulina extract in mice.,"Oral administration of hot-water extract of Spirulina, cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis, leads to augmentation of NK cytotoxicity in humans. Here, we applied to syngeneic tumor-implant mice (C57BL/6 versus B16 melanoma) Spirulina to elucidate the mechanism of raising antitumor NK activation. A B16D8 subcell line barely expressed MHC class I but about 50% expressed Rae-1, a ligand for NK activation receptor NKG2D. The Rae-1-positive population of implant B16 melanoma was effectively eliminated in the tumor mass progressed in mice. This antitumor activity was induced in parallel with IFN-gamma and abolished in mice by treatment with asialoGM-1 but not CD8beta Ab, suggesting the effector is NK cell. NK cell activation occurred in the spleen of wild-type mice medicated with Spirulina. This Spirulina-mediated enhanced NK activation was abrogated in MyD88 -/- mice but not in TICAM-1 -/- mice. The NK activating properties of Spirulina depending on MyD88 were confirmed with in vitro bone marrow-derived dendritic cells expressing TLR2/4. In D16D8 tumor challenge studies, the antitumor effect of Spirulina was abolished in MyD88 -/- mice. Hence, orally administered Spirulina enhances tumoricidal NK activation through the MyD88 pathway. Spirulina exerted a synergistic antitumor activity with BCG-cell wall skeleton, which is known to activate the MyD88 pathway via TLR2/4 with no NK enhancing activity. Spirulina and BCG-cell wall skeleton synergistically augmented IFN-gamma production and antitumor potential in the B16D8 versus C57BL/6 system. We infer from these results that NK activation by Spirulina has some advantage in combinational use with BCG-cell wall skeleton for developing adjuvant-based antitumor immunotherapy."
2017,28236622,"Antidiabetic, Antioxidant, and Hypolipidemic Potential of Sonchus asper Hill.","Context • The recently growing occurrence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world is of immense concern. Sonchus asper Hill (SA) is traditionally used in the treatment of diabetes and urinary disorders in Pakistan. Objective • The present study intended to evaluate the antidiabetic activity of a Sonchus asper methanol extract (SAME) in rats. Design • Thirty male, Sprague-Dawley rats, from 180 to 190 g each, were randomly divided into 5 groups of 6 rats each and received the following treatments: (1) group 1 (untreated control group) administered distilled water only; (2) group 2 administered 200 mg/kg of SAME only; (3) group 3 (diabetic control group) administered 55 mg/kg body weight (BW) of streptozotocin (STZ) in distilled water to induce diabetes; (4) group 4 administered 55 mg/kg BW of STZ in distilled water to induce diabetes and given 100 mg/kg of SAME; and (5) group 5 administered 55 mg/kg BW of STZ to induce diabetes and administered 200 mg/kg of SAME. Setting • The study was conducted in the Department of Biotechnology Bannu (Bannu, Pakistan). Outcome Measures • The research team performed (1) a serum analysis for glucose, lipase, and insulin; (2) a measurement of the protein concentration of the supernatant from pancreatic tissue; (3) an assay of catalase activity; (4) an assay of superoxide activity; (5) an assessment of lipid peroxidation enzymes; (6) an assay of glutathione-S-transferase activity; (7) an assay of glutathione reductase activity; (8) an assay of glutathione-peroxidase activity; and (9) an assay of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) activity. Results • The administration of STZ caused significant alterations in the blood glucose levels, the lipase activity, insulin secretions, cholesterol profiles, serum marker enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, and contents of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the rats (P < .01). On oral administration, the SAME showed statistically significant effects by improving the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, TBARS contents, and cholesterol profile of the diabetic rats (P < .01). In treatment, the glucose and insulin levels of the SAME rats were significantly lower than the diabetic rats on day 21 (P < .01). Conclusions • The findings suggest that the significant antidiabetic potential of the SAME in ameliorating the diabetic conditions in diabetic rats might be due to the presence of the bioactive constituents in the extract."
2007,17392109,Protective effect of Portulaca oleracea extracts on hypoxic nerve tissue and its mechanism.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether Portulaca oleracea (PO) extracts have hypoxic neuroprotective effects and if so, by what mechanism. After being orally administrated with the PO extracts or distilled water for seven days, adult male BALB/c mice were adapted to a normobaric low oxygen environment (10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen) for different time and then were sacrificed. The mouse cortices were used for histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin (H-E staining). The activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactic acid (LD) and the level of lactate dehydroenase (LDH) and ATP were detected, and the mRNA and protein levels of EPO in the cortices were analyzed. PC-12 cells and primarily cultured nerve cells were used for 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The degree of LDH in the cell culture medium was tested. The results showed that the PO extracts enhanced the EPO mRNA and protein expression in the mouse cortices. Compared to the control group, the mouse in the group treated with the PO extracts by 1 g/d had significantly higher activities of PF, PFK, LDH and higher levels of ATP in the cortices, especially under the hypoxic environment for 24 hours. Histological analysis indicated that the extracts lessened the inflammation damage of the mouse brain. MTT assay results showed the PO extracts or the herb-containing serum raised the viability of the cells under the tested hypoxic conditions and decreased the degree of LDH in the culture medium in a dose-dependent manner. We thus demonstrated that the PO extracts had protective effects on hypoxic nerve tissue."
2014,25591183,"Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout.","Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi. "
2016,27459120,Thymoquinone: An edible redox-active quinone for the pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative conditions and glial brain tumors. A short review.,"There exist few efficient agents in the neurological and neurosurgical armamentarium for treatment of neurotrauma, refractory seizures and high grade glial tumors. Pathophysiological conditions of diverse neural injuries have converging common pathways including oxidative stress and apoptosis. Targeted therapies have been throughly investigated, but limited success has been achieved until now. Phytochemical drugs may provide easily achievable and cheap adjunctive sources. Thymoquinone is an edible quinone obtained from Nigella sativa seed oil and exerts powerful antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activities in experimental models. Recently emerging studies conducted with animal models suggest that thymoquinone - bearing a very simple molecular structure - significantly crosses the blood brain barrier and exerts neuromodulatory activities. Indeed, in animal studies, the following actions of thymoquinone were demonstrated: 1-Protection against ischemic brain damage. 2-Reduction of epileptic seizures and associated cerebral oxidative injury. 3-Reduction of morphine tolerance and associated oxidative brain damage. 4-Anxiolytic effects and reduction of immobility stress-associated cerebral oxidative injury. 5-Reduction of diabetes-induced cerebral oxidative stress, 6-Reduction of cerebral oxidative injuries induced by noxious exposures including toluene, lead and ionizing radiation. Substantial in vitro data suggest that thymoquinone may be beneficial in treatment of glial tumors. However, there is no clinical study investigating its antitumor effects. In fact, thymoquinone suppresses growth and invasion, and induces apoptosis of glial tumor cells via degrading tubulins and inhibiting 20S proteasome, telomerase, autophagy, FAK and metalloproteinases. A simple and easily available agent may be a promising adjunctive treatment option in neurological and neurosurgical practice."
1994,8024628,Free radicals scavenging action and anti-enzyme activities of procyanidines from Vitis vinifera. A mechanism for their capillary protective action.,"The scavenging by procyanidines (polyphenol oligomers from Vitis vinifera seeds, CAS 85594-37-2) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the onset (HO degrees) and the maintenance of microvascular injury (lipid radicals R degrees, RO degrees, ROO degrees) has been studied in phosphatidylcholine liposomes (PCL), using two different models of free radical generation: a) iron-promoted and b) ultrasound-induced lipid peroxidation. In a) lipid peroxidation was assessed by determination of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS); in b) by determination of conjugated dienes, formation of breakdown carbonyl products (as 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones) and loss of native phosphatidylcholine. In the iron-promoted (Fenton-driven) model, procyanidines had a remarkable, dose-dependent antilipoperoxidant activity (IC50 = 2.5 mumol/l), more than one order of magnitude greater than that of the monomeric unit catechin (IC50 = 50 mumol/l), activity which is due, at least in part, to their metal-chelating properties. In the more specific model b), which discriminates between the initiator (hydroxyl radical from water sonolysis) and the propagator species of lipid peroxidation (the peroxyl radical, from autooxidation of C-centered radicals), procyanidines are highly effective in preventing conjugated diene formation in both the induction (IC50 = 0.1 mumol/l) and propagation (IC50 = 0.05 mumol/l) phases (the scavenging effect of alpha-tocopherol was weaker, with IC50 of 1.5 and 1.25 mumol/l). In addition, procyanidines at 0.5 mumol/l markedly delayed the onset of the breakdown phase (48 h), totally inhibiting during this time the formation of degradation products (the lag-time induced by alpha-tocopherol was only of 24 h at 10 mumol/l concentration). The HO degrees entrapping capacity of these compounds was further confirmed by UV studies and by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, using DMPO as spin trapper: procyanidines markedly reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the signal intensity of the DMPO-OH radical spin adduct (100% inhibition at 40 mumol/l). The results of the second part of this study show that procyanidines, in addition to free radical scavenging action, strongly and non-competitively, inhibit xanthine oxidase activity, the enzyme which triggers the oxy radical cascade (IC50 = 2.4 mumol/l). In addition procyanidines non-competitively inhibit the activities of the proteolytic enzymes collagenase (IC50 = 38 mumol/l) and elastase (IC50 = 4.24 mumol/l) and of the glycosidases hyaluronidase and beta-glucuronidase (IC50 = 80 mumol/l and 1.1 mumol/l), involved in the turnover of the main structural components of the extravascular matrix collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2015,25824219,Berberine blocks the relapse of Clostridium difficile infection in C57BL/6 mice after standard vancomycin treatment.,"Vancomycin is a preferred antibiotic for treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and has been associated with a rate of recurrence of CDI of as high as 20% in treated patients. Recent studies have suggested that berberine, an alternative medical therapy for gastroenteritis and diarrhea, exhibits several beneficial effects, including induction of anti-inflammatory responses and restoration of the intestinal barrier function. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of berberine on preventing CDI relapse and restoring the gut microbiota in a mouse model. Berberine was administered through gavage to C57BL/6 mice with established CDI-induced intestinal injury and colitis. The disease activity index (DAI), mean relative weight, histopathology scores, and levels of toxins A and B in fecal samples were measured. An Illumina sequencing-based analysis of 16S rRNA genes was used to determine the overall structural change in the microbiota in the mouse ileocecum. Berberine administration significantly promoted the restoration of the intestinal microbiota by inhibiting the expansion of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and counteracting the side effects of vancomycin treatment. Therapy consisting of vancomycin and berberine combined prevented weight loss, improved the DAI and the histopathology scores, and effectively decreased the mortality rate. Berberine prevented CDIs from relapsing and significantly improved survival in the mouse model of CDI. Our data indicate that a combination of berberine and vancomycin is more effective than vancomycin alone for treating CDI. One of the possible mechanisms by which berberine prevents a CDI relapse is through modulation of the gut microbiota. Although this conclusion was generated in the case of the mouse model, use of the combination of vancomycin and berberine and represent a novel therapeutic approach targeting CDI."
2003,14599556,Isodiospyrin as a novel human DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor.,"Isodiospyrin is a natural product from the plant Diospyros morrisiana, which consists of an asymmetrical 1,2-binaphthoquinone chromophore. Isodiospyrin exhibits cytotoxic activity to tumor cell lines but very little is known about its cellular target and mechanism of action. Unlike the prototypic human topoisomerase I (htopo I) poison camptothecin, isodiospyrin does not induce htopo I-DNA covalent complexes. However, isodiospyrin antagonizes camptothecin-induced, htopo I-mediated DNA cleavage. Binding analysis indicated that isodiospyrin binds htopo I but not DNA. These results suggest that isodiospyrin inhibits htopo I by direct binding to htopo I, which limits htopo I access to the DNA substrate. Furthermore, isodiospyrin exhibits strong inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of htopo I toward splicing factor 2/alternate splicing factor in the absence of DNA. Thus, these findings have important implications on naphthoquinone and its derivatives' cellular mode of actions, i.e. these novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors can prevent both DNA relaxation and kinase activities of htopo I."
2010,20363216,"Insulinotropic effect of cinnamaldehyde on transcriptional regulation of pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and GLUT4 translocation in experimental diabetic rats.","Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting about 6% of population worldwide with its complications and is rapidly reaching epidemic scale. Cinnamomum zeylanicum is widely used in alternative system of medicine for treatment of diabetes. In the present study, we have performed bioassay guided fractionation of chloroform extract of C. zeylaniucm and identified cinnamaldehyde (CND) as an active principle against diabetes. In continuation to it, a detailed study was undertaken to elucidate its mode of antidiabetic action in STZ induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of CND (20 mg/kg bw) to diabetic rats for 2 months showed significant improvement (p<0.001) in muscle and hepatic glycogen content. In vitro incubation of pancreatic islets with CND enhanced the insulin release compared to glibenclamide. The insulinotropic effect of CND was found to increase the glucose uptake through glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation in peripheral tissues. The treatment also showed a significant improvement in altered enzyme activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and their mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, the median lethal dose (LD(50)) of CND could not be obtained even at 20 times (0.4 g/kg bw) of its effective dose. With the high margin of safety of CND, it can be developed as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetes."
1997,9250116,"Effects of supplemental beta-carotene, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption on serum carotenoids in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study.","We determined whether serum carotenoid or retinol concentrations were altered by beta-carotene supplementation in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study and whether such effects were modified by alcohol consumption or cigarette use. Participants in this substudy were 491 randomly selected men aged 58-76 y from the metropolitan Helsinki study center [237 receiving supplemental beta-carotene (20 mg/d) and 254 not receiving such supplementation]. Dietary carotenoids, retinol, and alcohol, and serum beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, and cholesterol were assessed at baseline. After an average of 6.7 y of supplementation, serum was collected and carotenoid, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were determined by HPLC. Serum carotenoid fractions were highly correlated with each other (P < or = 0.0001). Compared with the unsupplemented group, the beta-carotene group had significantly higher serum concentrations of beta-carotene (1483%), alpha-carotene (145%), and beta-cryptoxanthin (67%) (P < or = 0.0001). Retinol concentrations were 6% higher (P = 0.03) and lutein was 11% lower (P = 0.02) in the supplemented group. Serum lycopene, zeaxanthin, and alpha-tocopherol did not differ according to beta-carotene-supplementation status. Although these beta-carotene-group differences were not significantly altered by amount of alcohol consumption, higher consumption (> 12.9 g/d, median) was related to lower (10-38%) concentrations of carotenoids, particularly beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, in both the supplemented and unsupplemented groups. Smoking status did not significantly influence the supplementation-related differences in serum carotenoid and retinol values but concentrations of carotenoids were generally highest in participants who quit smoking while in the study and lowest in current smokers of > or = 20 cigarettes/d. This study showed that serum concentrations of non-beta-carotene carotenoids are altered by long-term beta-carotene supplementation and confirms the adverse effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking on serum carotenoids."
2011,21897039,Functional compounds in fermented buckwheat sprouts.,"Fermented buckwheat sprouts (FBS) are used as multifunctional foods. Their production process includes fermentation with lactic acid bacteria. The major strains were found to include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Pediococcus pentosaceus in an investigation of the lactic acid bacteria. We searched for the functional components, and nicotianamine (NA) and 2″-hydroxynicotianamine (HNA) were identified as angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. NA and HNA increased during fermentation. Indole-3-ethanol was identified as an antioxidant (a SOD active substance), and may have been generated from tryptophan during fermentation because it was not contained in green buckwheat juice. A safety test demonstrated that FBS contained were safe functional food components, showing negative results in buckwheat allergy tests. Any buckwheat allergy substances might have been degraded during the fermentation process."
2015,26041312,Honey feeding protects kidney against cisplatin nephrotoxicity through suppression of inflammation.,"Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic drug used to treat a wide variety of solid tumors. However, its use was limited due its dose-limiting toxicity to the kidney. Currently, there are no therapies available to treat or prevent cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Honey is a naturally occurring complex liquid and widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat many illnesses. However, its effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity is unknown. To determine the role of honey in cisplatin nephrotoxicity, animals were pretreated orally for a week and then cisplatin was administered. Honey feeding was continued for another 3 days. Our results show that animals with cisplatin-induced kidney dysfunction, as determined by increased serum creatinine, which received honey feeding had less kidney dysfunction. Improved kidney function was associated with better preservation of kidney morphology in honey-treated group as compared to the cisplatin alone-treated group. Interestingly, honey feeding significantly reduced cisplatin-induced tubular epithelial cell death, immune infiltration into the kidney as well as cytokine and chemokine expression and excretion as compared to cisplatin treated animals. Western blot analysis shows that cisplatin-induced increase in phosphorylation of NFkB was completely suppressed with honey feeding. In conclusion, honey feeding protects the kidney against cisplatin nephrotoxicity through suppression of inflammation and NFkB activation."
2016,27016191,Modulatory effects of resveratrol on endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis and oxido-inflammatory markers in a rat model of rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease.,"The mechanisms leading to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not fully elucidated; however, mounting evidence implicates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative damage, and inflammatory changes are the crucial factors in its pathogenesis. This study was undertaken to investigate the modulatory effects of resveratrol on ER stress-mediated apoptosis, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in a rat model of rotenone-induced PD. mRNA expression levels of ER stress markers; C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), were estimated in the rat brain using quantitative real-time PCR. Caspase-3 activity, IL-1β levels and Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) DNA-binding activity were estimated by ELISA, while glutathione peroxidase and Xanthine oxidase activities, as well as protein carbonyl contents in the rat brain were evaluated spectrophotometrically. Our data revealed that Resveratrol ameliorated rotenone-induced ER stress by downregulating CHOP and GRP78 genes expression and hampered caspase-3 activity in the brain of rotenone exposed rats. It also restored redox balance as evident by suppressing Xanthine oxidase activity and protein carbonyls formation; in addition to preservation of intracellular antioxidants status via activating glutathione peroxidase and Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion; our study launched promising avenues for the potential use of resveratrol as a neuroprotective therapeutic agent in Parkinson's disease. "
2016,26784885,Panax notoginseng saponins ameliorate impaired arterial vasodilation in SHRSP.Z-Lepr(fa) /lzmDmcr rats with metabolic syndrome.,"Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are major components of Panax notoginseng, a herb with established clinical efficacy against vascular diseases. SHRSP.Z-Lepr(fa) /IzmDmcr (SHRSP.ZF) rats, a new animal model for metabolic syndrome, display an impaired vasorelaxation response in aortas and mesenteric arteries that is mediated by nitric oxide (NO). This study investigated whether PNS and its components can ameliorate this vascular dysfunction in SHRSP.ZF rats. In an in vitro study, in the presence or absence of PNS and its components, vasodilation in response to nitroprusside was determined from myographs under isometric tension conditions in aortas and mesenteric arteries from male SHRSP.ZF rats at 18-20 weeks of age. In an in vivo study, PNS (30 mg/kg per day) was orally administered to SHRSP.ZF rats from 8 to 20 weeks of age. In vitro treatment with PNS and Ginsenoside Rb1 increased nitroprusside-induced relaxation of aortas and mesenteric arteries in SHRSP.ZF rats. The PNS-induced increase was not affected by a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor or endothelium denudation. Relaxation in response to a cell-permeable cGMP analogue was increased by PNS, but cGMP accumulation by nitroprusside was not altered. In vivo treatment with PNS in SHRSP.ZF rats lowered blood pressure and increased relaxation and the expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase protein in arteries, without affecting metabolic abnormalities. These results indicate that PNS causes an increase in vasodilation in response to NO and a decrease in blood pressure, resulting in protection against vascular dysfunction in SHRSP.ZF rats. PNS might be beneficial in alleviating impaired vasodilation in metabolic syndrome."
2008,18277612,trans-Resveratrol relaxes the corpus cavernosum ex vivo and enhances testosterone levels and sperm quality in vivo.,"We examined the effects of trans-resveratrol on male reproductive functions; ex-vivo penile erection and in-vivo sperm counts and quality. For the ex-vivo study, the relaxation effects of resveratrol on isolated New Zealand white rabbit corpus cavernosum, precontracted by phenylephrine (5x10(-5) M) were measured. The in-vivo study measured reproductive organ weights, blood testosterone levels, testicular histopathology, sperm counts, as well as the epididymal sperm motility and deformity of male ICR mice given an oral dose of resveratrol (50 mg/ kg) for 28 days. Resveratrol elicited a concentration-dependent relaxing effect on corpus cavernosum, leading to a median effective concentration (EC50) of 0.29 mg/mL. Repeated treatment with resveratrol (50 mg/kg) did not cause an increase in body weight, reproductive organ weight or testicular microscopic findings; however, resveratrol did elicit an increase in blood testosterone concentration, testicular sperm counts and epididymal sperm motility by 51.6%, 15.8% and 23.3%, respectively, without influence on sperm deformity. In conclusion, we propose that resveratrol has a positive effect on male reproductive function by triggering a penile erection, as well as enhancing blood testosterone levels, testicular sperm counts, and epididymal sperm motility."
2003,12791626,Low vitamin B-12 concentrations in patients without anemia: the effect of folic acid fortification of grain.,"In some patients with vitamin B-12 deficiency mistakenly treated with folic acid, anemia resolved but neurologic complications became worse (masking). Fortification of enriched cereal grains with folic acid has raised concerns that people who consume large quantities of cereal grains, particularly the elderly, may be at increased risk of masking. It is unclear, however, what proportion of people with low vitamin B-12 concentrations do not have anemia and whether the proportion is increasing.We investigated whether fortification has increased the proportion of patients with low vitamin B-12 but without anemia.We reviewed the laboratory results of every patient for whom a vitamin B-12 concentration was measured at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, DC, between 1992 and 2000. Those with a low vitamin B-12 concentration (< 258 pmol/L) had their hematocrits and mean cell volumes checked. The proportion without anemia was examined by year before, during, and after folic acid fortification began.There were 1573 subjects with a low vitamin B-12 concentration. The proportion without anemia did not increase significantly from the prefortification period (39.2%) to the period of optional fortification (45.5%) and the postfortification period (37.6%). These findings did not change when the analysis was limited to patients aged > 60 y or when a more conservative definition of low vitamin B-12 (< 150 pmol/L) was used.Despite evidence that folic acid exposure has increased dramatically since food fortification began, this population showed no evidence of an increase in low vitamin B-12 concentrations without anemia. If confirmed, these results would indicate that food fortification has not caused a major increase in masking of vitamin B-12 deficiency."
2012,22960033,"What is a food and what is a medicinal product in the European Union? Use of the benchmark dose (BMD) methodology to define a threshold for ""pharmacological action"".","The decision criterion for the demarcation between foods and medicinal products in the EU is the significant ""pharmacological action"". Based on six examples of substances with ambivalent status, the benchmark dose (BMD) method is evaluated to provide a threshold for pharmacological action. Using significant dose-response models from literature clinical trial data or epidemiology, the BMD values were 63mg/day for caffeine, 5g/day for alcohol, 6mg/day for lovastatin, 769mg/day for glucosamine sulfate, 151mg/day for Ginkgo biloba extract, and 0.4mg/day for melatonin. The examples for caffeine and alcohol validate the approach because intake above BMD clearly exhibits pharmacological action. Nevertheless, due to uncertainties in dose-response modelling as well as the need for additional uncertainty factors to consider differences in sensitivity within the human population, a ""borderline range"" on the dose-response curve remains. ""Pharmacological action"" has proven to be not very well suited as binary decision criterion between foods and medicinal product. The European legislator should rethink the definition of medicinal products, as the current situation based on complicated case-by-case decisions on pharmacological action leads to an unregulated market flooded with potentially illegal food supplements."
1997,8980260,Improved method for diagnosis of polycythemia vera based on flow cytometric analysis of autonomous growth of erythroid precursors in liquid culture.,"""Autonomous"" development of erythroid colonies in erythropoietin (EPO)-free semi-solid culture has been used as an in vitro assay for diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV). These colonies, however, are small and poorly hemoglobinized, rendering the assay in many cases unreliable. We report here on the use of a novel assay; it combines a modified culture procedure that maximizes the growth of EPO-independent erythroid cells, and immunofluorescence flow cytometry for their detection and quantitation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured for 2-5 days in the presence of a combination of growth factors. During this phase, early erythroid committed progenitors, burst forming units (BFUe), proliferate and differentiate into colony forming units (CFUe)-like progenitors. In the second phase, the latter cells, in the presence of stem cell factor, hemin, and iron-saturated transferrin, continue to proliferate and mature into hemoglobin (Hb)-containing orthochromatic normoblasts. Neither phases contained EPO. The culture produced large, pure, and synchronized erythroid cell populations. The cells were then dually labeled with fluorescent probes, nuclear DNA with thiazole orange and intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against human Hb. Cells positive for both labels were assigned as Hb-containing nucleated precursors. The presence of such cells in EPO-free cultures indicated ""autonomous growth."" None of the EPO-free cultures derived from normal donors or patients with secondary polycythemia contained such cells. Cultures derived from PV patients contained from 5 to 92% ""autonomously grown"" cells. These culture and analysis methods should minimize false negative results with PV patients and provide objective and quantitative data."
,6689468,Wheat germ agglutinin binding to cells derived from in vivo grown solid tumors.,"Binding of Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) to cell suspensions derived from in vivo grown solid rat tumors of independent origin and of different metastatic potential has been examined, and results compared with previous work in other systems. The assay used to assess binding was based on the reaction of iodine 125-labelled lectin to tumor cells in suspension and values expressed as per cent of values of a cell line used as internal standard. Inhibition studies showed that WGA binding was principally to sialic acid and/or N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Binding parameters Bmax (maximal binding) and Kd (affinity of binding), derived from Woolf plots and expressed as per cent of internal standard cell line, were found for rat tumors Mc7, Mc40A, Sp24 and Walker 256. It was observed that cell suspensions derived from the metastatic and most tumorigenic tumor, Walker 256, exhibited a different pattern of lectin binding to the other non-metastatic and less tumorigenic tumors; in particular, Kd values were lower. These results are in accord with work using cell lines selected in vitro and are further evidence for a correlation between the density and/or configuration of cell surface sialic acid residues and metastatic potential."
2013,23122070,Syzygium aqueum leaf extract and its bioactive compounds enhances pre-adipocyte differentiation and 2-NBDG uptake in 3T3-L1 cells.,"The insulin-like and/or insulin-sensitising effects of Syzygium aqueum leaf extract and its six bioactive compounds; 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, europetin-3-O-rhamnoside, phloretin, myrigalone-G and myrigalone-B were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We observed that, S. aqueum leaf extract (0.04-5 μg/ml) and its six bioactive compounds (0.08-10 μM) at non-cytotoxic concentrations were effectively enhance adipogenesis, stimulate glucose uptake and increase adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Clearly, the compounds myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside and europetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed insulin-like and insulin-sensitising effects on adipocytes from a concentration of 0.08 μM. These compounds were far better than rosiglitazone and the other isolated compounds in enhancing adipogenesis, stimulating 2-NBDG uptake and increasing adiponectin secretion at all the concentrations tested. These suggest the antidiabetic potential of S. aqueum leaf extract and its six bioactive compounds. However, further molecular interaction studies to explain the mechanisms of action are highly warranted."
2007,17768392,Targeted treatments to improve stem cell outcome: old and new drugs.,"Thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib have been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the recent years. These agents are now being increasingly integrated into therapeutic regimens for newly diagnosed patients. First data are available on the promising activity of these novel agents in induction therapy, as well as maintenance treatment to improve outcome after stem cell transplantation. Whether these early results will lead to prolonged overall survival and thereby ultimately redefine the role of stem cell transplantation in first-line treatment of multiple myeloma will be one of the most important questions to be answered in the coming years.

2005,16139249,6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase expression through the inhibition of Janus kinase 2-mediated JNK pathway in lipopolysaccharide-activated murine macrophages.,"6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC) is an active ingredient of Wasabi (Wasabia japonica (Miq.) Matsumura), which is a very popular pungent spice in Japan. To clarify the cellular signaling mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory action of 6-MITC, we investigated the effects of 6-MITC on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW264 cells. 6-MITC showed a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO), iNOS mRNA and protein. LPS caused the c-Jun phosphorylation (a major component of AP-1) and IkappaB-alpha degradation. 6-MITC suppressed LPS-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not inhibit IkappaB-alpha degradation. Cellular signaling analysis using MAPK-(U0126 for MEK1/2, SB203580 for p38 kinase and SP600125 for JNK) and Jak2-specific (AG490) inhibitors demonstrated that LPS stimulated iNOS expression via activating Jak2-mediated JNK, but not ERK and p38, pathway. 6-MITC suppressed iNOS expression through the inhibition of Jak2-mediated JNK signaling cascade with the attendant to AP-1 activation. In addition, the structure-activity study revealed that the inhibitory potency of methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates (MITCs) depended on the methyl chain length. These findings provide the molecular basis for the first time that 6-MITC is an effective agent to attenuate iNOS production."
2006,16242869,External and internal exposure of wine growers spraying methyl parathion.,"Organophosphates, used in agriculture, are readily absorbed through the skin. We investigated the relationship between dermal and inhalative methyl parathion exposure and the plasma levels. Twenty-three healthy wine growers sprayed the insecticide for 50 min. Fluorescent brilliant sulfoflavin was added to the spraying fluids and filter papers were fixed on the subjects. The filter papers were used to evaluate the amount of brilliant sulfoflavine on the unprotected skin fluorometrically. Inhalative exposure was measured with personal air sampler. Plasma concentrations of methyl parathion and its metabolite methyl paraoxon were determined with gas chromatography. Cholinesterase activity in serum and erythrocytes was measured before and after exposure. Some wine growers wore protective clothes, none protective gloves. Dermal exposure ranged up to 12,044 microg, inhalative to 22 microg. Maximum plasma concentration of methyl parathion was 12.1 microg/l. Methyl paraoxon was not detectable. Cholinesterase activity did not decrease. Dermal exposure correlated with the methyl parathion plasma level (Spearman's rho=0.72, p<0.001). In conclusion, dermal exposure exceeded inhalative exposure considerably. Measuring dermal deposition with the brilliant sulfoflavin technique may provide a good estimate of the internal load with methyl parathion. Preventive measures should be improved as toxic effects of repeated exposure to low doses of methyl parathion cannot be excluded."
2017,28567440,"Brazilian Morus nigra Attenuated Hyperglycemia, Dyslipidemia, and Prooxidant Status in Alloxan-Induced Diabetic Rats.","Morus nigra has been used popularly for several proposes, including diabetic. In an attempt to support medicinal value, the acute hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and antioxidant effects of the ethanolic extract of Morus nigra (EEMn 200 or 400 mg/kg b.w.) were evaluated in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic treated for 14 days. Serum biochemical and antioxidant analysis were performed at the end of experiment. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed at 10th and 15th days. Chromatographic analysis by HPLC-DAD of EEMn was performed. Insulin was used as positive control to glycemic metabolism as well as fenofibrate to lipid metabolism. EEMn (400 mg/kg/day) reduced fasting and postprandial glycaemia, improved oral glucose tolerance, and reduced lipolysis and proteolysis in diabetic rats. EEMn decreased the blood levels of total cholesterol and increased HDL level when compared to the diabetic control rats. At higher levels, EEMn reduced triglycerides and VLDL levels in diabetic rats. Also, EEMn reduced malondialdehyde and increased the reduced glutathione levels in liver of diabetic rats. Chromatographic analysis identified the presence of the flavonoids rutin, isoquercetin, and kaempferitrin. Acute EEMn treatment reduced hyperglycemia, improved oral glucose tolerance, and minimized dyslipidemia and oxidative stress leading to a reduction in atherogenic index in alloxan-induced diabetic rats."
2014,25743587,[Examination of processed vegetable foods for the presence of common DNA sequences of genetically modified tomatoes].,"The contamination of processed vegetable foods with genetically modified tomatoes was investigated by the use of qualitative PCR methods to detect the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (P35S) and the kanamycin resistance gene (NPTII). DNA fragments of P35S and NPTII were detected in vegetable juice samples, possibly due to contamination with the genomes of cauliflower mosaic virus infecting juice ingredients of Brassica species and soil bacteria, respectively. Therefore, to detect the transformation construct sequences of GM tomatoes, primer pairs were designed for qualitative PCR to specifically detect the border region between P35S and NPTII, and the border region between nopaline synthase gene promoter and NPTII. No amplification of the targeted sequences was observed using genomic DNA purified from the juice ingredients. The developed qualitative PCR method is considered to be a reliable tool to check contamination of products with GM tomatoes. "
2018,28873551,Are tropane alkaloids present in organic foods? Detection of scopolamine and atropine in organic buckwheat (Fagopyron esculentum L.) products by UHPLC-MS/MS.,"A closer monitoring of tropane alkaloids (TA) in foods is now recommended by the European Commission, following a series of alerts related to the contamination of buckwheat with weeds of the genus Datura. A novel, accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the rapid detection of scopolamine and atropine in buckwheat foods. A suitable extraction protocol was set up to maximize recoveries and detection limits in different raw, processed and baked foods. The method offers good performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and precision, with LOQs at 0.04 and 0.10µg/kg. The established method is suitable for routine determination of trace levels of TA and was applied to 26 different buckwheat-derived organic foods, detecting TA in 3 samples (13.9-83.9µg/kg for atropine and 5.7-10.4µg/kg for scopolamine). Only in one case the level of contamination was relevant in terms of food safety."
2013,23265508,Influence of flour blend composition on fermentation kinetics and phytate hydrolysis of sourdough used to make injera.,"The influence of cereal blends, teff-white sorghum (TwS), barley-wheat (BW) and wheat-red sorghum (WrS), on fermentation kinetics during traditional fermentation of dough to prepare injera, an Ethiopian traditional fermented pancake, was investigated in samples collected in households. Barley malt was used with BW and WrS flours. WrS- and BW-injera sourdough fermentations were characterised by a transient accumulation of glucose and maltose and a two-step fermentation process: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation with ethanol as the main end product. Only transient accumulation of glucose was observed in TwS-injera, and equimolar concentrations of lactic acid and ethanol were produced simultaneously. Final α-galactoside concentrations were low in all sourdoughs. Phytic acid (IP6) was completely hydrolyzed in WrS and BW-injeras probably due to the combined action of endogenous malt and microbial phytases. Only 28% IP6 hydrolysis was observed in TwS injera. Ways to improve IP6 hydrolysis in TwS-injera need to be investigated."
2011,21679698,Anticancer activity of thymoquinone in breast cancer cells: possible involvement of PPAR-γ pathway.,"Thymoquinone (TQ), an active ingredient of Nigella sativa, has been reported to exhibit anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities through mechanism(s) that is not fully understood. In this study, we report the anticancer effects of TQ on breast cancer cells, and its potential effect on the PPAR-γ activation pathway. We found that TQ exerted strong anti-proliferative effect in breast cancer cells and, when combined with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, increased cytotoxicity. TQ was found to increase sub-G1 accumulation and annexin-V positive staining, indicating apoptotic induction. In addition, TQ activated caspases 8, 9 and 7 in a dose-dependent manner. Migration and invasive properties of MDA-MB-231 cells were also reduced in the presence of TQ. Interestingly, we report for the first time that TQ was able to increase PPAR-γ activity and down-regulate the expression of the genes for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin in breast cancer cells. More importantly, the increase in PPAR-γ activity was prevented in the presence of PPAR-γ specific inhibitor and PPAR-γ dominant negative plasmid, suggesting that TQ may act as a ligand of PPAR-γ. Also, we observed using molecular docking analysis that TQ indeed formed interactions with 7 polar residues and 6 non-polar residues within the ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-γ that are reported to be critical for its activity. Taken together, our novel observations suggest that TQ may have potential implication in breast cancer prevention and treatment, and show for the first time that the anti-tumor effect of TQ may also be mediated through modulation of the PPAR-γ activation pathway."
2015,25466095,Influence of deficit irrigation strategies on fatty acid and tocopherol concentration of almond (Prunus dulcis).,"The effects of deficit irrigation on almond fatty acid and tocopherol levels were studied in a field trial. Mature almond trees were subjected to three levels of deficit irrigation (85%, 70% and 55% of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETo), as well as control (100% ETo) and over-irrigation (120% ETo) treatments. Two deficit irrigation strategies were employed: regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and sustained deficit irrigation (SDI). Moderate deficit irrigation (85% RDI and 85% SDI) had no detrimental impact on almond kernel lipid content, but severe and extreme deficiencies (70% and 55%) influenced lipid content. Unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents fluctuated under these treatments, the oleic/linoleic ratio increased under moderate water deficiency, but decreased under severe and extreme water deficiency. Almond tocopherols concentration was relatively stable under deficit irrigation. The variation between years indicated climate has an effect on almond fruit development. In conclusion it is feasible to irrigate almond trees using less water than the normal requirement, without significant loss of kernel quality. "
2019,29704206,Protective Effect of Rosa damascena Against Aluminum Chloride-Induced Oxidative Stress.,"Aluminum is considered an essential element endowed with toxicity potentials in human and animal. Thus, intoxication with aluminum can lead to oxidative stress, which is associated with oxidative damage to various macromolecules. Moreover, antioxidants from natural sources can play an important role in human health. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Rosa damascena extract against aluminum-induced oxidative stress. In this study, 60 male rats were randomly divided into six groups and then they were given daily aluminum chloride and Rosa damascena extract. After 8 weeks of treatment, the levels of total antioxidant and malondialdehyde, as well as antioxidant enzymes including catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and myeloperoxidase, were measured in all experimental groups in this study. A significant increase was found in the total antioxidant level in the rats treated with aluminum, Rosa damascena extract, and aluminum plus Rosa damascena extract compared with those in the control group. Also, malondialdehyde levels were not significantly different in all the studied groups. Glutathione S-transferase activity levels in rats receiving the Rosa damascena extract as well as rats taking aluminum with Rosa damascena extract increased significantly compared with the ones in the control group. Catalase activity in the aluminum-treated group also increased significantly compared with the rates in the control group (31.34 ± 4.50 U/gHb vs. 14.04 ± 6.17 U/gHb, p = 0.014). Furthermore, myeloperoxidase activity in the aluminum-treated group increased significantly compared with the control group (49.47 ± 5.12 U/L vs. 25.28 ± 2.18 U/L, p < 0.001). The Rosa damascena extract could improve antioxidant capacity and reduce oxidative conditions in rats receiving aluminum chloride as evidenced by assays of the ferric reducing ability of plasma and activity of antioxidant enzymes. According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the Rosa damascena extract with its high antioxidant content is able to exert a protective effect against aluminum-induced oxidative stress."
2008,18379076,20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and activates AMPK.,"Although Panax ginseng has been widely used in oriental countries for pharmacological effects such as anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic and anti-fatigue activities, the active ingredient is not yet fully identified. In our preliminary studies, protopanaxadiol ginsenosides showed the insulin secretion-stimulating activity. In HIT-T15 cells, Rg3 enhanced the insulin secretion in a concentration dependent manner. This effect, however, was almost completely abolished in the presence of diazoxide (K+ channel opener) or nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also performed using ICR mice and Rg3 suppressed the blood glucose levels from rising by enhancing an insulin secretion at 30 min after administration. From these studies, we may conclude that Rg3 lowered the plasma glucose level by stimulating an insulin secretion and this action was presumably associated with ATP sensitive K+ channel. Next, to explore the hypothesis that ginsenoside Rg3 epimers may exhibit differential effects, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion activity and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were compared between 20(S)- and 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3. 5 microM of 20(S)-Rg3 enhanced the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 58% compared to the control, but 20(R)-Rg3 did not show any effect. In C2C12 myotubes, 20(S)- and 20(R)-Rg3 both markedly phosphorylated AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), although 20(R)-Rg3 showed a little less effect. Taken together, our results suggest that ginsenoside Rg3 epimers showed differential activities, and 20(S)-Rg3 epimer exhibited the higher pharmacological effects in insulin secretion and AMPK activation than 20(R)-Rg3. The novel characteristics of 20(S)-Rg3 may be a valuable candidate for anti-diabetic agent."
2018,29864942,Spasmolytic effect of aqueous extract of Tagetes erecta L. flowers is mediated through calcium channel blockade on the guinea-pig ileum.,"This study provides pharmacological evidence on the spasmolytic activity of Tagetes erecta L. (marigold or cempasúchil) on the guinea-pig ileum and presents data on its mechanism of action. The relaxant effect on KCl contractions was more marked with aqueous (AqEx) than with ethanol extracts (EtEx) of T. erecta flowers (55.6 ± 11.0 vs 21.1 ± 4.4%, respectively). In addition, the aqueous extract antagonized contractions elicited by EFS, but not by acetylcholine (73.5 ± 1.9 vs 14.5 ± 5.3%, respectively). These effects were not diminished by hexamethonium or L-NAME, but this extract caused a rightward shift in the Ca2+ concentration-response curves like that of verapamil. Quercetin and rutin, two flavonoids present in this plant, also showed spasmolytic effects (95.7 ± 2.8 and 27.9 ± 7.1%, respectively). Interestingly, in tissues without spasmogens, the extract induced contractions superimposed on their spontaneous activity. These results support the traditional use of T. erecta as a spasmolytic in folk medicine and suggest mainly that quercetin could be partly responsible for this effect. The spasmolytic effect appears to involve voltage-gated calcium channels, but not the nitric oxide pathway or the release of neurotransmitters from enteric neurons. Nevertheless, this plant could produce colic or stomachache as adverse effects in clinical situations in which these symptoms are not originally present."
2019,30832648,Effects of resveratrol on Th17 cell-related immune responses under tacrolimus-based immunosuppression.,"We previously reported that tacrolimus (Tac) does not decrease T helper 17 cells (Th17) response in kidney transplantation. In this study, we evaluated whether Resveratrol (Resv) has immunosuppressive effects by decreasing Th17 responses in Tac-based immunosuppression.We investigated the effects of Resv under Tac-treatment conditions, on CD4+ T cell differentiation to Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and proliferation of CD4+ T cells co-cultured with human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEpiCs). The effects of Resv on Th17 cells were tested in the murine skin transplant model.In PBMCs, Tac did not but combination of Tac and Resv further suppressed Th17 immune response. In the co-culture study, combination of Resv to Tac significantly decreased HRPTEpiC-induced T cell proliferation compared to Tac alone. Resv treatment in the Jurkat cell induced the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase and suppressed the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suggesting blocking Th17 pathway by Resv. In the murine skin transplant model, combination of Resv to Tac significantly prolonged skin graft survival accompanied by the suppression of Th17 cells, compared to either the Tac-alone or control groups.The results of our study suggest that Resv provides additional immunosuppressive effects to Tac by suppressing effector CD4+ T cells, especially Th17 cells, in the transplantation setting."
2018,30372872,Green tea extract modulates oxidative tissue injury in beta-thalassemic mice by chelation of redox iron and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.,"Iron overload in patients with β-thalassemia can cause oxidative organ dysfunction. Iron chelation along with antioxidant supplementation can ameliorate such complications and prolong lives. Green tea extract (GTE) rich in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) exhibits anti-oxidation and iron chelation properties in β-knockout thalassemic (BKO) mice diagnosed with iron overload. We investigated the effects of GTE and deferiprone (DFP) alone in combination with one another, and upon the levels of redox-active iron, lipid-peroxidation product, insulin and hepcidin in BKO mice. A state of iron overload was induced in the mice via a trimethylhexanoyl-ferrocene supplemented (Fe) diet for 3 months, and the mice were treated daily with either: DFP (50 mg/kg), DFP (50 mg/kg) plus GTE (50 mg EGCG equivalent/kg), or GTE alone for 2 months. Plasma non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepcidin and insulin; tissue iron and MDA were measured. DFP, GTE and GTE + DFP effectively decreased plasma MDA (p < 0.05), NTBI and ALT, and increased plasma hepcidin and insulin. All the treatments also reduced iron accumulation and MDA production in both the pancreas and liver in the mice. However, the combination therapy demonstrated no advantages over monotherapy. The findings suggest GTE improved liver and pancreatic β-cell functions in iron-overloaded β-thalassemia mice by diminishing redox iron and free radicals, while inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Consequently, there are indications that GTE holds significant potential for clinical use."
2013,24453836,Optimization of green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from leaf extracts of Pimenta dioica (Allspice).,"Production of silver nanoparticles from the leaf extracts of Pimenta dioica is reported for the first time in this paper. Three different sets of leaves were utilized for the synthesis of nanoparticles-fresh, hot-air oven dried, and sun-dried. These nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy and AFM. The results were diverse in that different sizes were seen for different leaf conditions. Nanoparticles synthesized using sun-dried leaves (produced using a particular ratio (1 : 0.5) of the leaf extract sample and silver nitrate (1 mM), resp.) possessed the smallest sizes. We believe that further optimization of the current green-synthesis method would help in the production of monodispersed silver nanoparticles having great potential in treating several diseases."
2016,27132850,Involvement of energy metabolism to chilling tolerance induced by hydrogen sulfide in cold-stored banana fruit.,"In this study, the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on energy metabolism in postharvest banana fruit under chilling stress was investigated. Banana fruit, fumigated with optimal concentration (0.5mM) of aqueous sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) solution for 24h, were initially stored at 7°C for 14d and 20°C for another 6d. H2S treated banana fruit showed both higher value of firmness and Hue angle, as well as lower value of electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and ethylene production. These indicated slower development of chilling injury compared with the control. Decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and energy charge was not noticeable in H2S treated banana fruit. Moreover, the activity of H(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), associated with energy metabolism, were significantly enhanced by H2S treatment. Therefore, it can be deduced that H2S can potentially alleviate chilling development in banana fruit by increasing enzymes activities, involved in energy metabolism, to maintain energy charge. "
2015,25148981,"Botanical origin, colour, granulation, and sensory properties of the Harenna forest honey, Bale, Ethiopia.","In this study, the Harenna forest honey samples were investigated with respect to their botanical origin, granulation, colour and sensory properties. Sixteen honey samples were collected from two representative sites (Chiri, C, and Wabero, W) using random sampling techniques. Botanical origin was investigated using qualitative pollen analysis by counting 500 pollen grains using harmonised methods of melissopalynology. Granulation, colour, and sensory properties of honey were determined by visual observation, using Pfund grader, acceptability and preference tests, respectively. Honey samples were also tested for tetracycline. Honey obtained from Wabero is originated dominantly from Syzygium guineense while Chiri was multifloral. The colour of honey ranged from 34 to 85 with light amber and extra light amber colours. The honey samples were free from tetracycline residue and form coarse granules slowly. Significant variation (p>0.05) in sensory preference and acceptability tests not observed due to hive types and locations. "
2010,20538797,Long-term follow-up and factors influencing outcomes after related HLA-identical cord blood transplantation for patients with malignancies: an analysis on behalf of Eurocord-EBMT.,"We analyzed risk factors influencing outcomes after related (R) human leukocyte antigen-identical cord blood transplantation (CBT) for 147 patients with malignancies reported to Eurocord-European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. CBT has been performed since 1990; median follow-up was 6.7 years. Median patient age was 5 years. Acute leukemia was the most frequent diagnosis (74%). At CBT, 40 patients had early, 70 intermediate, and 37 advanced disease. CB grafts contained a median of 4.1 × 10(7)/kg total nucleated cells (TNCs) after thawing. The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery was 90% at day +60. CIs of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 12% and 10% at 2 years, respectively. At 5 years, CIs of nonrelapse mortality and relapse were 9% and 47%, respectively; the probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were 44% and 55%, respectively. Among other factors, higher TNCs infused was associated with rapid neutrophil recovery and improved DFS. The use of methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis decreased the CI of engraftment. Patients without advanced disease had improved DFS. These results support banking and use of CB units for RCBT. Cell dose, GVHD prophylaxis not including methotrexate, and disease status are important factors for outcomes after RCBT."
2017,28197528,Antimutagenic Effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Aqueous Extract on Rats Treated with Monosodium Glutamate.,"Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is a plant of the Malvaceae family, commonly known as roselle. H. sabdariffa is known to contain antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering, antiobesity, insulin resistance reduction, antihypertensive, and skin cancer chemopreventive properties. This study evaluated the effects of H. sabdariffa aqueous extract against cyclophosphamide (CPA, 25 mg/Kg) induced damage to DNA in male Wistar rats by micronucleus test. Samples of H. sabdariffa calyx were obtained in the municipality of Barra do Garças, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The aqueous extract was prepared by infusion and each animal received a daily dose of 400 mg/Kg by gavage for 15 consecutive days of treatment. The presence of anthocyanins was confirmed by ferric chloride test and phenolic compounds using high-performance liquid chromatography, with emphasis on the identification of rutin. The animals were sacrificed by deepening of anaesthesia to obtain bone marrow and determination of the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. The group treated with the aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa revealed a 91% reduction in micronucleus frequency when compared with the positive control group. Under the conditions tested, H. sabdariffa L. presented a protective effect to CPA-induced damage to DNA of the treated animals, and it is a potential candidate as a chemopreventive agent against carcinogenesis."
2014,25246773,Novel swellable polymer of orchidaceae family for gastroretentive drug delivery of famotidine.,"This study aimed to develop hydrophilic, gastroretentive matrix tablets of famotidine with good floating and swelling properties. A novel gastroretentive drug delivery formulation was designed using salep, also known as salepi, a flour obtained from grinding dried palmate tubers of Orchis morio var mascula (Orchidaceae family). The main polysaccharide content of salep is glucomannan, highly soluble in cold and hot water, which forms a viscous solution. Salep was characterized for physicochemical properties, thermal stability, chemical interaction, and surface morphology using X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Ten different formulations (S1-S10) were prepared using famotidine to salep ratios from 1:0.5 to 1:5. Results demonstrated that all formulations were able to sustain the drug release for more than 24 hours. The S5 formulation, with a famotidine to salep ratio of 1:2.5, had the shortest floating lag time of 35 seconds and 100% drug release within 24 hours. The dissolution data were fitted into popular mathematical models to assess the mechanism of drug release. S5 showed Zero order release (R=0.9746) with Higuchi diffusion (R=0.9428). We conclude that salep, a novel polymer, can be used in controlled release formulations to sustain release for 24 hours, due to inherent swelling and gelling properties. "
2016,27061741,The evaluation of 3 diets for rearing Hyalella azteca and the influence of diet on acute ammonia toxicity.,"Three Hyalella azteca cultures were reared on different diets since birth, reflecting the recommended diets of various investigators. The 3 diets consisted of fish flakes (FF), a mixture of fish flakes supplemented with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii (FF-D), and a mixture of fish flakes supplemented with yeast, cereal grass media, and trout chow (FF-YCT). The 3 diets were evaluated by comparing 20 wk of culturing data, along with the organism's response to standard 96-h toxicity testing with ammonium chloride over a range of pH and temperature. Hyalella azteca fed the FF-D diet had the highest overall survival rate (96.6%, standard deviation [SD] 4.3%) compared to those fed the FF diet (92.0%, SD 12.7%), or the FF-YCT diet (91.1%, SD 14.8%), although difference in survival was not statistically significant. Organisms fed the FF-D diet produced a higher number of young per week per adult (6.1, SD 2.8) than the FF diet (5.1, SD 2.2), or the FF-YCT diet (4.0, SD 1.2), although differences were not statistically significant. Of the diets evaluated, H. azteca reared on the FF-D diet were often significantly more resistant to total and un-ionized ammonia toxicity in acute 96-h testing than those reared on the other 2 diets across the 2 temperatures and 5 pHs tested, suggesting this may be the most optimal diet for this species.

2002,12230229,Iron status and dietary intake of Chinese pregnant women with anaemia in the third trimester.,"Anaemia in pregnancy is a major public health problem in China. Anaemia in pregnant women may be related to dietary intake of nutrients. To examine the relationship between iron status and dietary nutrients, a cross-sectional study in pregnant women was carried out. The intake of foods and food ingredients were surveyed by using 24-h dietary recall. Blood haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin and soluble transferrin receptor were measured in 1189 clinically normal pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The results showed that the average daily intake of rice and wheat was 504.2 g in the anaemia group and 468.6 g in the normal group. Carbohydrates accounted for 63.69% and 63.09% of energy in the anaemia and normal groups, respectively. Intake of fat was very low; 18.38% of energy in anaemia group and 19.23% of energy in normal group. Soybean intake was 109.4 g/day and 63.6 g/day in the anaemia and normal groups, respectively (P < 0.001). There were lower intakes of green vegetables (172.1 g/day) and fruits (154.9 g/day) in the anaemia group than in the normal group (246.2 g/day green vegetables (P < 0.001) and 196.4 g/day fruit (P < 0.001)). Intakes of retinol and ascorbic acid were much lower in the anaemia than in the normal group (P < 0.001). In the anaemia group, vitamin A intake was only 54.76% of the Chinese recommended daily allowance (RDA) and ascorbic acid intake was 53.35% of the Chinese RDA. Intake of total vitamin E was 14.55 mg/day in the anaemia group compared with 17.35 mg/day in the normal group (P < 0.016). Moreover, intake of iron in pregnant women with anaemia was slightly lower than that in the normal group. Comparison of iron status between the anaemia and normal groups found serum iron in women with anaemia at 0.89 microg/L, which was significantly lower than 1.09 microg/L in the normal group (P < 0.001). There were lower average values of ferritin (14.70) microg/L) and transferrin (3.34 g/L) in the anaemia group than in the normal group (20.40 microg/L ferritin (P < 0.001) and 3.44 g/L transferrin (P < 0.001)). Soluble transferrin receptor was significantly higher (32.90 nmol/L) in the anaemia than in the normal group (23.58 nmol/L; P < 0.001). The results of this study indicate that anaemia might be attributed to a low iron intake, a low intake of enhancers of iron absorption and a high intake of inhibitors of iron absorption from a traditional Chinese diet rich in grains."
1997,9359497,Survival of patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia relapsing after bone marrow transplantation: comparison with patients receiving conventional chemotherapy.,"Treatment with busulphan and/or hydroxyurea rarely produces remission in patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase. HLA-identical sibling transplants almost always produce remission, and only about 20% of patients relapse post-transplant. The increased anti-leukaemic efficacy of transplants results from intensive pretransplant treatment and immune-mediated anti-leukaemia effects. We studied 433 patients surviving > or = 2 years after diagnosis of CML to determine if patients who have relapsed after a transplant in chronic phase have longer survival from diagnosis than comparable subjects receiving chemotherapy. The chemotherapy cohort included 344 adults < 50 years of age treated on consecutive trials of the Italian Cooperative Study Group on CML between 1973 and 1986. The transplant cohort included 89 patients reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry who relapsed after an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant carried out between 1978 and 1992. Survivals in the two groups were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for prognostic variables. Median survival was 65 months in the chemotherapy cohort and 86 months in the transplant cohort. The 7-year probability (95% confidence interval) of survival was 34% (28-39%) in the chemotherapy cohort and 57% (43-70%) in the transplant cohort (P=0003). There was no difference in survival of patients relapsing after T-cell depleted and non-T-cell-depleted transplants. We conclude that patients who relapse after an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant for CML in chronic phase have longer survival from diagnosis than comparable patients receiving chemotherapy. This effect is most likely to be the result of intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation given for pretransplant conditioning."
2012,22802250,Effect of ginkgo biloba on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in healthy volunteers.,"Medicinal herbs may cause clinically relevant drug interactions with antiretroviral agents. Ginkgo biloba extract is a popular herbal product among HIV-infected patients because of its positive effects on cognitive function. Raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, is increasingly being used as part of combined antiretroviral therapy. Clinical data on the potential inhibitory or inductive effect of ginkgo biloba on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir were lacking, and concomitant use was not recommended. We studied the effect of ginkgo biloba extract on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover phase I trial in 18 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to a regimen of 120 mg of ginkgo biloba twice daily for 15 days plus a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) on day 15, a washout period, and 400 mg of raltegravir on day 36 or the test and reference treatments in reverse order. Pharmacokinetic sampling of raltegravir was performed up to 12 h after intake on an empty stomach. All subjects (9 male) completed the trial, and no serious adverse events were reported. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) and the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of raltegravir with ginkgo biloba versus raltegravir alone were 1.21 (0.93 to 1.58) and 1.44 (1.03 to 2.02). Ginkgo biloba did not reduce raltegravir exposure. The potential increase in the C(max) of raltegravir is probably of minor importance, given the large intersubject variability of raltegravir pharmacokinetics and its reported safety profile."
2016,27238153,Glycyrrhizic Acid Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment in a Rat Model of Vascular Dementia Associated with Oxidative Damage and Inhibition of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels.,"Vascular dementia (VD) is the second most common cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly population. Our study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major active constituent of Glycyrrhiza glabra root, in a VD rat model induced by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Spatial cognitive function was examined by the Morris water maze test and synaptic plasticity was explored by assessing long-term potentiation. The results showed that GA (20 mg/kg for 5 days) significantly improved the performance of learning and memory of VD rats in the Morris water maze test and attenuated induction of long-term potentiation. Histopathological studies showed that GA significantly attenuated cell damage in VD rats. Malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity were analyzed in the hippocampus and cortex to investigate anti-oxidant status. The results showed that GA decreased the level of lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase in VD rats. Lastly, whole-cell patch-clamp analysis was used to examine the effect of GA on voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. GA (10, 20 and 50 μM) inhibited the current amplitude of the VGSCs. These results suggest that the neuroprotective e.ects of GA in VD rats relate to the reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of VGSCs. Our study provides experimental evidence for the application of GA in the treatment of cognitive deficits induced by Alzheimer's disease, stroke, or traumatic brain injury."
2020,30208742,"Involvement of metallothionein, homocysteine and B-vitamins in the attenuation of arsenic-induced uterine disorders in response to the oral application of hydro-ethanolic extract of Moringa oleifera seed: a preliminary study.","The painful invasive chelation therapy makes it challenging to continue the prolonged treatment against arsenic toxicity. Hence, the significance of the present preliminary investigation was to explore a noninvasive treatment strategy against sodium arsenite (As3+) by the use of a hydroethanolic extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) seed. Arsenic treatment (10 mg/kg body-weight) in animals showed significant level of oxidative stress as evidenced by increased serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CD) and reduced level of non-protein thiol (NPSH). A significant diminution in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants was noted in As3+-treated rats. As3+ treatment showed a lengthy phase of metestrous in animals followed by significantly diminished ovarian steroidogenesis, increased ovarian follicular degeneration and distortion of uterine tissue histomorphology. In addition, there was a significant depletion of Vitamin-B9 (folate) and B12 following As3+ ingestion. The levels of circulating TNF-α, homocysteine (Hcy), uterine-IL-6, and liver metallothionein (MT-1) were significantly elevated in arsenic treated rats. MO at a dose of 100 mg/kg body-weight could successfully mitigate the uterine ROS generation by maintaining the uterine antioxidant status in As3+- treated rats. This seed extract prevented the deterioration of As3+-mediated ovarian-steroidogenesis and ovarian and uterine histoarchitecture significantly. B9 and B12 levels were also improved following the ingestion of the MO extract in arsenicated animals. Elevation of Hcy, TNF-α and IL-6 was also prevented by this MO seed extract in As3+-treated rats. A further increase of MT-1 level was achieved after MO ingestion in As3+-treated rats. Here, the alleviation of arsenic toxicity might involve via the regulation of the components of S-adenosine methionine (SAM) pool and MT-1."
2014,25313576,Patterns of dietary intake and serum carotenoid and tocopherol status are associated with biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk.,"Dietary modification may affect inflammatory processes and protect against chronic disease. In the present study, we examined the relationship between dietary patterns, circulating carotenoid and tocopherol concentrations, and biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in a 10-year longitudinal study of Scottish postmenopausal women. Diet was assessed by FFQ during 1997-2000 (n 3237, mean age 54·8 (SD 2·2) years). Participants (n 2130, mean age 66·0 (SD 2·2) years) returned during 2007-11 for follow-up. Diet was assessed by FFQ (n 1682) and blood was collected for the analysis of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, serum amyloid A, E-selectin, lipid profile and dietary biomarkers (carotenoids, tocopherols and retinol). Dietary pattern and dietary biomarker (serum carotenoid) components were generated by principal components analysis. A past 'prudent' dietary pattern predicted serum concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 (which decreased across the quintiles of the dietary pattern; P= 0·002 and P= 0·001, respectively; ANCOVA). Contemporary dietary patterns were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. The concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased across the quintiles of the 'prudent' dietary pattern (P= 0·030 and P= 0·006, respectively). hs-CRP concentration increased across the quintiles of a 'meat-dominated' dietary pattern (P= 0·001). Inflammatory biomarker concentrations decreased markedly across the quintiles of carotenoid component score (P< 0·001 for hs-CRP and IL-6, and P= 0·016 for E-selectin; ANCOVA). Prudent dietary pattern and carotenoid component scores were negatively associated with serum hs-CRP concentration (unstandardised β for prudent component: -0·053, 95% CI -0·102, -0·003; carotenoid component: -0·183, 95% CI -0·233, -0·134) independent of study covariates. A prudent dietary pattern (which reflects a diet high in the intakes of fish, yogurt, pulses, rice, pasta and wine, in addition to fruit and vegetable consumption) and a serum carotenoid profile characteristic of a fruit and vegetable-rich diet are associated with lower concentrations of intermediary markers that are indicative of CVD risk reduction."
2015,26228630,Mangiferin Inhibits Renal Urate Reabsorption by Modulating Urate Transporters in Experimental Hyperuricemia.,"Mangiferin, a natural glucosyl xanthone from the leaves of Mangifera indica L., was previously shown to exert potent hypouricemic effects associated with inhibition of the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase. The present study aimed to evaluate its uricosuric effect and possible molecular mechanisms underlying the renal urate transporters responsible for urate reabsorption in vivo. Mangiferin (1.5-24.0 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic mice and rats induced by the intraperitoneal injection of uric acid and potassium oxonate, respectively. The uricosuric effect was evaluated by determining the serum and urinary urate levels as well as fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA). The mRNA and protein levels of renal urate-anion transporter 1 (URAT1), organic anion transporter 10 (OAT10), glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), and PDZ domain-containing protein (PDZK1) were analyzed. The administration of mangiferin significantly decreased the serum urate levels in hyperuricemic mice in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In hyperuricemic rats, mangiferin also reduced the serum urate levels and increased the urinary urate levels and FEUA. These results indicate that mangiferin has uricosuric effects. Further examination showed that mangiferin markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of renal URAT1, OAT10, and GLUT9 in hyperuricemic rats, but did not interfere with PDZK1 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that mangiferin promotes urate excretion by the kidney, which may be related to the inhibition of urate reabsorption via downregulation of renal urate transporters.

2016,26830586,Determination of synthetic phenolic antioxidants in edible oils using microvial insert large volume injection gas-chromatography.,"Three synthetic phenolic antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), were determined in different edible vegetable oil samples. The analyses were carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using microvial insert large volume injection (LVI). Several parameters affecting this sample introduction step, such as temperatures, times and gas flows, were optimised. Quantification was carried out by the matrix-matched calibration method using carvacrol as internal standard, providing quantification limits between 0.08 and 0.10 ng g(-1), depending on the compound. The three phenolic compounds were detected in several of the samples, BHT being the most frequently found. Recovery assays for oil samples spiked at two concentration levels, 2.5 and 10 ng g(-1), provided recoveries in the 86-115% range."
2007,17658503,Chemo-preventive effect of Star anise in N-nitrosodiethylamine initiated and phenobarbital promoted hepato-carcinogenesis.,"The generation of free radicals is a cause of many pathological conditions like diabetes mellitus, cancer, stroke, etc. Free radicals cause damage to cellular DNA and initiate carcinogenesis. Free radicals also bring about proliferation of cells via cell signaling. An inverse relationship between the consumption of vegetable diets and the risk of cancer has been established. In the present study, Star anise (Illicium verum), which is a commonly used condiment in Indian cuisine, was assessed for its anti-carcinogenic potential in N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) initiated and phenobarbital (PB) promoted hepato-carcinogenesis. Rats were randomly selected for eight experimental groups. The carcinogenesis was induced by injecting the rats, with a single dose of NDEA (200mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally as initiator, followed by promotion with PB (0.05%) in drinking water for 14 consecutive weeks. The treatment with NDEA increased liver weight, while Star anise (Star) treatment reduced the liver weight of rats. The treatment with Star throughout for 20 weeks or during the promotion stage (6-20 weeks) significantly reduced the nodule incidence and nodule multiplicity in the rats, while the treatment with Star at the initiation phase (first 4 weeks) only could not reduce these parameters. The treatment with Star for 20 consecutive weeks significantly reduced the nodule size and nodule volume. The treatment with Star throughout as well as at the promotion stage lowered the lipid peroxidation (LPO) in liver and erythrocytes, while the LPO was not lowered, when Star was administered during initiation stage only. The treatment with Star restored the liver and erythrocyte super-oxide dismutase (SOD) activities to normal in the carcinogenesis-induced rats. The liver catalase (CAT) activity increased in all the treated groups. The erythrocyte CAT activity increased in the rats treated with Star during initiation and promotion stage only. The liver glutathione (GSH) level increased significantly in the groups treated with Star. The erythrocyte GSH level was lowered in the rats treated with NDEA and PB, however, Star treatment helped in increasing the erythrocyte GSH level to some extent. The liver and erythrocyte glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity increased in all the groups treated with NDEA and PB. The treatment with Star decreased GST level significantly. These results indicate that the treatment with Star reduces the tumor burden, lowers oxidative stress and increases the level of phase II enzymes, which may contribute to its anti-carcinogenic potential."
2009,19323986,Berberine against gastrointestinal peptides elevation and mucous secretion in hyperthyroid diarrheic rats.,"To investigate the underlying mechanisms of Berberine-mediated antidiarrheal effects in thyroid hormone-induced diarrhea in rats, gastrointestinal peptides, such as motilin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin from plasma and tissue of hyperthyroid diarrheic rats were measured using radioimmunoassay in healthy control, model, and treated model groups. The number and volume of goblet cells were also observed. Compared with healthy control, hyperthyroid diarrheic rats exhibited a significant reduction in body weight, and increase in plasma concentrations of tri-iodothyronine and free thyroxine along with the increase of wet stool. Both plasma motilin and gastrin were also elevated and reduced remarkably in Berberine-treated subgroup along with the body weight increased and wet stool reduced at the meantime. Significant changes in plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide and somatostatin were not seen. Gastrointestinal peptides trend in tissue samples were similar to those observed in plasma. Morphological data demonstrated an increase in number and/or volume of goblet cells to some extent in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively and decreased by administration of Berberine. The possible underlying mechanisms of antidiarrheal effects of Berberine may be due in partially to the reduction of the number of goblet cells and the amount of mucous secretion through re-balancing gastrointestinal peptides."
2018,30009768,Resveratrol represses estrogen-induced mammary carcinogenesis through NRF2-UGT1A8-estrogen metabolic axis activation.,"Estrogen plays a pivotal role in the pathological development of breast cancer. Resveratrol has chemo-preventive effects against breast cancer, whereas, the mechanism of antitumor activities of resveratrol remains unanswered. In this study, we showed that estrogen homeostasis profile was disturbed in both breast cancer patients and in experimental breast cancer model rats, with carcinogenic catechol estrogens significantly accumulated in the mammary tissues. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A8 (UGT1A8) is an important phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes which involved in the metabolism of catechol estrogens. Here we found that the mammary nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) - UGT1A8 signaling was down-regulated in breast cancer rats, whereas treatment with resveratrol could upregulate the expression of NRF2 and UGT1A8, accelerate metabolic elimination of catechol estrogens, inhibit estrogen-induced DNA damage and suppress the pathological development of breast cancer. In addition, luciferase reporter assay suggested that resveratrol activated the expression of UGT1A8 by up-regulating the transcriptional activity of NRF2. Small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of NRF2 abolished resveratrol-mediated preventive effects indicated that the antitumor effect of resveratrol is based on NRF2-UGT1A8-estrogen metabolism axis. Taken together, we established the resveratrol regulating potential on estrogen homeostasis based on NRF2-UGT1A8 signaling pathway, and also provided a novel link between estrogen glucuronidation metabolism and breast cancer pathological development."
2004,15621941,Influence of extremely-low-frequency magnetic field on antioxidative melatonin properties in AT478 murine squamous cell carcinoma culture.,"Effects of melatonin, extremely-low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF), and their combination on AT478 murine squamous cell carcinoma line were studied. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were used as markers of cells antioxidative status, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level was used as a marker of lipid peroxidation. After melatonin treatment, antioxidative enzyme activities were increased and MDA level was decreased. Application of ELF-MF on treated cells caused an increase of both superoxide dismutases activity and MDA level, but influence of ELF-MF on GSH-Px activity was negligible. All enzyme activity in culture medium containing melatonin (10(-3), 10(-4), 10(-5) M) after exposure to ELF-MF were significantly diminished compared to cells treated only with melatonin. Also MDA levels after combined treatment with melatonin and ELF-MF were significantly decreased. Observed changes were statistically significant (p<0.05). These results strongly suggest that ELF-MF attenuates antioxidative actions of melatonin on cellular level."
2006,16755036,UV-irradiated grapefruit juice loses pharmacokinetic interaction with nifedipine in rats.,"In the present study, UV-irradiated grapefruit juice was used to investigate the effects of UV light on nifedipine pharmacokinetics. Grapefruit juice in quartz vessels was UV irradiated (302 nm) with a transilluminator for 0 to 6 h at 4 degrees C, and furanocoumarins, potent contributors to the pharmacokinetic interaction, in each juice sample were measured using HPLC. The concentrations of all three types of furanocoumarins, bergamottin, 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, and bergaptol, decreased in a time-dependent manner. Concentrations of bergamottin, 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, and bergaptol were decreased to 1.66, 1.98, and 5.58%, respectively, after UV irradiation for 6 h. Two milliliters of untreated and UV-irradiated grapefruit juice were preadministered into the duodenum in rats to assess the effects of UV irradiation on nifedipine pharmacokinetics in vivo. After 30 min, nifedipine was intraduodenally administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight. The nifedipine concentrations in the plasma samples were determined using HPLC. A significant increase in the area under the concentration-time curve of nifedipine was observed in untreated grapefruit juice to 1.6-fold that in the control group, but not in the UV-irradiated grapefruit juice. These findings suggest that UV irradiation is useful to eliminate pharmacokinetic interactions with grapefruit juice."
2012,22953942,Antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory phenolics isolated from highbush blueberry flowers.,"Blueberries have been extensively researched, but there are limited studies on other parts of the plant. Here we report the first phytochemical examination of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) flowers, which yielded 21 phenolics. The compounds were identified from extensive NMR and mass spectral analyses and included five caffeic acid (1-5), three coumaric acid (6-8), and two cinnamyl alcohol (9-10) derivatives, eight flavonol glycosides (11-18), and three phenylpropanoid-substituted catechins (19-21). The isolates were evaluated for antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Overall, the flavonol glycosides and phenylpropanoid-substituted catechins showed superior antioxidant activities compared to the positive controls, vitamin C (IC(50)=63μM) and butylated hydroxytoluene (IC(50)=1548μM). Similarly, these phenolic sub-classes were more potent α-glucosidase inhibitors than the clinical drug, acarbose (IC(50)=200μM). Thus, non-consumed parts of food plants may be exploited as sources of bioactive compounds beyond their edible parts alone for nutraceutical and functional food applications."
2013,22335586,"Formulation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of transdermal patches containing risperidone.","The efficacy of oral risperidone treatment in prevention of schizophrenia is well known. However, oral side effects and patient compliance is always a problem for schizophrenics. In this study, risperidone was formulated into matrix transdermal patches to overcome these problems. The formulation factors for such patches, including eudragit RL 100 and eudragit RS 100 as matrix forming polymers, olive oil, groundnut oil and jojoba oil in different concentrations as enhancers and amount of drug loaded were investigated. The transdermal patches containing risperidone were prepared by solvent casting method and characterized for physicochemical and in vitro permeation studies through excised rat skin. Among the tested preparations, formulations with 20% risperidone, 3:2 ERL 100 and ERS 100 as polymers, mixture of olive oil and jojoba oil as enhancer, exhibited greatest cumulative amount of drug permeated (1.87 ± 0.09 mg/cm(2)) in 72 h, so batch ROJ was concluded as optimized formulation and assessed for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and skin irritation potential. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the optimized risperidone patch were determined using rabbits, while orally administered risperidone in solution was used for comparison. The calculated relative bioavailability of risperidone transdermal patch was 115.20% with prolonged release of drug. Neuroleptic efficacy of transdermal formulation was assessed by rota-rod and grip test in comparison with control and marketed oral formulations with no skin irritation. This suggests the transdermal application of risperidone holds promise for improved bioavailability and better management of schizophrenia in long-term basis."
2007,17966824,[Is periconceptional use of folic acid associated with a reduced risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate?].,"A recently observed decrease in the prevalence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate in the United States was associated with the folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grains, which became mandatory in 1998. Several case-control and one prospective study found an inverse association between intake of folic acid and/or multivitamins and the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate. A randomized trial to prove causality would be unethical, due to the established relationship between neural tube defects and periconceptional folic acid use. Until the results of carefully carried out cohort studies will be available, all women of childbearing age not under contraceptives should consume a diet rich in folate and take an additional daily dose of at least 0.4 (better 0.8) mg folic acid, preferably with a multivitamin, and until the end of the first twelve weeks after conception. With these recommendations for the prevention of neural tube defects, the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate may also be reduced."
2013,22455656,The effect of raw vegetable and fruit intake on thyroid cancer risk among women: a case-control study in South Korea.,"Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer among Korean women. However, there are few data on dietary factors related to thyroid cancer risk. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between raw vegetables and fruits intake and thyroid cancer in a case-control study. We included 111 histologically confirmed malignant thyroid cancer cases and 115 benign cases. Controls who did not have nodules in thyroid ultrasonography were matched to cases by age (± 2 years). Food and nutrient intakes were estimated using a quantitative FFQ with 121 items. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain OR and corresponding 95 % CI. The intake of total vegetables was not associated with malignant thyroid cancer, but inversely associated with benign cases. High raw vegetable intake was inversely associated with thyroid cancer risk both in malignant and benign cases (P for trend = 0·01 in both malignant and benign cases). Among fruits, persimmon intake had an inverse association with thyroid cancer risk in both malignant and benign cases (P for trend = 0·06 in malignant cases; P for trend = 0·01 in benign cases) and tangerine intake had an inverse association in malignant cases (P for trend = 0·03). The frequency of consumption of raw vegetables and persimmon also had a consistent inverse association in both malignant and benign cases. These results suggest that high consumption of raw vegetables, persimmons and tangerines may decrease thyroid cancer risk and help prevent early-stage thyroid cancer."
1993,8379502,Different postprandial metabolism of olive oil and soybean oil: a possible mechanism of the high-density lipoprotein conserving effect of olive oil.,"The postprandial lipoprotein metabolism of two orally administered vitamin A-fat loads consisting of either 20% (wt:vol) soybean oil or 17% olive oil plus 3% soybean oil was studied in six normolipidemic young men according to a randomized crossover design. Mean (+/- SEM) retinyl palmitate concentrations (area under the 24-h curve) were higher in olive oil chylomicrons (97.3 +/- 5.5 mmol.L-1 x h-1), than in soybean-oil chylomicrons (84.0 +/- 10.5 mmol.L-1 x h-1; P < 0.02). Apolipoprotein B-48 concentrations were higher in the olive oil chylomicron remnants with densities (d) of 1.006-1.019 compared with soybean-oil remnants. The slower removal of olive oil chylomicron remnants was correlated to hepatic lipase activity (r = 0.84, P < 0.02). The initial HDL-cholesterol concentration (0.87 +/- 0.17 mmol/L--relatively low but within the normal range for young Dutch men) decreased significantly after ingestion of soybean oil to 0.66 +/- 0.10 mmol/L after 5 and 7 h, but no significant decrease was observed after olive oil ingestion. Soybean oil induced decreases in HDLs correlated inversely with hepatic lipase (r = -0.88, P < 0.02). The results suggested that competition between olive oil chylomicron remnants and HDL for hepatic lipase may have been the underlying mechanism that prevented the postprandial decrease in HDL cholesterol."
1990,2343456,Preventive effect of zinc against cadmium-induced bone resorption.,"The effects of cadmium and zinc on bone resorption were investigated using fetal mouse calvaria organ culture. Cadmium treatment (0.5 microM) stimulated bone resorption in fetal mouse calvaria via prostaglandin E2 production. Concomitant treatment of zinc with cadmium prevented bone resorption by cadmium in a dose-dependent manner of zinc. The zinc treatment also prevented the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production by cadmium. ID50 of zinc for bone resorption showed high similarity to that for prostaglandin E2 production (1.2 microM and 1.6 microM, respectively). To simplify the system, we used osteoclast-enriched and osteoblast-enriched cell populations obtained from mice calvariae by collagenase digestion method. Prostaglandin E2 was produced in osteoblast-enriched cell culture more than in osteoclast-enriched cell culture. Cadmium stimulated prostaglandin E2 production in osteoblast-enriched cell culture, but not in osteoclast-enriched cell culture. Zinc also prevented the stimulatory effect of cadmium on prostaglandin E2 production in osteoblast-enriched cell culture. Zinc partially, but significantly, inhibited cadmium-accumulation in both calvaria and osteoblast-enriched cell culture. These results strongly suggest that zinc prevents cadmium-induced prostaglandin E2 production and bone resorption through the interaction between the two metals on osteoblasts involved in the inhibition of cadmium-accumulation."
2012,22666109,An efficient in vitro propagation protocol of cocoyam [Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L) Schott].,"Sprouted corm sections of ""South Dade"" white cocoyam were potted and maintained in a greenhouse for 8 weeks. Shoot tips of 3-5 mm comprising the apical meristem with 4-6 leaf primordial, and approximately 0.5 mm of corm tissue at the base. These explants were treated to be used into the culture medium. A modified Gamborg's B5 mineral salts supplemented with 0.05 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were used throughout the study. Thidiazuron (TDZ) solution containing 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used. Erlenmeyer flasks and test tubes were used for growing cultures. The effect of different media substrate, thidiazuron, and the interaction between TDZ and Benzylaminopurine (BAP) on cocoyam culture were tested. Results indicated that cocoyam can be successfully micropropagated in vitro through various procedures. All concentrations tested (5-20 μM BAP and 1-4 μM TDZ) produced more axillary shoots per shoot tip than the control without cytokinins. Greater proliferation rates were obtained through the use of 20 μM BAP and 2 μM TDZ, respectively, 12 weeks from initiation. Shoots produced with BAP were larger and more normal in appearance than those produced with TDZ, which were small, compressed, and stunted. The use of stationary liquid media is recommended for economic reasons."
2014,25199697,Effect of cinnamon and its procyanidin-B2 enriched fraction on diabetic nephropathy in rats.,"Non-enzymatic protein glycation and resultant accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications including diabetic nephropathy (DN). It is considered that antiglycating agents offer protection against AGE mediated pathologies including DN. Earlier we characterized procyanidin-B2 (PCB2) as the active component from cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) that inhibits AGE formation in vitro. In this study, we have investigated the potential of PCB2-enriched fraction of cinnamon to prevent in vivo accumulation of AGE and to ameliorate renal changes in diabetic rats. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fed with either 3% cinnamon or 0.002% PCB2-fraction in diet for 12weeks. Biochemical analysis of blood and urine was performed at the end of experiment. Evaluation of glomerular markers that serve as indicators of renal function was done by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and qRT-PCR. Supplementation of diabetic rats with cinnamon and PCB2-fraction prevented glycation mediated RBC-IgG cross-links and HbA1c accumulation in diabetes rats. Cinnamon and PCB2-fraction also inhibited the accumulation of N-carboxy methyl lysine (CML), a prominent AGE in diabetic kidney. Interestingly, cinnamon and its PCB2-fraction prevented the AGE mediated loss of expression of glomerular podocyte proteins; nephrin and podocin. Inhibition of AGE by cinnamon and PCB2-fraction ameliorated the diabetes mediated renal malfunction in rats as evidenced by reduced urinary albumin and creatinine. In conclusion, PCB2 from cinnamon inhibited AGE accumulation in diabetic rat kidney and ameliorated AGE mediated pathogenesis of DN. "
2013,23743330,Lycium barbarum polysaccharides reduce intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injuries in rats.,"Inflammation and oxidative stress exert important roles in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) have shown effective antioxidative and immunomodulatory functions in different models. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects and potential mechanisms of LBPs in intestinal IRI. Several free radical-generating and lipid peroxidation models were used to assess the antioxidant activities of LBPs in vitro. A common IRI model was used to induce intestinal injury by clamping and unclamping the superior mesenteric artery in rats. Changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, activated nuclear factor (NF)-κB, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, and related antioxidant enzyme levels, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) accumulation, intestinal permeability, and intestinal histology were examined. We found that LBPs exhibited marked inhibitory action against free radicals and lipid peroxidation in vitro. LBPs increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reduced intestinal oxidative injury in animal models of intestinal IRI. In addition, LBPs inhibited PMN accumulation and ICAM-1 expression and ameliorated changes in the TNF-α level, NF-κB activation, intestinal permeability, and histology. Our results indicate that LBPs treatment may protect against IRI-induced intestinal damage, possibly by inhibiting IRI-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. "
2007,17910620,The in vitro inhibitory potential of trade herbal products on human CYP2D6-mediated metabolism and the influence of ethanol.,"The six commonly used trade herbal products, St. John's wort, common valerian, common sage, Ginkgo biloba, Echinacea purpurea and horse chestnut, and ethanol, were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potential of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)-mediated metabolism. Herbal components were extracted from commercially available products in a way that ensured the same composition of constituents in the extract as in the original trade products. c-DNA baculovirus expressed CYP2D6 was used with dextromethorphan as substrate. Quinidine was included as a positive control inhibitor. A validated high performance liquid chromatography methodology was used to quantify the formation of dextrorphan (product of dextromethorphan O-demethylation). Ethanol showed a biphasic effect on CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing initially the CYP2D6 activity with 175% of control up to a concentration of 1.1%, where after ethanol linearly inhibited the CYP2D6 activity. All the investigated herbs inhibited CYP2D6 activity to some extent, but only St. John's wort, common sage and common valerian were considered possible candidates for in vivo clinically significant effects. They showed IC50 values of 0.07 +/- 7 x 10(-3) mg/ml, 0.8 +/- 0.05 mg/ml and 1.6 +/- 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. St. John's wort inhibited CYP2D6-mediated metabolism in an uncompetitive manner, while common valerian and common sage in a non-competitive manner demonstrated interherb differences in inhibition patterns and differences when compared to the more homogenous competitive inhibitor quinidine. Common valerian was the only herb that showed a mechanistic inhibition of CYP2D6 activity and attention should be paid to a possible toxicity of this herb."
2006,17015939,Differential activation of glucose transport in cultured muscle cells by polyphenolic compounds from Canna indica L. Root.,"Effects of extracts of a plant, which has been used as a traditional medicine for treating diabetes on glucose transport activity was evaluated in cultured L8 muscle cells. The aqueous extract of Canna indica root (CI) at doses of 0.1-0.5 mg/ml, which contains total phenolic compounds equivalent to 6-30 microg of catechin caused a dose- and time-dependent induction of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (2-DG) uptake activity. The induced 2-DG uptake was significantly increased within 8 h and reached a maximum by 16 h. The CI extract increased the amount of glucose transporter isoforms 1 (GLUT1) and 4 (GLUT4) at the cell surface and enhanced expression of GLUT1 protein. Cycloheximide treatment almost completely reversed CI-induced 2-DG uptake to the basal level. Exposure of muscle cells to wortmannin and SB203580 diminished CI-mediated glucose uptake by 38 and 14%, respectively. The effect of CI and insulin was partially additive. Phytochemical analysis detected the presence of flavonoids and catechol in the CI. Taken together, these data provide evidence for differential effects of CI on regulated-glucose transport in muscle cells. Our findings suggest that GLUT1 protein synthesis and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are critical for the increase in glucose transporter activity at the plasma membrane and essential for the maximal induction of glucose transport by CI in L8 muscle cells."
2018,29428670,Protective effects of Punica granatum (pomegranate) peel extract on concanavalin A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice.,"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of an unknown etiology, glucocorticoid therapy is currently recognized as an effective treatment for AIH, but conventional application and patient compliance are both hindered by its side effects. The exploration of the AIH pathogenesis and the searching for the new candidate drugs that exert potential activity and low toxicity are urgently needed. Pomegranate peel extract (PoPx) is a natural extract of Punica granatum and has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The present study aimed to clarify the effect of PoPx on the concanavalin A (ConA)-induced autoimmune hepatitis in a mouse model that is well established at 12h after tail vein injection with a dose of 20 mg/kg of ConA. C57BL/6 female mice were pretreated with PoPx (250 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) followed by a ConA challenge. Pretreatment with PoPx significantly alleviated ConA-induced liver injury by down-regulating the levels of plasma alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and cytokine, including TNF-α, interferon (IFN) -γ and interleukin (IL)-6. Moreover, liver hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining displayed a lighter inflammatory infiltration around the portal area in the PoPx-pretreated mice. In addition, the flow cytometry (FCM) data showed that the immune response in the liver was died down in the PoPx-pretreated condition. Specially, pretreatment with PoPx reduced the infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the liver. Taken together, these findings contributed to a better understanding of the actions of PoPx against acute AIH and indicated that PoPx might be a potential compound in treating T cell-mediated autoimmune liver injury."
2007,17459051,Impact of imatinib therapy on the use of allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia.,"The discovery and approval of imatinib drastically changed the therapeutic algorithm for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Imatinib is now considered the therapy of choice for patients with newly diagnosed CML, including those previously considered candidates for allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We compared numbers and types of allogeneic HCTs performed for CML in North America before and after the introduction of imatinib, and publication of the International Randomized Trial of Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) using transplants reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). The number of HCTs for CML registered with the CIBMTR in 1998 was 617; 62% were performed in first chronic phase (CP1). Only 1% of patients had received imatinib prior to transplantation. In 2003, the number of HCTs reported was 223; 44% were performed in CP1 and 77% of patients received imatinib prior to transplantation. The introduction of imatinib therapy has had a profound impact on the use of allogeneic transplantation for CML, with a marked decrease in the number of transplants for CML and an accompanying decrease in the proportion done in CP1. Most patients now receive a trial of imatinib before proceeding to HCT."
2010,21039758,Fruit juice inhibition of uptake transport: a new type of food-drug interaction.,"A new type of interaction in which fruit juices diminish oral drug bioavailability through inhibition of uptake transport is the focus of this review. The discovery was based on an opposite to anticipated finding when assessing the possibility of grapefruit juice increasing oral fexofenadine bioavailability in humans through inhibition of intestinal MDR1-mediated efflux transport. In follow-up investigations, grapefruit or orange juice at low concentrations potentially and selectively inhibited in vitro OATP1A2-mediated uptake compared with MDR1-caused efflux substrate transport. These juices at high volume dramatically depressed oral fexofenadine bioavailability. Grapefruit was the representative juice to characterize the interaction subsequently. A volume-effect relationship study using a normal juice amount halved average fexofenadine absorption. Individual variability and reproducibility data indicated the clinical interaction involved direct inhibition of intestinal OATP1A2. Naringin was a major causal component suggesting that other flavonoids in fruits and vegetables might also produce the effect. Duration of juice clinical inhibition of fexofenadine absorption lasted more than 2 h but less than 4 h indicating the interaction was avoidable with appropriate interval of time between juice and drug consumption. Grapefruit juice lowered the oral bioavailability of several medications transported by OATP1A2 (acebutolol, celiprolol, fexofenadine, talinolol, L-thyroxine) while orange juice did the same for others (atenolol, celiprolol, ciprofloxacin, fexofenadine). Juice clinical inhibition of OATP2B1 was unresolved while that of OATP1B1 seemed unlikely. The interaction between grapefruit juice and etoposide also seemed relevant. Knowledge of both affected uptake transporter and drug hydrophilicity assisted prediction of the clinical interaction with grapefruit or orange juice."
2003,12913286,Anti-obesity effect of Dioscorea nipponica Makino with lipase-inhibitory activity in rodents.,"In the process of screening for pancreatic lipase inhibitors, which could be used as an anti-obesity measure, the methanol extract of Dioscorea nipponica Makino powder (DP) appeared to have potent inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic lipase with an IC50 value of 5-10 microg/ml, where the enzyme activity was assayed by using 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate as a substrate. Further purification of active components present in the herb generated dioscin that belongs to the saponin family. Dioscin and its aglycone, diosgenin, both suppressed the time-dependent increase of blood triacylglycerol level when orally injected with corn oil to mice, suggesting their inhibitory potential against fat absorption. Sprague-Dawley rats fed on a high-fat diet containing 5% Dioscorea nipponica Makino and 40% beef tallow gained significantly less body weight and adipose tissue than control animals fed on a high-fat diet alone during an 8-week experimental period (P<0.05)."
2016,26948642,Chemical composition and antioxidant capacity of different anatomical parts of pear (Pyrus communis L.).,"Sugar, organic acid, triterpenoid and phenolic composition as well as antioxidant capacity of different anatomical parts of pear were studied. Fruits and leaves of 'Radana' pear (Pyrus communis L.) were used. The results showed great quantitative differences in the composition of the pear pulp, peel, leaves and seeds. Fructose was the major sugar in pulp, seeds and peel (227.46, 45.36 and 67.49 g/kg dry mass [DM], respectively), while sorbitol was predominant in leaves (40.66 g/kg DM). Malic acid was the major organic acid, followed by citric and shikimic acids. The highest concentration of triterpenoids (3460.5 μg/g DM) was determined in pear peel, and ursolic acid was predominant. Leaves were characterized by the highest amount of phenolics (5326.7 mg/100 g DM) and the highest DPPH and FRAP values (2027.9 and 3539.6 μmol TE/100 g DM, respectively). Pear leaves and seeds may be selected as potential sources of phytochemicals."
2005,16115330,Changes in arterial blood pressure in hypertensive rats caused by long-term intake of milk fermented by Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5728.,"We have evaluated the changes in arterial blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by long-term intake of an Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk with significant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity. After being weaned, male 3-week-old SHR were randomized into five groups. Until the 20th week of life, rats in each group were given one of the following drinking fluids: tap water (negative control 1), a fermented milk without ACE-inhibitory activity (negative control 2), captopril (100 mg/kg) (positive control), the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk that had significant ACE-inhibitory activity, or Ca-enriched E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk. Animals in the different groups were then given tap water as drinking fluid from the 20th to 25th week of life. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured weekly in the rats, from the 6th to 25th week of life, by the tail-cuff method. A definite decrease in SBP and DBP could be observed in the rats treated with captopril and also in the rats that received the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milks. The greatest antihypertensive effect was observed when the pharmacological treatment was administered. The effect of the Ca-enriched fermented milk was slightly more accentuated and more constant than the effect of the E. faecalis CECT 5728-fermented milk that had not been enriched in Ca. SBP and DBP increased in the treated SHR when the corresponding antihypertensive treatment was removed. Fermentation of milk with E. faecalis CECT 5728 may therefore be a successful strategy to produce a functional food with antihypertensive activity."
,2764515,Lectin binding sites of cultured ovarian Sertoli cell tumors and follicular granulosa cells.,"A panel of seven alkaline phosphatase labeled lectins was used to probe nitrocellulose electroblots of SDS-PAGE separated proteins from a primary culture of normal ovarian granulosa cells and an ENU-induced Sertoli cell tumor cell line (SCTL-I). Several additional lectin binding proteins were observed in silver stained SDS-PAGE gels as well as with lectins in SCTL-I. Succinated concanavalin A (Suc. Con A), Ricin communis agglutinin (RCA-I), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA 1), Soybean agglutinin (SBA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and Peanut agglutinin (PNA) stained more intensely in SCTL-I than normal granulosa cells. The same lectins as above, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), were used to study the distribution of specific binding sites of tissue cultured cells grown in chamber/slides. Both normal ovarian granulosa cells and SCT cells exhibited strong peninuclear cytoplasmic labeling with Con A UEA-1 and WGA exhibited predominantly a nuclear and granular cytoplasmic staining pattern. SBA and DBA exhibited a strong coarse granular cytoplasmic labeling in granulosa cells and moderate granular cytoplasmic in SCT cells. In granulosa cells, Golgi regions stained strongly with PNA but weakly in SCT cells. RCA-I staining was negative in both cultures. Labeling of tissue cultured cells with lectins provides more details than histological sections of lectins binding sites at cellular structural levels."
1999,10398312,Effect of zinc supplementation on incidence of infections and hospital admissions in sickle cell disease (SCD).,"Zinc deficiency is a common nutritional problem in adult sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients. Hyperzincuria and increased requirement of zinc due to continued hemolysis in SCD are probable bases for zinc deficiency in these patients. Zinc deficiency affects adversely T-helper1 (TH1) functions and cell mediated immunity and interleukin (IL)-2 production is decreased in zinc deficient subjects. We hypothesized that zinc supplementation will improve T-helper1 function and decrease incidence of infections in patients with SCD. We tested this hypothesis in 32 SCD subjects who were divided in three groups (Grs A, B, and C). Grs A (n = 11) and B (n = 10) were zinc deficient based on cellular zinc criteria and Gr C (n = 11) were zinc sufficient. Gr A subjects were observed for 1 year (baseline), following which they received zinc acetate (50 to 75 mg of elemental zinc orally daily) for 3 years. Gr B subjects were observed for 1 year (baseline), following which they received placebo for 1 year and then switched to zinc supplementation (50 to 75 mg of elemental zinc orally daily) for 2 years. Gr C subjects did not receive any intervention inasmuch as they were zinc sufficient. Prolonged zinc supplementation resulted in an increase in lymphocyte and granulocyte zinc (P = 0.0001), and an increase in interleukin-2 production (P = 0.0001), decreased incidence of documented bacteriologically positive infections (P = 0.0026), decreased number of hospitalizations and decreased number of vaso-occlusive pain crisis (P = 0.0001). The predominant pathogens isolated were staphylococci and streptococci involving the respiratory tract and aerobic gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, involving the urinary tract. Further confirmation of our observations will require prospective studies of zinc supplementation in a larger number of SCD patients."
2009,19497426,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate exhibits anti-fibrotic effect by attenuating bleomycin-induced glycoconjugates, lysosomal hydrolases and ultrastructural changes in rat model pulmonary fibrosis.","Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components in the alveolar space, which hampers normal respiration process. Pathophysiological enzymes, glycoprotein moieties and matrix degrading lysosomal hydrolases are key markers and play a crucial role in the progression of fibrosis. Bleomycin is an anti-neoplastic drug, used for the treatment of various types of cancers and induces pulmonary fibrosis due its deleterious side effect. Tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is known for its wide array of beneficial effects. The present study was intended to evaluate the beneficial efficacy of EGCG against bleomycin-induced glycoconjugates, lysosomal hydrolases and ultrastructural changes in the lungs of Wistar rats. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (6.5 U/kg body weight) to rats increased the activities of pathophysiological enzymes such as aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, which were attenuated upon EGCG treatment. The increased level of hydroxyproline and histopathological parameters in bleomycin-induced rats were decreased upon EGCG treatment. Bleomycin-induced increase in the level of glycoconjugates was restored closer to normal levels on EGCG treatment. Furthermore, the increased activities of matrix degrading lysosomal enzymes in bleomycin-induced rats were reduced upon EGCG supplementation. Treatment with EGCG also attenuated bleomycin-induced ultrastructural changes as observed from transmission electron microscopy studies. The results of the present study put-forward EGCG as a potential anti-fibrotic agent due to its attenuating effect on potential fibrotic markers."
2006,16880594,Functional myo-inositol catabolic genes of Bacillus subtilis Natto are involved in depletion of pinitol in Natto (fermented soybean).,"Soybeans are rich in pinitol (PI; 3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol), which improves health by treating conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity. Natto is a food made from soybeans fermented by strains of Bacillus subtilis natto. In the chromosome of natto strain OK2, there is a putative promoter region almost identical to the iol promoter for myo-inositol (MI) catabolic genes of B. subtilis 168. In the presence of MI, the putative iol promoter functioned to induce inositol dehydrogenase, the enzyme for the first-step reaction in the MI catabolic pathway. PI also induced inositol dehydrogenase and the promoter was indispensable for the utilization of PI as well as MI, suggesting that PI might be an alternative carbon source metabolized in a way involving the MI catabolic genes. Natto fermentation studies have revealed that the parental natto strain consumed PI while a mutant defective in the iol promoter did not do so at all. These results suggest that inactivating the MI catabolic genes might prevent PI consumption, retaining it in natto for enrichment of possible health-promoting properties."
2014,24444903,Free and glycosidically bound aroma compounds in cherry (Prunus avium L.).,"This paper reports the occurrence of both free and glycosidically bound aroma compounds in three sweet cherry cultivars ('Hongdeng', 'Hongyan' and 'Rainier'), with 97 compounds being identified in the three cultivars. The major free volatile compounds found were hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde. The major bound volatile compounds found were benzyl alcohol, geraniol, 2-phenylethanol. Also 4-vinylphenol was found in cherry fruit for the first time, and has a relatively high concentration of the glycosidically-bound form in 'Rainier'. Odour activity values (OAVs) were determined for both free and bound volatiles, with 18 compounds having an OAV above 1. The highest OAVs for three cultivars were (E)-β-ionone, hexanal, decanal and (E)-2-hexenal with the highest being over 800 for (E)-β-ionone in 'Honyang'. From these results, it was concluded that the aroma compounds present were similar in all three cultivars, but there was significant variation found in their levels and hence contribution to the aroma of these cultivars.

2019,29958046,Putative Effect of Spirulina Extract on Enzyme Activities Participating in Lipid and Carbohydrate Digestion Processes.,"Excessive calorie intake is generally accepted as a primary cause of metabolic syndrome, and therefore a well-balanced diet and moderate exercise can be expected to be the most effective measures to avoid the disorder of energy utilization and storage. Furthermore, as any other way to improve the disorder of energy balance, it may be effective to delay and lower the digestion and/or absorption of energy sources, lipids, and carbohydrates. As a primary screening of effective substances to delay and lower the digestion and absorption processes among natural materials, the protein-deprived extract was prepared from blue-green algae Spirulina platensis, and the effect of this extract on lipase and α-glucosidase activities was examined. The extract was shown to inhibit lipase activity but not α-glucosidase activity, thus proposing the possibility that the extract prevented the postprandial elevation of blood triglyceride (TG) levels as a result of reducing the digestion and absorption of lipids in the intestinal tract. Therefore, it seems possible to speculate that nonprotein components of Spirulina may be able to effectively improve the disorder of energy balance as a consequence of suppressing the excessive intake of calories by reducing the absorption of lipids in patients with metabolic syndrome."
,2764514,Lectin binding sites in normal rat ovary and ENU-induced Sertoli cell tumors of the ovaries.,"A panel of seven fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled lectins were used to study the distribution of specific binding sites in histologic sections of rat ovaries and ENU-induced Sertoli cell tumors (SCT) of the ovaries. Ten SCT and 5 normal ovaries derived from Berlin Druckey IV (BD-IV) rats were examined by FITC lectins. The tissues examined were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. In normal ovaries, lectin binding sites were more uniform, ordered and consistent than in ovarian SCT where some lectin staining appeared disorderly inconsistent and varied with the degree of tumor differentiation. Two lectins, (from Triticum vulgaris [WGA] and Arachis hypogaea [PNA], uniformly stained the apices of the ovarian surface epithelium and subadjacent tunica vaginalis. The ovarian stroma, oocyte nucleus, follicular and granulosa-theca cells, stained uniformly strong with succinated Con A (from Con-canavalia ensiformis). Three lectins (from Triticum vulgaris, Ulex europeaus [UEA-1] and Arachis hypogeae) accentuated the basal lamina in the SCT and normal ovarian follicles. The zona pellucida was strongly labeled with lectin derived from Triticum vulgaris, Ricinus communis (RCA) and moderately with lectin derived from Arachis hypogeae. The oviduct ampulla exhibited an intracytoplasmic strong vesicular labeling with lectins derived from Triticum vulgare, Dolichos biflorus (DBA), Glycin max (Soybean-SBA) and Arachis hypogeae. The SCT cells showed an inconsistent, irregular labeling pattern with lectins derived from Ulex europaeus, Dolichos biflorus and Soybean mostly as a coarse granular cytoplasmic labeling. Neuraminidase digestion enhanced lectin staining with PNA in normal ovary and in SCT. This data provided at list of lectin markers for distinct components of the BD-IV rat ovary and ovarian SCT."
2014,25451569,Blueberry anthocyanins-enriched extracts attenuate the cyclophosphamide-induced lung toxicity.,"The influence of blueberry anthocyanins-enriched extracts (BAE) on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced lung damage was investigated. BAE (20 and 80mg/kg/d) were orally dosed to rats 7d both before and after CTX administration (100mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, single dose). The results showed CTX treatment induced obvious pathological pulmonary injury with raised injury score and lung/body weight ratio. In CTX group, the activity of lysosomal proteases, lung permeability and the number of neutrophil infiltrates all elevated. On the other hand, claudin-4 and zonula occluden-1 protein levels decreased. And also changes of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines parameters together with nuclear factor-κB activation were shown. Improvement of all above-mentioned physiological and biochemical parameters was exhibited in BAE groups, with a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, BAE attenuate the CTX-induced lung toxicity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics are involved in the protective mechanism of BAE. "

2014,25478596,Significance of algal polymer in designing amphotericin B nanoparticles.,"Development of oral amphotericin B (AmB) loaded nanoparticles (NPs) demands a novel technique which reduces its toxicity and other associated problems. Packing of AmB in between two oppositely charged ions by polyelectrolyte complexation technique proved to be a successful strategy. We have developed a novel carrier system in form of polyelectrolyte complex of AmB by using chitosan (CS) and porphyran (POR) as two oppositely charged polymers with TPP as a crosslinking agent. Initially POR was isolated from Porphyra vietnamensis followed by the fact that its alkali induced safe reduction in molecular weight was achieved. Formulation was optimized using three-factor three-level (3(3)) central composite design. High concentration of POR in NPs was confirmed by sulfated polysaccharide (SP) assay. Degradation and dissolution studies suggested the stability of NPs over wide pH range. Hemolytic toxicity data suggested the safety of prepared formulation. In vivo and in vitro antifungal activity demonstrated the high antifungal potential of optimized formulation when compared with standard drug and marketed formulations. Throughout the study TPP addition did not cause any significant changes. Therefore, these experimental oral NPs may represent an interesting carrier system for the delivery of AmB. "
2018,28561324,Curcumin Ameliorates Kidney Function and Oxidative Stress in Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to involve inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the impact of curcumin (diferuloyl methane, a phenolic turmeric pigment), which has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities on kidney structure and function in rats with adenine-induced CKD. Rats were treated for 5 weeks with adenine to induce CKD-like renal damage and combined with three doses of curcumin. Markers of kidney function and oxidative stress were quantified in plasma, urine, renal homogenates and on kidney tissue. Curcumin was found to significantly abate adenine-induced toxic effects such as reduced creatinine clearance, elevated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels and raised urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activities. Curcumin markedly reduced renal morphological damage and histopathological markers of inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis. Curcumin further reduced adenine-induced hypertension, urinary albumin, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, cystatin C and adiponectin. It restored plasma sclerostin concentrations and lowered oxidative stress in renal homogenates. In animals treated with the two higher curcumin concentrations, alone or in combination with adenine, an increased expression of the antioxidative transcription factor Nrf2 was found as well as up-regulation of the activity of its direct target glutathione reductase, and of an indirect target, the glutathione level. In conclusion, curcumin exhibits salutary effects against adenine-induced CKD in rats by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress via up-regulation of the transcription factor Nrf2."
2008,18481011,"Heterocyclic compounds from Chrysanthemum coronarium L. and their inhibitory activity on hACAT-1, hACAT-2, and LDL-oxidation.","The aerial parts of Chrysanthemum coronarium L. were extracted with MeOH, and the concentrated extract was partitioned using EtOAc, n-BuOH, and H(2)O, successively. Repeated column chromatography of the EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions gave a new heterocycle, 5,5'-dibuthoxy-2,2'-bifuran (1) along with five known compounds: methyl trans-ferulate (2), prunasin (3), sambunigrin (4), pterolactam (5), and adenosine (6), which were identified by several spectroscopic methods including NMR and MS. This paper is the first report on the isolation of these compounds from C. coronarium L. The IC(50) values of compound 1 for human Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (hACAT)-1 and hACAT-2 were 0.16 mM and 0.19 mM, respectively. Compound 2 inhibited low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation with an IC(50) value of 7.7 microM."
2008,18704331,Anti-platelet effects of flavonoids and flavonoid-glycosides from Sophora japonica.,"A methanol extract of Sophora japonica was subjected to anti-platelet activity guided fractionation affording the isolation of four flavonoids and six flavonoid-glycosides: biochanin A (1), irisolidone (2), genistein (3), sissotrin (4), sophorabioside (5), genistin (6), tectoridin (7), apigenin (8), quercitrin (9), and rutin (10). The structure of each compound was determined by a variety of spectroscopic methods. Among the compounds, 1, 3, and 7 showed approximately 2.5-6.5 fold greater inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid (AA) and U46619 induced platelet aggregation (IC50: 19.9 and 99.8 microM; 20.3 and 53.8 microM; 25.9 and 123.4 microM, respectively) than acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, IC50: 63.0 and 350.0 microM). Compound 2 was an approximately 22-40 fold stronger inhibitor than ASA on AA and U46619 induced aggregation (IC50: 1.6 and 15.6 microM, respectively)."
2014,24365548,Sensory polyneuropathy in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients receiving tuberculosis treatment.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and treatments for HIV infection and tuberculosis (TB) are associated with the risk of developing sensory polyneuropathy (SPN). Vitamin B6 and genetically determined slow isoniazid (INH) acetylation are believed to play key roles in the development of SPN in a TB treatment setting.To investigate slow acetylation and risk factors for SPN in HIV-infected patients receiving TB treatment, and establish vitamin B6 status and its association with SPN.HIV-infected in-patients were prospectively assessed after initiating TB treatment and vitamin B6 supplementation, and monthly during hospitalisation. SPN was defined as ≥1 symptom plus ≥1 sign. NAT2 genotyping predicted acetylation status, and plasma high performance liquid chromatography estimated vitamin B6 status. A survival analysis estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for SPN during TB treatment.Of 116 participants, 56% had SPN at study entry. Participants developed SPN at a rate of 26/100 person-months (95%CI 18-35) during TB treatment, which was independently associated with slow acetylation (HR 2.5; 95%CI 1.1-5.9), as well as black race, previous TB and extra-pulmonary/disseminated TB. Vitamin B6 status was normal, irrespective of SPN.Risk factors for SPN suggest a multi-factorial pathogenesis related to INH and other potential nervous system insults. SPN developed despite normal vitamin B6 status, suggesting other mechanisms of injury."
2004,15760092,Gastroretentive drug delivery system of ranitidine hydrochloride: formulation and in vitro evaluation.,"The purpose of this research was to prepare a gastroretentive drug delivery system of ranitidine hydrochloride. Guar gum, xanthan gum, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were evaluated for gel-forming properties. Sodium bicarbonate was incorporated as a gas-generating agent. The effects of citric acid and stearic acid on drug release profile and floating properties were investigated. The addition of stearic acid reduces the drug dissolution due to its hydrophobic nature. A 3(2) full factorial design was applied to systemically optimize the drug release profile. The amounts of citric acid anhydrous (X1) and stearic acid (X2) were selected as independent variables. The times required for 50% (t50) and 80% drug dissolution (t80), and the similarity factor f2 were selected as dependent variables. The results of the full factorial design indicated that a low amount of citric acid and a high amount of stearic acid favors sustained release of ranitidine hydrochloride from a gastroretentive formulation. A theoretical dissolution profile was generated using pharmacokinetic parameters of ranitidine hydrochloride. The similarity factor f2 was applied between the factorial design batches and the theoretical dissolution profile. No significant difference was observed between the desired release profile and batches F2, F3, F6, and F9. Batch F9 showed the highest f2 (f2 = 75) among all the batches, and this similarity is also reflected in t50 (approximately 214 minutes) and t80 (approximately 537 minutes) values. These studies indicate that the proper balance between a release rate enhancer and a release rate retardant can produce a drug dissolution profile similar to a theoretical dissolution profile."
2014,24215635,"The protective effect of thiamine pyrophosphate, but not thiamine, against cardiotoxicity induced with cisplatin in rats.","This study investigated the effect of thiamine pyrophosphate on oxidative damage associated with cardiotoxicity caused by cisplatin (CIS), an antineoplastic agent, in rats, and compared this with thiamine. Animals used in the study were divided into four groups of 6 rats each. These represented a control group receiving 5 mg/kg of CIS, study groups receiving 20 mg/kg of thiamine pyrophosphate plus 5 mg/kg of cisplatin (CTPG) or 20 mg/kg of thiamine plus 5 mg/kg of cisplatin and a healthy (H) group. All doses were administered intraperitoneally once a day for 14 days. Malondialdehyde, total glutathione and products of DNA injury results were similar in the CTPG and H groups (p > 0.05). Creatinine kinase, creatine kinase MB and troponin 1 levels were similar in the CTPG and H groups (p > 0.05). Thiamine pyrophosphate prevented CIS-associated oxidative stress and heart injury, whereas thiamine did not prevent these."
1997,9416990,Functional characterization of neural and smooth muscle motilin receptors in the chicken proventriculus and ileum.,"To characterize the motilin receptors present in the chicken, the effects of chicken motilin (Phe-Val-Pro-Phe-Phe-Thr-Gln-Ser-Asp-Ile-Gln-Lys-Met-Gln-Glu-Lys-Glu-Arg -Asn-Lys-Gly-Gln), Leu13 porcine motilin, canine motilin and three erythromycin derivatives (EMA, EM523, GM611) on the contractility of the chicken gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscles were investigated in vitro and compared with those in the rabbit duodenum. In the proventriculus longitudinal and circular muscle layers, chicken motilin (3 nM-1 microM) caused an atropine- and a tetrodotoxin-sensitive contraction (EC50 = 39-49 nM), and potentiated the EFS-induced contraction without affecting the responsiveness of acetylcholine. EM523 and GM611 (3-100 microM) contracted the proventriculus longitudinal muscle, and the maximum amplitudes of contraction were about 60% of that induced by chicken motilin. Chicken motilin (0.1 nM-100 nM) also caused contraction of the ileum (EC50 = 7 nM) through direct action on the smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, erythromycin derivatives showed only a weak contractile efficacy (about 20% of the maximum response of chicken motilin) even at high concentrations (10-100 microM). The rank order of potency in the ileum was chicken motilin > canine motilin > or = Leu13 porcine motilin > > GM611 > or = EM523 > or = EMA. GM109 slightly inhibited the ideal contractions induced by Leu13 porcine motilin at 100 microM (pA2 = 3.86). In the rabbit duodenum, chicken motilin was a full agonist with the same intrinsic activity as Leu13 porcine motilin, canine motilin and the erythromycin derivatives. However, the rank order of potency (Leu13 porcine motilin > or = canine motilin > chicken motilin > GM611 > or = EM523 > EMA) was different from that in the chicken ileum. In conclusion, chicken motilin causes an excitatory response in the chicken GI tract through activation of neural (proventriculus) and smooth muscle motilin receptors (ileum). The motilin receptor present in the ileum is different from that demonstrated in the rabbit intestine, because of a different rank order of motilin peptides in producing the contraction, low contracting activity of erythromycin derivatives and low antagonistic efficacy of GM109. Different pharmacological characteristics of the mechanical response induced by motilin peptides and erythromycin derivatives between the proventriculus and the ileum are discussed."
2017,27542489,A simple aptamer-based fluorescent assay for the detection of Aflatoxin B1 in infant rice cereal.,"A fluorescent assay for the rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was developed in this study. Initially, a DNA/DNA duplex was formed between a fluorescein-labeled AFB1 aptamer and its partially complementary DNA strand containing a quencher moiety, resulting in fluorescence quenching due to the close proximity of fluorophore and quencher. Upon the addition of AFB1, an aptamer/AFB1 complex was generated to release the quencher-modified DNA strand, thus recovered the fluorescence of fluorescein and enabled quantitative detection for AFB1 by monitoring fluorescence enhancement. Under optimized conditions, this assay exhibited a linear response to AFB1 in the range of 5-100ng/mL with a detection limit down to 1.6ng/mL. Trials of this assay in infant rice cereal with satisfactory recovery in the range of 93.0%-106.8%, demonstrate that the new assay could be a potential sensing platform for AFB1 determination in food.

1999,10510448,Curcumin inhibits Th1 cytokine profile in CD4+ T cells by suppressing interleukin-12 production in macrophages.,"1 Interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays a central role in the immune system by driving the immune response towards T helper 1 (Th1) type responses which are characterized by high IFN-gamma and low IL-4 production. In this study we investigated the effects of curcumin, a natural product of plants obtained from Curcuma longa (turmeric), on IL-12 production by mouse splenic macrophages and the subsequent ability of these cells to regulate cytokine production by CD4+ T cells. 2 Pretreatment with curcumin significantly inhibited IL-12 production by macrophages stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or head-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKL). 3 Curcumin-pretreated macrophages reduced their ability to induce IFN-gamma and increased the ability to induce IL-4 in Ag-primed CD4+ T cells. Addition of recombinant IL-12 to cultures of curcumin-pretreated macrophages and CD4+ T cells restored IFN-gamma production in CD4+ T cells. 4 The in vivo administration of curcumin resulted in the inhibition of IL-12 production by macrophages stimulated in vitro with either LPS or HKL, leading to the inhibition of Th1 cytokine profile (decreased IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 production) in CD4+ T cells. 5 These findings suggest that curcumin may inhibit Th1 cytokine profile in CD4+ T cells by suppressing IL-12 production in macrophages, and points to a possible therapeutic use of curcumin in the Th1-mediated immune diseases."
2004,15180865,"Etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin successfully cytoreduces resistant myeloma patients and mobilizes them for transplant without adverse effects.","Myeloma remains incurable with a median survival of 4 years, but outcome can be improved by the use of high-dose therapy. We used the etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin (ESHAP) regimen as second-line therapy in 42 newly diagnosed myeloma patients who had failed vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD)- type therapy (n = 36), responded to first-line treatment but persisted in having significant residual marrow plasmacytosis (n = 5) or failed prior stem cell harvesting (n = 1), with the dual aim of improving disease response and mobilizing peripheral blood stem cells. Fourteen of 21 (67%) patients with no change or progressive disease after VAD responded to ESHAP; seven of 12 (58%) patients with minor response converted to partial response. Marrow plasmacytosis fell from a median of 52% at diagnosis to 23.5% after primary therapy and to15% after ESHAP. ESHAP chemotherapy was well-tolerated. There were 11 admissions due to febrile neutropenia (n = 7), nausea and vomiting (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 1) and perforated bowel (n = 1). Renal function deteriorated in 13 of 42 patients after ESHAP, but none required renal support. ESHAP mobilization was performed in 32 patients of whom 87% achieved a CD34(+) yield >2 x 10(6)/kg. In all, 38 patients proceeded to high-dose therapy. The overall survival for all patients was 62% at 4 years following ESHAP. We conclude that ESHAP has acceptable toxicity and efficient stem cell mobilizing capability, effectively cytoreduced this chemoresistant group of patients, and did not appear to adversely affect transplant outcome."
2008,18365694,Modulation of the genomic estrogen receptor pathway by water extracts of Cirsium japonicum.,"We investigated the estrogenic activity of Cirsium japonicum water extracts, which have long been used to treat vascular-related diseases. The activity of the extracts was characterized in a transient transfection system, using estrogen receptor isoforms and estrogen-responsive luciferase plasmids in HEK 293 cells. The extract activated both and estrogen receptors. Activation was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, indicating that the effects were mediated through the estrogen receptor isoforms. Treatment with the extracts increased expression of the progesterone receptor and pS2 genes and expression of estrogen receptor was decreased in MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that the Cirsium japonicum water extracts showed estrogenic effects and may be a potential clinical application for treatment of estrogen related vascular diseases."
2019,30283148,Current use of biosimilar G-CSF for haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation.,"Despite biosimilars of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) filgrastim being approved by the European Medicines Agency since 2008, there is still some debate regarding their use in related and unrelated healthy haematopoietic stem cell donors. We present a review of published experiences using biosimilar filgrastim for healthy donor mobilisation as well as the results of a survey by the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) of its current use by register-associated transplant and collection centres for both related and unrelated donors. A total of 1287 healthy donors and volunteers are included in the reviewed studies. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies show a high degree of similarity to the reference product Neupogen. Mobilisation of CD34 + cells as well as reported adverse events are also found to be comparable, although there is still a lack of long-term follow up for both Neupogen and filgrastim biosimilars. No evidence is found of a higher risk of filgrastim antibody formation using filgrastim biosimilars. Based on this increased experience, the WMDA therefore recommend that Stem Cell Donor Registries can use filgrastim biosimilars for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells in healthy donors, provided that they are approved by national and/or regional agencies."
2010,21191759,Biological activities of Fructus arctii fermented with the basidiomycete Grifola frondosa.,"Fructus arctii extract containing phenolic glycosides was cultured with Grifola frondosa mycelia to produce β-glucosidase and its biological activities were studied. This β-glucosidase converted the glycosides (arctiin and caffeic acid derivatives) into aglycones (arctigenin and caffeic acid). Fermented Fructus arctii extract (G-FAE) with G. frondosa had antioxidant and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activities. The photoprotective potential of G-FAE was tested in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) exposed to ultra-violet A (UVA). It was revealed that G-FAE had an inhibitory effect on human interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-1) expression in UVA-irradiated HDF. The treatment of UVA-irradiated HDF with G-FAE resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression level of MMP-1 mRNA. G-FAE also showed notable stimulation of collagen biosynthetic activity for fibroblasts. These diverse functionalities suggest that G-FAE could be a promising cosmetic ingredient."
2018,29384041,Two G-box-like elements essential to high gene expression of SlAKR4B in tomato leaves.,"Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) play important roles in aldehyde detoxification as well as primary and secondary metabolism in plants. We previously reported inducible expression of a Solanum lycopersicum AKR4B (SlAKR4B) in tomato leaves treated with salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and high promoter activity of SlAKR4B in tomato leaf protoplasts. In this study, we investigated the expression response of SlAKR4B in the tomato leaves with infiltration treatment and the cis-element(s) involved in high promoter activity. Gene expression analysis in tomato leaf protoplasts and buffer-infiltrated tomato leaves suggested that cell damage caused the increased expression of SlAKR4B. Promoter activity of SlAKR4B was significantly reduced by mutation of two G-box like elements. It is suggested that the two G-box like elements are responsible for the high promoter activity."
2005,16256955,"Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 transcription by 6-(methylsulfinyl) hexyl isothiocyanate, a chemopreventive compound from Wasabia japonica (Miq.) Matsumura, in mouse macrophages.","6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC) is a chemopreventive compound occurring in Wasabi (Wasabia japonica (Miq.) Matsumura), which is a very popular pungent spice in Japan. We investigated the effects of 6-MITC on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophage RAW264 cells. Treatment with 6-MITC suppressed LPS-mediated induction of COX-2 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Transfections with various COX-2 promoter reporter constructs revealed that the inhibitory effects of 6-MITC on COX-2 gene expression were directed by the core promoter elements including nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) sites. Western blotting analysis showed that 6-MITC inhibited LPS-induced activation of MAPK (ERK, p38 kinase and JNK) and transcriptional factors (CREB, c-Jun and C/EBPdelta) binding the core elements of COX-2 promoter, substantiating the involvement of these signal transduction pathways in the regulation of COX-2 expression by 6-MITC. Moreover, Western blotting experiments with MAPK-specific inhibitors (U0126 for MEK1/2, SB203580 for p38 kinase and SP600125 for JNK) demonstrated that 6-MITC suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 expression by blocking the activation of JNK-mediated AP-1 and ERK/p38 kinase-mediated CREB or C/EBPdelta. Finally, the structure-activity study revealed that the inhibitory potency of methylsulfinyl isothiocyanates (MITCs) depended on the methyl chain length. These findings demonstrate for the first time that 6-MITC is an effective agent to attenuate COX-2 production, and enhance our understanding of the anti-inflammation properties of 6-MITC."
2016,26085057,Protective Effects of Combined Selenium and Punica granatum Treatment on Some Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Markers in Arsenic-Induced Hepatotoxicity in Rats.,"Oxidative stress is one of the major mechanisms implicated in inorganic arsenic poisoning. Punica granatum is known by its free radical scavenging properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of combined selenium and P. granatum against arsenic-induced liver injury. Seventy-five female albino rats were divided into five groups (of 15 rats each). Toxicity was induced by oral sodium arsenite (5.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) daily) (group ІІ). Treatment of arsenic-intoxicated rats was induced by daily oral administration of sodium selenite (3 mg/kg bw) (group ІІІ), 100 mg of P. granatum ethanol extract per kilogram body weight dissolved in 300 mL distilled water in three divided doses (100 mL of this suspension every 8 h) (group IV), and combined daily oral treatment with both selenite and P. granatum ethanol extract (group V). After 3 weeks, serum and liver tissues were obtained from the decapitated rats for different estimations. Hepatotoxicity was demonstrated by significant elevation in liver weights and activities of liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and decrease in serum total proteins and albumin (p < 0.05) which were confirmed by histopathological examination. Additionally, arsenic hepatotoxicity led to an increased values of malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, nitric oxide, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p < 0.05) and decreased activity of thioredoxin reductase, values of total anti-oxidant capacity, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expression. Significant improvement in all assessed parameters was observed in rat group treated with both P. granatum and selenium. It was concluded that combined P. granatum and selenium treatment had a synergistic hepatoprotective effect against arsenic toxicity through activation of Nrf2 anti-oxidant pathway. "
2009,19133991,A standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba suppresses doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress and p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in rat testes.,"Doxorubicin evokes oxidative stress and precipitates cell apoptosis in testicular tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the Ginkgo biloba extract 761 (EGb), a widely used herbal medicine with potent anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, could protect testes from such doxorubicin injury.Sprague-Dawley male rats (8 weeks old) were given vehicle, doxorubicin alone (3 mg kg(-1) every 2 days for three doses), EGb alone (5 mg kg(-1) every 2 days for three doses), or EGb followed by doxorubicin (each dose administered 1 day after EGb). At 7 days after the first drug treatment oxidative and apoptotic testicular toxicity was evaluated by biochemical, histological and flow cytometric analyses.Compared with controls, testes from doxorubicin-treated rats displayed impaired spermatogenesis, depleted haploid germ cell subpopulations, increased lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde), depressed antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione), reduced antioxidant enzyme expression (superoxide dismutase) and elevated apoptotic indexes (pro-apoptotic modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, intensification of p53 and Apaf-1, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 and increase of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labelling/sub-haploid cells), while EGb pretreatment effectively alleviated all of these doxorubicin-induced abnormalities in testes.These results demonstrate that EGb protected against the oxidative and apoptotic actions of doxorubicin on testes. EGb may be a promising adjuvant therapy medicine, potentially ameliorating testicular toxicity of this anti-neoplastic agent in clinical practice."
2012,23442611,The effects of host defence elicitors on betacyanin accumulation in Amaranthus mangostanus seedlings.,"The effect of elicitors associated with host defence on betacyanin accumulation in Amaranthus mangostanus seedlings was investigated. Under the conditions of the experiments, betacyanin accumulation was generally enhanced by light. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased betacyanin synthesis in a concentration-dependent response. Seedlings treated with ethylene as 5mM Ethephon also had elevated levels of betacyanin. In contrast, salicylic acid (SA) and H(2)O(2) treatments had no influence on betacyanin contents in light or dark. Combined MeJA with Ethephon or H(2)O(2) had an additive effect on betacyanin accumulation in dark-grown seedlings. However, a decline was recorded in light-grown seedlings. Moreover, an antagonistic effect on betacyanin synthesis was found when MeJA and SA were added simultaneously. Our results indicate that betacyanin content in A. mangostanus seedlings can be upregulated by MeJA and ethylene. Both additive and antagonistic effects in regulating betacyanin synthesis in A. mangostanus seedlings were observed between MeJA and other elicitors."
2013,23470964,Molecular pathways: Inhibiting steroid biosynthesis in prostate cancer.,"A significant proportion of castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) remains driven by ligand activation of the androgen receptor. Although the testes are the primary source of testosterone, testosterone can also be produced from peripheral conversion of adrenal sex hormone precursors DHEA and androstenedione in the prostate and other tissues. CYP17A1 catalyzes two essential reactions in the production of DHEA and androstenedione: the hydroxylation (hydroxylase activity) and the subsequent cleavage of the C17-20 side chain (lyase activity). Potent and selective inhibition of CYP17A1 by abiraterone depletes residual nongonadal androgens and is an effective treatment for CRPC. Elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie resistance to abiraterone will inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies post-abiraterone. Preclinical evidence that androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer cells does not necessarily follow a single dominant pathway, and residual androgens or alternative ligands (including administered glucocorticoids) can reactivate androgen receptor signaling, supports cotargeting of more than one enzyme involved in steroidogenesis and combining a CYP17A1 inhibitor with an antiandrogen. Furthermore, given the drawbacks of 17α-hydroxylase inhibition, there is considerable interest in developing new CYP17A1 inhibitors that more specifically inhibit lyase activity and are therefore less likely to require glucocorticoid coadministration."
,26084642,[Effectiveness of phytotherapy in supportive treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus Billberry (Vaccinium myrtillus)].,"The billberry is well-known for its tasty blue-dyeing fruits. Historically the leaves and fruits were used to treat diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dementia and cancer. Antidiabetic properties of the plant are attributed mostly to the content of anthocyanins and polyphenols. These compounds have proven their antidiabetic potential in various studies. Their mechanism of action is an increase in insulin secretion (anthocyanin pelargonidin), reduction of insulin resistance (anthocyanin cyanidin-3-glucoside), glucose resorption from the GIT (polyphenols) and enhancement of beta-cells regeneration. Besides these effects, anthocyanins contribute to the improvement of the lipid spectrum and have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activities. Antidiabetic effects of anthocyanin cyanidin-3-galactoside were compared to acarbose (synergistic effect), hypocholesterolemic activity of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside to atorvastatin (synergistic effect) and hypolipidemic properties of blueberry leaf extract to ciprofibrate (extract has a lower effect). However, in many preclinical and clinical studies different species of the Vaccinium genus and other plants with asimilar effect as the billberry were also assessed. Therefore, in order to convincingly assess the efficacy and safety of blueberry herbal medicines more studies are necessary. Such studies should shed light into the variety of anthocyanins, their particular effects and optimal doses and compare their effects with intake of foods generally rich in anthocyanins.Key words: billberry Vaccinium myrtillus diabetes mellitus phytotherapy antocyanines.

2012,23043630,"Protective effects of Sonchus asper (L.) Hill, (Asteraceae) against CCl(4-)induced oxidative stress in the thyroid tissue of rats.","Sonchus asper (L.) Hill, (Asteraceae) is used in Pakistan as a traditional (""folk"") medicine for the treatment of hormonal disorders and oxidative stress. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Sonchus asper (L.) Hill, (Asteraceae) methanolic extract (SAME) on hormonal dysfunction in thyroid tissue after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress.To examine the effects of SAME against the oxidative stress of CCl4 in thyroid tissue, 30 male albino rats were used. Protective effects of SAME were observed on thyroid hormonal levels, activities of antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and DNA damage.Treatment with CCl4 significantly (P<0.01) reduced the levels of T3 and T4 and increased TSH levels. CCl4 exposure in rats reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes but increased lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Co-administration of SAME significantly (P<0.01) improved these alterations with respect to hormonal levels, activities of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation close to those seen in control rats.These results suggest that SAME can protect thyroid tissue against oxidative damage, possibly through the antioxidant effects of its bioactive compounds."
2009,20443159,Fighting cancer with red wine? Molecular mechanisms of resveratrol.,"Resveratrol, a red wine constituent, has been known for its cardioprotective effects. Recent data give ample evidence that resveratrol can act as a chemopreventive agent as well. Tumor initation, promotion, and progression are affected by resveratrol via multiple pathways, which are discussed in this review. Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory effects by counteracting NF-kappa B and AP-1 transcription and can prevent bioactivation of procarcinogens by interacting with drug metabolizing enzymes. Furthermore, resveratrol exerts antioxidant activities, hence contributing to the prevention of tumor initiation. Growing or metastasizing carcinomas are inhibited by resveratrol through prevention of angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF and matrix metalloproteases. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, important mechanisms for cancer therapy, are stimulated by resveratrol through different mechanisms, e.g., activation of p53 and modulation of cell cycle proteins. Although there has been remarkable evidence for resveratrol as a potent chemopreventive agent in vitro, it seems that the low bioavailability of resveratrol in humans could interfere with a successful in vivo treatment. Nevertheless, resveratrol offers two major advantages over conventional chemotherapy. The cytotoxic effects of resveratrol on healthy cells can be neglected, and, as several pathways leading to chemotherapeutic effects are activated by resveratrol, chemoresistance-inducing mutations in cancer cells can be overcome."
2018,30044661,Support of bone mineral deposition by regulation of pH.,"Osteoblasts secrete collagen and isolate bone matrix from extracellular space. In the matrix, alkaline phosphatase generates phosphate that combines with calcium to form mineral, liberating 8 H+ per 10 Ca+2 deposited. However, pH-dependent hydroxyapatite deposition on bone collagen had not been shown. We studied the dependency of hydroxyapatite deposition on type I collagen on pH and phosphate by surface plasmon resonance in 0-5 mM phosphate at pH 6.8-7.4. Mineral deposition saturated at <1 mM Ca2+ but was sensitive to phosphate. Mineral deposition was reversible, consistent with amorphous precipitation; stable deposition requiring EDTA removal appeared with time. At pH 6.8, little hydroxyapatite deposited on collagen; mineral accumulation increased 10-fold at pH 7.4. Previously, we showed high expression Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and ClC transporters in osteoblasts. We hypothesized that, in combination, these move protons across osteoblasts to the general extracellular space. We made osteoblast membrane vesicles by nitrogen cavitation and used acridine orange quenching to characterize proton transport. We found H+ transport dependent on gradients of chloride or sodium, consistent with apical osteoblast ClC family Cl-,H+ antiporters and basolateral osteoblast NHE family Na+/H+ exchangers. Little, if any, active H+ transport, supported by ATP, occurred. Major transporters include cariporide-sensitive NHE1 in basolateral membranes and ClC3 and ClC5 in apical osteoblast membranes. The mineralization inhibitor levamisole reduced bone formation and expression of alkaline phosphatase, NHE1, and ClC5. We conclude that mineral deposition in bone collagen is pH-dependent, in keeping with H+ removal by Cl-,H+ antiporters and Na+/H+-exchangers. Periodic orientation hydroxyapatite is organized on type I collagen-coiled coils."
2014,23963976,Antithrombotic activities of oroxylin A in vitro and in vivo.,"Here, the anticoagulant activities of oroxylin A (OroA), a major component of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, were examined by monitoring activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and the activities of cell-based thrombin and activated factor X (FXa). Furthermore, the effects of OroA on the expressions of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were tested in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treatment with OroA resulted in prolonged aPTT and PT and inhibition of the activities of thrombin and FXa, and OroA inhibited production of thrombin and FXa in HUVECs. And OroA inhibited thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization and platelet aggregation. In accordance with these anticoagulant activities, OroA elicited anticoagulant effects in mouse. In addition, treatment of OroA resulted in the inhibition of TNF-α-induced production of PAI-1, and treatment with OroA resulted in the significant reduction of the PAI-1 to t-PA ratio. Collectively, OroA possess antithrombotic activities and offer bases for development of a novel anticoagulant."
2013,23813426,Manganese-induced effects on cerebral trace element and nitric oxide of Hyline cocks.,"Exposure to Manganese (Mn) is a common phenomenon due to its environmental pervasiveness. To investigate the Mn-induced toxicity on cerebral trace element levels and crucial nitric oxide parameters on brain of birds, 50-day-old male Hyline cocks were fed either a commercial diet or a Mn-supplemented diet containing 600, 900, 1,800 mg kg(-1). After being treated with Mn for 30, 60, and 90 days, the following were determined: the changes in contents of copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), selenium (Se) in brain; inducible nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide (iNOS-NO) system activity in brain; and histopathology and ultrastructure changes of cerebral cortex. The results showed that Mn was accumulated in brain and the content of Cu and Fe increased. However, the levels of Zn and Se decreased and the Ca content presented no obvious regularity. Exposure to Mn significantly elevated the content of NO and the expression of iNOS mRNA. Activity of total NO synthase (T NOS) and iNOS appeared with an increased tendency. These findings suggested that Mn exposure resulted in the imbalance of cerebral trace elements and influenced iNOS in the molecular level, which are possible underlying nervous system injury mechanisms induced by Mn exposure."
2014,24568333,Production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in jasmonic acid-induced red clover suspension cultures.,"Effect of exogenously applied jasmonic acid (JA) in combination with calcium and verapamil (a calcium channels blocker) on the production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in suspension cultures of Trifolium pratense L. was investigated. The culture was cultivated in Gamborg medium with an addition of 2 mg.l(-1) of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2 mg.l(-1) of 6-benzylaminopurine, at the temperature of 25 °C, 16-hr light/8-hr dark period. The best effect of jasmonic acid on the production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids was manifested after a 24-hour application of the 50 μmol.l(-1) concentration. The maximum production of JA-induced suspension culture was observed when cells were treated with a high level of calcium (10 mmol.l(-1)). The addition of all concentrations of verapamil to JA-induced suspension culture decreased production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids."
2015,26167536,"Variations in Hormones and Antioxidant Status in Relation to Flowering in Early, Mid, and Late Varieties of Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) of United Arab Emirates.","The present study was carried out to assess the status of various hormones responsible for the flower induction of Nagal, Lulu, and Khalas date palm varieties in UAE. The nonenzymatic antioxidant compounds and the antioxidant enzymatic activities at preflowering, flowering, and postflowering stages of the date palm varieties were quantified. The ABA and zeatin concentrations were found to be significantly higher during the preflowering stage but gradually decreased during the flowering period and then increased after the flowering stage. Gibberellic acid (GA) concentrations were significantly higher in the early flowering varieties and higher levels of ABA may contribute to the delayed flowering in mid and late varieties. The results on hormone profiling displayed a significant variation between seasons (preflowering, flowering, and postflowering) and also between the three date palms (early, mid, and late flowering varieties). Ascorbic acid (AA) concentration was low at the preflowering stage in the early flowering Nagal (0.694 mg/g dw), which is similar with the late flowering Lulu variety (0.862 mg/g dw). However, Khalas variety showed significantly higher amount of AA content (7.494 mg/g dw) at the preflowering stage when compared to other varieties. In flowering stage, Nagal (0.814 mg/g dw) and Lulu (0.963 mg/g dw) were similar with respect to the production of AA, while the mid flowering variety showed significantly higher amount of AA (9.358 mg/g dw). The Khalas variety produced the highest tocopherol at 4.78 mg/g dw compared to Nagal and Lulu, at 1.997 and 1.908 mg/g dw, respectively, during the preflowering stage. In Nagal variety, the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) at the preflowering stage was 0.507 mg/g dw, which was not significantly different from the flowering and postflowering stages at 0.4 and 0.45 mg/g dw, respectively. The GSH was significantly higher in Khalas compared to Nagal and Lulu varieties, at 1.321 mg/g w in the preflowering phase followed by 3.347 mg/g dw and 2.349 mg/g dw at the flowering and postflowering phases, respectively. Catalase activity increased with different stages of growth. The lowest catalase activity was observed at the preflowering stage in Khalas (0.116), with similar observations noted during flowering (0.110) and postflowering stage. This study provides an insight into the possible roles of endogenous hormones and antioxidants and in the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the regulation of flower development in date palm varieties."
2015,25541467,Curcumin is a tight-binding inhibitor of the most efficient human daunorubicin reductase--Carbonyl reductase 1.,"Curcumin is a major component of the plant Curcuma longa L. It is traditionally used as a spice and coloring in foods and is an important ingredient in curry. Curcuminoids have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and gained increasing attention as potential neuroprotective and cancer preventive compounds. In the present study, we report that curcumin is a potent tight-binding inhibitor of human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, Ki=223 nM). Curcumin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate 2,3-hexandione as revealed by plotting IC50-values against various substrate concentrations and most likely as a competitive inhibitor with respect to NADPH. Molecular modeling supports the finding that curcumin occupies the cofactor binding site of CBR1. Interestingly, CBR1 is one of the most effective human reductases in converting the anthracycline anti-tumor drug daunorubicin to daunorubicinol. The secondary alcohol metabolite daunorubicinol has significantly reduced anti-tumor activity and shows increased cardiotoxicity, thereby limiting the clinical use of daunorubicin. Thus, inhibition of CBR1 may increase the efficacy of daunorubicin in cancer tissue and simultaneously decrease its cardiotoxicity. Western-blots demonstrated basal expression of CBR1 in several cell lines. Significantly less daunorubicin reduction was detected after incubating A549 cell lysates with increasing concentrations of curcumin (up to 60% less with 50 μM curcumin), suggesting a beneficial effect in the co-treatment of anthracycline anti-tumor drugs together with curcumin."
2013,23601402,Voluntary food fortification with folic acid in Spain: predicted contribution to children's dietary intakes as assessed with new food folate composition data.,"The Spanish market offers a significant number of folic acid (FA) voluntarily fortified foods. We analysed FA and (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid ((6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu) content in ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) (n=68) and cow's milk (n=25) by a previously validated affinity chromatography-HPLC method. Contribution to potential FA intakes for children aged 2-13years, was assessed using food consumption data from a representative nationwide study, folate Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDI), and Upper Levels (UL). Results showed that at all food fortification levels obtained, fortified products provided more than tenfold FA than (6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu. For RTEC, the high fortification level provided 6-21%, per serving, of RDI and ⩽32% of ULs at 90th percentile of RTEC consumption (P90). Milk products fortified at the higher level reached on average 54-136% of RDI per serving and only exceeded UL at P90 of milk consumption in children aged 2-5years."
2012,23102375,Effects of ginsenoside Re on LPS-induced inflammatory mediators in BV2 microglial cells.,"Microglial activation plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases by producing several pro-inflammatory enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation leads to the activation of microglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD, and ALS. Ginseng is a natural antioxidant used in herbal medicine and contains ginsenosides (Rb1, Rg1, Rg3, Re, and Rd), which have anti-neoplastic and anti-stress properties.This study demonstrates the involvement of the anti-inflammatory signaling pathway, ginsenoside-Re (G-Re), which is one of the ginsenosides mediated by LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial cells.BV2 microglial cells were pretreated with 2 μg/ml G-Re and stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS to induce neuroinflammation. To investigate the effect of G-Re on LPS-induced cell signaling, we performed western blotting and immunofluorescence using specific antibodies, such as phospho-p38, COX2, and iNOS.Pretreatment with 2 μg/ml G-Re was neuroprotective against 1 μg/ml LPS-treated microglial cells. The neuroprotective events induced by G-Re treatment in neuroinflammation occurred via the phospho-p38, iNOS, and COX2 signaling pathways in BV2 cells.Taken together, we suggest that G-Re exerts a beneficial effect on neuroinflammatory events in neurodegenerative diseases."
2015,26088000,Ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and suppressed protein aggregations caused by hyperhomocysteinemia.,"Homocysteine (Hcy) has been proposed to be a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. We investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of action of propolis, which has antioxidant activity on Hcy-induced oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro assays, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and glioblastoma U-251MG cells were cultured with Hcy and various concentrations of propolis. Cell death and reactive oxygen species production were significantly suppressed by propolis in dose-dependent manner, compared with Hcy alone. For the in vivo assays, mice were fed a propolis-containing diet and Hcy thiolactone in water. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze test. Propolis suppressed cognitive dysfunction caused by hyperhomocysteinemia. Accumulation of aggregated protein in brain was accelerated in hyperhomocysteinemia, and the accumulation was suppressed by propolis. Hyperhomocysteinemia, however, did not enhance the oxidative stress in brain. In vitro amyloid formation assay showed that Hcy accelerated lysozyme aggregation and propolis inhibited the aggregation.

2017,28922724,Oyster (Ostrea plicatula Gmelin) polysaccharides intervention ameliorates cyclophosphamide-Induced genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in mice via the Nrf2-ARE pathway.,"In this study, we explored the protective effects of oyster (Ostrea plicatula Gmelin) polysaccharides (OPS) against genotoxicity and liver injury induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) in BALB/c mice. OPS was administered to mice at doses of 100 and 200mg/kg for 7 consecutive days, then 50mg/kg CP was injected via abdomen. Then mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Bone marrow micronuclei (MN) and polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE): normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) ratio were calculated to evaluate CP induced genetic toxicity. Activites of transaminase and antioxidants in serum as well as liver histopathology were examined to assess the severity of liver damage. We further investigate the molecular mechanism by Western blot analysis. When CP induced group pretreated with OPS, the generation of MN was obviously reduced accompanying by the restoration of PCE: NCE ratio. We also found that pretreatment of mice with OPS markedly reduced the release of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST). Histological examination and grading evaluation also showed that OPS could significantly attenuated CP-induced liver damage. At the same time, OPS supplementation attenuated CP-induced oxidative stress as evident by the alternation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Furthermore, CP induced mice showed the downregulation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2 - related factor 2) - ARE (antioxidant response element) and the downstream genes i.e. NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO - 1) and Hemoxygenase-1 (HO - 1), which were obviously reversed by OPS pretreatment. In conclusion, OPS protects against the genotoxicity and hepatotoxicity induced by CP in vivo. The beneficial effect may depend on activation of Nrf2 - ARE pathway and subsequent suppression of oxidative stress and genetic toxicity."
2000,10737198,Cloning and expression of the Momordica charantia trypsin inhibitor II gene in silkworm by using a baculovirus vector.,"MCTI-II (Momordica charantia trypsin inhibitor II) isolated from bitter gourd (Momordica charantia LINN.) seeds is one of the serine protease inhibitors of the squash family. We cloned cDNA that encodes MCTI-II and constructed an expression system for MCTI-II by using a baculovirus vector. The recombinant baculovirus was inoculated to early fifth-instar larvae of the silkworm (strain: Shunrei x Shougetsu). Four days after infection, the hemolymph of silkworm larvae was collected and the recombinant protein was purified. Two kinds of expressed MCTI-II protein were obtained. An amino acid sequence analysis of the two proteins indicates that both were similar to the authentic inhibitor, except for the addition of a tripeptide derived from the vector at the N-terminus. One of the two inhibitors (MCTI-II A) resulted in a single PTH-amino acid in each Edman degradation cycle, while the other (MCTI-II B) resulted in two PTH-amino acids, suggesting the occurrence of cleavage of the reactive site. The inhibitory activities of MCTI-II expressed toward trypsin are examined in terms of the Ki value, these being 6.4 x 10(-10)M for MCTI-II A and 5.2 x 10(-10) M for MCTI-II B."
2015,25722174,"Polyphenols content, phenolics profile and antioxidant activity of organic red wines produced without sulfur dioxide/sulfites addition in comparison to conventional red wines.","Wine exerts beneficial effects on human health when it is drunk with moderation. Nevertheless, wine may also contain components negatively affecting human health. Among these, sulfites may induce adverse effects after ingestion. We examined total polyphenols and flavonoids content, phenolics profile and antioxidant activity of eight organic red wines produced without sulfur dioxide/sulfites addition in comparison to those of eight conventional red wines. Polyphenols and flavonoids content were slightly higher in organic wines in respect to conventional wines, however differences did not reach statistical significance. The phenolic acids profile was quite similar in both groups of wines. Antioxidant activity was higher in organic wines compared to conventional wines, although differences were not statistically significant. Our results indicate that organic red wines produced without sulfur dioxide/sulfites addition are comparable to conventional red wines with regard to the total polyphenols and flavonoids content, the phenolics profile and the antioxidant activity.

2007,17876860,Inhibitory effects of various beverages on human recombinant sulfotransferase isoforms SULT1A1 and SULT1A3.,"Sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 and SULT1A3 play important roles in the presystemic inactivation of beta(2) agonists in the liver and intestine, respectively. The study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of grapefruit juice, orange juice, green tea, black tea and oolong tea and their constituents on the activities of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. The activities of both SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 were significantly inhibited by all the beverages investigated at a concentration of 10%. The beverage constituents were tested in concentration ranges considered to be physiologically relevant. The grapefruit constituent, quercetin, completely inhibited SULT1A1, while quercetin and naringin both partially inhibited SULT1A3. The orange constituents, tangeretin and nobiletin, also completely inhibited SULT1A1. The tea constituents, (-)-epicatechin gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, both almost completely inhibited SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. Moreover, the theaflavin and thearubigin fractions of black tea both completely inhibited SULT1A1 and strongly inhibited SULT1A3. The inhibitory action of green tea on SULT1A3 was competitive, while that of black tea and oolong tea was mixed competitive/non-competitive. Mechanism-based inhibition was not observed with any beverage. In conclusion, various beverages, especially teas, inhibit the function of SULT1A3, and therefore may have the potential to increase the bioavailability of orally administered substrates of SULT1A3, such as beta(2) agonists."
2011,21820420,Lycium barbarum (Goji Berry) extracts and its taurine component inhibit PPAR-γ-dependent gene transcription in human retinal pigment epithelial cells: Possible implications for diabetic retinopathy treatment.,"The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a preventable microvascular diabetic complication that damages human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Taurine is abundant in the fruit of Lycium barbarum (Goji Berry), and is reportedly beneficial for diabetic retinopathy. However, the mechanism of its action is unknown. Hence, we have investigated the mechanism of action of an extract from L. barbarum on a model of diabetic retinopathy, the retinal ARPE-19 cell line, and identified the receptor function of taurine, an active component of L. barbarum (Goji Berry) extract, which is potentially responsible for the protective effect on diabetic retinopathy. We demonstrate for the first time that L. barbarum extract and its taurine component dose-dependently enhance PPAR-γ luciferase activity in HEK293 cell line transfected with PPAR-γ reporter gene. This activity was significantly decreased by a selective PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. Moreover, L. barbarum extract and taurine dose-dependently enhanced the expression of PPAR-γ mRNA and protein. In an inflammation model where ARPE-19 cells were exposed to high glucose L. barbarum extract and taurine down-regulated the mRNA of pro-inflammatory mediators encoding MMP-9, fibronectin and the protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS proteins. The predicted binding mode of taurine in the PPAR-γ ligand binding site mimics key electrostatic interactions seen with known PPAR-γ agonists. We conclude that PPAR-γ activation by L. barbarum extract is associated with its taurine content and may explain at least in part its use in diabetic retinopathy progression."
2013,23973647,Mechanisms underlying the antinociceptive effect of mangiferin in the formalin test.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible antinociceptive effect of mangiferin, a glucosylxanthone present in Mangifera indica L., in inflammatory pain. Furthermore, we sought to investigate the possible mechanisms action that contributes to these effects. The ipsilateral local peripheral (1-30 µg/paw), intrathecal (1-30 µg/rat) and oral (1-30 mg/kg) administration of mangiferin produced a dose-dependent reduction in formalin-induced nociception. The antinociceptive effect of this drug was similar to that induced by diclofenac after oral and local peripheral administration. Furthermore, mangiferin was also able to reduce 0.1% capsaicin- and serotonin-induced nociceptive behavior. The local peripheral antinociceptive effect of mangiferin in the formalin test was blocked by naloxone (50 μg/paw), naltrindole (1 μg/paw), 5-guanidinonaltrindole (5-GNTI, 1 μg/paw), N(G)-L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 µg/paw), 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo [4,2-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 50 µg/paw) and glibenclamide (50 μg/paw), but not by methiothepin (30 μg/paw). These results suggest that the antinociceptive effects induced by mangiferin are mediated by the peripheral opioidergic system involving the activation of δ, κ, and probably µ, receptors, but not serotonergic receptors. Data also suggests that mangiferin activates the NO-cyclic GMP-ATP-sensitive K(+) channels pathway in order to produce its local peripheral antinociceptive effect in the formalin test. Mangiferin may prove to be effective in treating inflammatory pain in humans."
2015,25851149,"Urinary iodine level and its determinants in pregnant women of Shanghai, China.","It is known that iodine deficiency during pregnancy can interfere with normal fetal growth and development. However, iodine levels of pregnant women in Shanghai, China, and factors that could influence its levels remain unclear. A total of 916 pregnant women were selected from the Maternal and Child Care Service Centre of Minhang District in Shanghai. Morning urinary iodine (UI) and iodine content of salt from the participants' home were measured, and UI concentration was adjusted by creatinine concentrations. Serum tri-iodothyronine, thyroxin, free tri-iodothyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone were tested in the second trimester of pregnancy by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. The median levels of UI in pregnant women were 156.3, 176.9 and 175.1 μg/g creatinine in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. The prevalence of UI deficiency (UI < 150 μg/g creatinine) was 48.3, 34.2 and 36.2% in the three trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. Factors that significantly influenced the UI levels include the following: iodine content of household salt; age; occupation; multivitamin supplement with iodine; seaweed intakes. Furthermore, UI and iodine content of salt were moderately correlated (r 0.406, P < 0.001). In addition, there was no significant association between UI and thyroid hormone levels. The present study showed a high prevalence of UI deficiency in pregnant women in Shanghai, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. Both iodine content of household salt and multivitamin supplement with iodine are the main determinants of UI levels in Shanghai."
2011,21963506,Coffee induces breast cancer resistance protein expression in Caco-2 cells.,"Coffee is a beverage that is consumed world-wide on a daily basis and is known to induce a series of metabolic and pharmacological effects, especially in the digestive tract. However, little is known concerning the effects of coffee on transporters in the gastrointestinal tract. To elucidate the effect of coffee on intestinal transporters, we investigated its effect on expression of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) in a human colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2. Coffee induced BCRP gene expression in Caco-2 cells in a coffee-dose dependent manner. Coffee treatment of Caco-2 cells also increased the level of BCRP protein, which corresponded to induction of gene expression, and also increased cellular efflux activity, as judged by Hoechst33342 accumulation. None of the major constituents of coffee tested could induce BCRP gene expression. The constituent of coffee that mediated this induction was extractable with ethyl acetate and was produced during the roasting process. Dehydromethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), an inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, inhibited coffee-mediated induction of BCRP gene expression, suggesting involvement of NF-κB in this induction. Our data suggest that daily consumption of coffee might induce BCRP expression in the gastrointestinal tract and may affect the bioavailability of BCRP substrates."
2007,17409507,Effect of Tremella fuciformis on the neurite outgrowth of PC12h cells and the improvement of memory in rats.,"We investigated the neuritogenic effects of Tremella fuciformis (TF), which has been valued in traditional Chinese medicine as a remedy with nutritive and tonic actions, on PC12h cells. The cognitive improving effects of TF on scopolamine-induced (2 mg/kg, s.c.) amnesia in rats were also evaluated with using the Morris water maze task and by performing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. The water extract of TF (0.01-1 microg/ml) promoted neurite outgrowth of the PC12h cells in a dose dependent manner. TF was highly efficient at the concentration range of 0.1-1 microg/ml. Oral daily treatment with TF (100 or 400 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced deficit in learning and memory, and it alleviated decrease in cholinergic immunoreactivity induced by scopolamine in the medial septum and hippocampus. The results demonstrate that the promotion of neuritogenesis in neuronal culture cells by TF water extract is related with its activity for improving the performance of rats on a spatial learning and memory task. Moreover, the impairments of spatial learning and memory may be attributable to the decrease in activation of the septohippocampal cholinergic system and that TF ameliorated learning and memory deficits partly through its increasing the central cholinergic activity. Therefore, TF could represent a potentially useful agent that is able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes."
2001,11502555,Mechanism of thiamine uptake by human jejunal brush-border membrane vesicles.,"Thiamine, a water-soluble vitamin, is essential for normal cellular functions, growth and development. Thiamine deficiency leads to significant clinical problems and occurs under a variety of conditions. To date, however, little is known about the mechanism of thiamine absorption in the native human small intestine. The objective of this study was, therefore, to characterize the mechanism of thiamine transport across the brush-border membrane (BBM) of human small intestine. With the use of purified BBM vesicles (BBMV) isolated from the jejunum of organ donors, thiamine uptake was found to be 1) independent of Na(+) but markedly stimulated by an outwardly directed H(+) gradient (pH 5.5(in)/pH 7.5(out)); 2) competitively inhibited by the cation transport inhibitor amiloride (inhibitor constant of 0.12 mM); 3) sensitive to temperature and osmolarity of the incubation medium; 4) significantly inhibited by thiamine structural analogs (amprolium, oxythiamine, and pyrithiamine), but not by unrelated organic cations (tetraethylammonium, N-methylnicotinamide, or choline); 5) not affected by the addition of ATP to the inside and outside of the BBMV; 6) potential insensitive; and 7) saturable as a function of thiamine concentration with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.61 +/- 0.08 microM and a maximal velocity of 1.00 +/- 0.47 pmol. mg protein(-1). 10 s(-1). Carrier-mediated thiamine uptake was also found in BBMV of human ileum. These data demonstrate the existence of a Na(+)-independent, pH-dependent, amiloride-sensitive, electroneutral carrier-mediated mechanism for thiamine absorption in native human small intestinal BBMV."
2017,28458161,Total sesquiterpene glycosides from Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) leaf alleviate high-fat diet induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through cytochrome P450 2E1 inhibition.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease characterized by hepatic steatosis, which affects 20-40% of the population in the world. Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) Leaf possesses several pharmacological actions. Many sesquiterpene glycosides were reported to be isolated exclusively from the Loquat Leaf, however, their biological activity has been rarely investigated. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of total sesquiterpene glycosides (TSG) in high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD mice with its related mechanisms of action. Mice were fed with a normal diet or HFD for 8 weeks. TSG (25 and 100mg/kg/day), simvastatin (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle were orally administered for last 4 weeks of the 8-week HFD feeding period. From the result, it was showed that TSG significantly reduced the body weight and fat deposition in the liver of NAFLD mice. It also decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) contents in the serum. Compared with NAFLD mice, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were increased and decreased after the administration of TSG in a dose of 100mg/kg, respectively. TSG reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity as well. Finally, TSG was found to suppress the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the phosphorylation of c-jun terminal kinase (JNK) in NAFLD mice. In summary, this study demonstrates that TSG reduces oxidative stress by downregulating of CYP2E1 expression and JNK phosphorylation in NAFLD, and alleviates NAFLD ultimately. TSG potentially serves as bioactive compounds for the treatment of NAFLD."
2018,28111973,"Efficacy of crocin and safranal as protective agents against genotoxic stress induced by gamma radiation, urethane and procarbazine in mice.","Crocin (CRO) and safranal (SAF) are bioactive constituents of saffron (dried stigma of Crocus sativus flower), an expensive spice with medicinal properties. Aqueous extract of saffron is known for its antigenotoxic effect against environmental genotoxins/carcinogens. However, there is need to identify saffron constituents responsible for this antigenotoxic effect. The aim of our investigation was to ascertain the role of CRO and SAF as inhibitors of in vivo genotoxic stress. For this purpose, Swiss albino mice were pretreated with CRO (50-mg/kg body weight (bw))/SAF (0.025- and 0.25-ml/kg bw) by gavage for 2 days. Thereafter, the pretreated mice were exposed to the genotoxic agents: (1) gamma radiation (GR; 2 Gy), (2) urethane (URE; 800 mg/kg) and (3) procarbazine (PCB; 60 mg/kg). In addition, CRO (50 mg/kg) was co-administered with the nitrosation reaction mixture of methylurea (MU; 300-mg/kg bw) + sodium nitrite (15 mg/kg) which can form N-nitroso-N-MU in the stomach. Genotoxic damage was measured by performing the bone marrow micronucleus test. Results obtained demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of mice pretreated with CRO/SAF before exposure to the above DNA damaging agents, GR, URE and PCB. Co-administration of CRO with the nitrosation reaction mixture led to significant decrease in genotoxicity when compared to nitrosation reaction mixture alone. Histopathological studies revealed that these saffron constituents reduced testicular cell damage induced by the test genotoxins. The cell-free DNA-nicking assay using pBR322 DNA showed significant protective effects of CRO against hydroxyl radical-induced strand breaks."
2001,11722425,A comparison of the efficacy and rate of response to oral and intravenous Vitamin K in reversal of over-anticoagulation with warfarin.,"The role of oral Vitamin K administration in the reversal of anticoagulation is not yet clear because of a paucity of data on the early effects of treatment, apparent differences in efficacy between preparations and a lack of data comparing oral with intravenous administration. We have compared the effects on the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activities of the Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X at 4 h and 24 h after administration of three oral Vitamin K preparations and of intravenous Vitamin K in 64 anticoagulated patients who required non-urgent partial correction of anticoagulation. Our data confirm that correction of anticoagulation is more rapid after intravenous administration of Vitamin K than after oral administration of similar or larger doses. At 24 h, satisfactory correction of INR can be achieved using low-dose Vitamin K given by either the intravenous or oral route. Our data, and that from previous studies, suggest that there may be differences in efficacy between orally administered products. Administration of Vitamin K by either route was accompanied by changes in the activities of the Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors that reflected their respective biological half-lives. In the 24 h after treatment, the relationship between the INR and the individual Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors was similar to that described previously in stable anticoagulated patients. We conclude that the reversal of anticoagulation with warfarin is achieved more rapidly by intravenous administration of Vitamin K. Satisfactory, but slower, reversal of anticoagulation can be effected using oral Vitamin K, but there may be differences in efficacy between the products tested in our study."
1982,7053763,Cold-induced contact surface activation of the prothrombin time in whole blood.,"Studies of the prothrombin time (PT) have revealed that contact with borosilicate or commercial siliconized borosilicate markedly shortens the PT. This shortening is related to the activation of the contact phase of blood coagulation. This shortening of the PT occurs in both normal whole blood and plasma when stored in borosilicate or siliconized borosilicate tubes at 4 degree C and to a lesser degree at room temperature. Studies indicated the importance of several coagulation factors in decreasing the PT. The PT did not change in blood deficient in factor XII or in plasma deficient in Fletcher factor or high molecular weight kininogen, while blood deficient in CI esterase inhibitor (CI INH) had the most profound shortening. Shortening of the PT correlated directly with increased levels of factor VII. When purified CI INH was added to normal blood, it markedly reduced the activation of factor VII and the shortening of the PT in a dose-related manner. These studies indicate the pivotal roles of the contact phase of coagulation in initiating activation of the PT and of CI INH in inhibiting the activation of the coagulation factor(s) responsible for the cold-promoted activation of factor VII."
2012,22244053,A high-fat diet containing whole walnuts (Juglans regia) reduces tumour size and growth along with plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) has been linked to fat intake, but the effects of both different dietary fat levels and types remain inconsistent and incompletely characterised. The effects on PCa in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) cancer model of an elevated fat (20 % of energy as fat) diet containing 155 g of whole walnuts were compared to those of an elevated fat (20 % of energy as soyabean oil) diet with matched macronutrients, tocopherols as well as a low-fat (8 % of energy as soyabean oil) diet. Mice, starting at 8 weeks of age, consumed one of the three different diets ad libitum; and prostates, livers and blood were obtained after 9, 18 or 24 weeks of feeding. No differences were observed in whole animal growth rates in either high-fat (HF) diet group, but prostate tumour weight and growth rate were reduced in the walnut diet group. Walnut diet group prostate weight, plasma insulin-like growth factor 1, resistin and LDL were lower at 18 weeks, while no statistically significant prostate weight differences by diet were seen at 9 or 24 weeks. Multiple metabolites in the livers differed by diet at 9 and 18 weeks. The walnut diet's beneficial effects probably represent the effects of whole walnuts' multiple constituents and not via a specific fatty acid or tocopherols. Moreover, as the two HF diets had dissimilar effects on prostate tumour growth rate and size, and yet had the same total fat and tocopherol composition and content, this suggests that these are not strongly linked to PCa growth."
1992,1375109,In vivo efficacy of B43 (anti-CD19)-pokeweed antiviral protein immunotoxin against BCL-1 murine B-cell leukemia.,"We show that a highly aggressive subclone of murine BCL-1 B-lineage leukemia expresses a single 2.4-kb transcript hybridizing to the human CD19 cDNA probe and reacts strongly with the anti-human CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) B43, B4, Leu-12, and J3-119. In contrast to their strong reactivity with anti-human CD19 MoAb, BCL-1 cells show no reactivity with MoAb directed against human CD22, CD72, HLA-DR, IgD, or IgM. Western blot analysis of BCL-1 whole cell lysates with the anti-human CD19 MoAb J3-119 showed a single 69-Kd protein band, which was not detected by the negative control MoAb G19.4 (anti-CD3). In contrast to BCL-1 cells, normal BALB/c splenocytes or mouse splenocyte/myeloma hybridoma cell lines did not (1) express any transcripts that hybridized to the human CD19 cDNA probe, (2) react with B43/anti-CD19 MoAb, or (3) express the 69-Kd protein that reacts with the anti-human CD19 MoAb J3-119. Murine BCL-1 B-cell leukemia thus provides a unique model of disseminated B-lineage leukemia to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of anti-CD19 immunotoxins. This model was subsequently used to evaluate the in vivo homing ability, pharmacokinetics, and antileukemic efficacy of B43 MoAb conjugated to the plant hemitoxin pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP). B43-PAP immunotoxin (1) showed strong and antigen-specific reactivity with BCL-1 cells, (2) promptly penetrated the spleens of leukemic mice, (3) rapidly reduced the BCL-1 leukemia burden of leukemic mice and, most importantly, (4) improved survival. Finally, B43-PAP immunotoxin was more effective against BCL-1 leukemia than 700 cGy (LD100/30) total body irradiation (TBI) followed by syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT)."
,19105402,[Anticoagulant activity of fucoidans from brown algae].,"The anticoagulant activity of polysaccharide fucoidans from 11 species of brown algae was studied. The anticoagulant activity was measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time and thrombin time. Inhibitory action of fucoidans varied significantly from one species to another. Fucoidans from Laminaria saccharina and Fucus distichus showed high anticoagulant activities, while fucoidans from Cladosiphon okamuranus and Analipus japonicus were almost inactive. The fucoidan inhibitory effect on thrombin and factor Xa in the presence or in the absence of natural thrombin inhibitor, antithrombin III (AT III), was also studied. In contrast to the best studied anticoagulant heparin the most of the fucoidans inhibited thrombin in the absence of AT III. In the presence of AT III inhibitory effect of fucoidans was increased considerably. Unlike heparin, the effect of fucoidans on factor Xa was very weak in the presence of AT III and was not observed in the absence of AT III. The correlation between the anticoagulant activities of this series of fucoidans and their anti-inflammatory action, studied by us earlier, was not found. It is expected that two these types of fucoidan activities depend on different structural features of fucoidans. These findings show the possibility to obtain fucoidans with high anti-inflammatory action and with low anticoagulant activity. Anticoagulant activity of the fucoidans did not depend on the content of fucose, the other neutral sugars and sulfates in the preparations, and also on the structure of the backbone of molecule. Taken together, these results indicate on prospects of fucoidan study as potential therapeutic agents."
2019,30784941,Pinus halepensis essential oil attenuates the toxic Alzheimer's amyloid beta (1-42)-induced memory impairment and oxidative stress in the rat hippocampus.,"The most prevalent neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's dementia. It is determined by the deposits of amyloid-beta peptide which leads to memory impairment, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Aromatherapy by using essential oils could represent a natural treatment option for Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the neuroprotective and nootropic effects of Pinus halepensis essential oil (PNO, 1% and 3%, administered for three weeks) in a rat model of acute amyloid beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42) toxicity. Rats were behaviorally tested (radial arm maze and Y-maze activities being used). Rats were divided into five groups (n = 5 / group): first group - vehicle, second group - Aβ1-42, the third and fourth group - PNO treatment groups (1% and 3%), and fifth group - donepezil group (as positive control, 5 mg/kg injected in Aβ1-42-treated rats). Antioxidant activity of the investigated essential oil was assessed using radical scavenging assays, such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) tests. Also, biochemical estimations of the brain homogenates for acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress biomarkers were carried out. The essential oil reversed the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced decreasing of the spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test and the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced increasing of the working and reference memory errors in the radial arm maze test. The amyloid beta (1-42)-induced modification of the balance oxidant-antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase action in the hippocampus of the rat has been ameliorated using the essential oil. These findings suggested that Pinus halepensis essential oil has nootropic and neuroprotective activities and may be regarded as a therapeutic tool for attenuation of Aβ toxicity and neuronal dysfunction."
2016,27912736,Citrus junos Tanaka peel ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet.,"Citrus junos Tanaka (yuja), a yellow-coloured citrus fruit has traditionally been consumed in Korea, Japan, and China and has been found effective in preventing certain diseases. However, the inhibitory effect of yuja on hepatic lipid accumulation has not been clearly elucidated thus far.The inhibitory effect of yuja on hepatic lipid accumulation was investigated in both cell culture and mouse models. We investigated the inhibitory effect of ethanol extract of yuja peel (YE) using HepG2 cells. We next confirmed the effect of YE in mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 8): a normal diet group (ND), a high-cholesterol diet group (HC), high-cholesterol diet plus 1% YE (YL), high-cholesterol diet plus 5% YE (YH).Seventy percent ethanolic extracts of yuja peel (YE) reduced oleic acid-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Treatment with YE at 100, 200 μg/mL up-regulated expression levels of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins such as AMPK, ACC, PPAR-α, and CPT1 and down-regulated the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The hypocholesterolemic effect of YE was further confirmed in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. Compared to ND (normal diet) mice, HC (high-cholesterol diet) mice showed increased body weight, liver fat content, liver weight, and content of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. On the contrary, administrations of YL (HC + 1% YE) or YH (HC + 5% YE) significantly reduced body weight, liver fat content, liver weight, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol compared to those of only HC fed mice group. As a result of in vitro data, protein expressions of PPAR-α and CPT1 were induced in mice fed YE diet compared to HC diet but HMGCR expression was decreased.Yuja peel ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in both cell culture and mouse models and therefore, could serve as a useful supplement for hypercholesterolemia."
2019,30502133,Spatial changes in leaf biochemical profile of two tea cultivars following cold storage under two different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions.,"Withering is considered a crucial stage of black tea processing. In this study, tea shoots from two cultivars (cvs. Yabukita and Clone 2) were stored at 5 °C, in either a low or high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) environment, to determine the impact of different withering rates on physiology (viz. respiration rate [RR], colour and moisture loss) and biochemical profile (viz. individual catechins, methylxanthines) of tea shoots (Camellia sinensis). Low VPD and high VPD conditions during withering increased caffeine levels in Clone 2 and Yabukita, respectively (p < 0.05). Caffeine levels steadily increased over time in both cultivars (p < 0.05), coinciding with a rapid decline in theobromine (TB). Furthermore, stems contained lower epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine (ca. 75 and 56%, respectively) compared to bud and larger leaf (LL) (p < 0.05). Overall, the results of this study highlight factors such as mechanical harvesting, and hard or soft withering, which could affect final tea beverage quality."
2001,11353616,Teicoplanin stress-selected mutations increasing sigma(B) activity in Staphylococcus aureus.,"A natural rsbU mutant of Staphylococcus aureus, unable to activate the alternative transcription factor sigma(B) via the RsbU pathway and therefore forming unpigmented colonies, produced first-step teicoplanin-resistant mutants upon selection for growth in the presence of teicoplanin, of which the majority were of an intense orange color. By using an asp23 promoter-luciferase fusion as an indicator, the pigmented mutants were shown to express increased sigma(B) activity. Increased sigma(B) activity was associated with point mutations in rsbW, releasing sigma(B) from sequestration by the anti-sigma factor RsbW, or to promoter mutations increasing the sigma(B)/RsbW ratio. Genetic manipulations involving the sigB operon suggested that the mutations within the operon were associated with the increase in teicoplanin resistance. The upregulation of sigma(B) suggests that a sigma(B)-controlled gene(s) is directly or indirectly involved in the development of teicoplanin resistance in S. aureus. Carotenoids do not contribute to teicoplanin resistance, since inactivation of the dehydrosqualene synthase gene crtM abolished pigment formation without affecting teicoplanin resistance. The relevant sigma(B)-controlled target genes involved in teicoplanin resistance remain to be identified."
2012,22953802,Spectrofluorimetric determination of ellagic acid in brandy.,Two spectrofluorimetric methods have been developed for the rapid determination of ellagic acid. The first method is based on the complex formation between ellagic acid and borax in methanol solution. The fluorescence of the complex is monitored at an emission wavelength of 456nm with excitation at 383nm. Linear calibration curve was obtained from 2.5×10(-8) to 7.5×10(-7)molL(-1) and the limit of determination was 4×10(-9)molL(-1). The second method is based on the complex formation between ellagic acid and boric acid in ethanol solution. The fluorescence of the complex is monitored at an emission wavelength of 447nm with excitation at 387nm. Linear calibration curve was obtained from 1.25×10(-7) to 1.00×10(-6)molL(-1) and the limit of determination was 7×10(-9)molL(-1). The methods were successfully applied for the determination of ellagic acid in brandy samples. The results were found to be in good agreement with those obtained by HPLC method.
2018,29350052,Protective mechanisms of 6-gingerol in dextran sulfate sodium-induced chronic ulcerative colitis in mice.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of the colon, with an increasing incidence worldwide. 6-Gingerol (6G) is a bioactive constituent of Zingiber officinale, which has been reported to possess various biological activities. This study was designed to evaluate the role of 6G in chronic UC. Chronic UC was induced in mice by three cycles of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. Each cycle consisted of 7 days of 2.5% DSS followed by 14 days of normal drinking water. 6G (100 mg/kg) and a reference anti-colitis drug sulfasalazine (SZ) (100 mg/kg) were orally administered daily to the mice throughout exposure to three cycles of 2.5% DSS. Administration of 6G and SZ significantly prevented disease activity index and aberrant crypt foci formation in DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, 6G and SZ suppresses immunoexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the DSS-treated mice. 6G effectively protected against colonic oxidative damage by augmenting the antioxidant status with marked decrease in lipid peroxidation levels in DSS-treated mice. Moreover, 6G significantly inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (P65), p38, cyclooxygenase-2, and β-catenin whereas it enhanced IL-10 and adenomatous polyposis coli expression in DSS-treated mice. In conclusion, 6G prevented DSS-induced chronic UC via anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms and preservation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway."
2014,25219324,Resveratrol inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and renal fibrosis by antagonizing the hedgehog signaling pathway.,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biologic process in which tubular cells lose their epithelial phenotypes and acquire new characteristic features of mesenchymal properties, is increasingly recognized as an integral part of renal tissue fibrogenesis. Recent studies indicate that resveratrol, a botanical compound derived mainly from the skins of red grapes, may have anti-fibrotic effects in many tissues, but the potential molecular mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we identified that resveratrol inhibits the induction of EMT and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) through antagonizing the hedgehog pathway in vitro and in vivo. In rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), administration of resveratrol (20mg/kg/day) significantly reduced serum creatinine. Resveratrol also decreased expression of TGF-β1, and inhibited the phenotypic transition from epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells, and the deposition of ECM in UUO rats. In cultured renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E), TGF-β1-induced EMT and ECM synthesis was abolished with the treatment of resveratrol. The induction of EMT was associated with the activation of the hedgehog pathway. Resveratrol treatment markedly inhibited the over-activity of the hedgehog pathway in the obstructed kidney and in TGF-β1-treated NRK-52E cells, resulted in reduction of cellular proliferation, EMT and ECM accumulation. Thus, these results suggest that resveratrol is able to inhibit EMT and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro through antagonizing the hedgehog pathway, and resveratrol may have therapeutic potential for patients with fibrotic kidney diseases.

2010,19584824,"Allogeneic and autologous transplantation for haematological diseases, solid tumours and immune disorders: current practice in Europe 2009.","The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation regularly publishes special reports on the current practice of haematopoietic SCT for haematological diseases, solid tumours and immune disorders in Europe. Major changes have occurred since the first report was published. HSCT today includes grafting with allogeneic and autologous stem cells derived from BM, peripheral blood and cord blood. With reduced-intensity conditioning regimens in allogeneic transplantation, the age limit has increased, permitting the inclusion of older patients. New indications have emerged, such as autoimmune disorders and AL amyloidosis for autologous HSCT and solid tumours, myeloproliferative syndromes and specific subgroups of lymphomas for allogeneic transplants. The introduction of alternative therapies, such as imatinib for CML, has challenged well-established indications. An updated report with revised tables and operating definitions is presented."
2018,30257330,Raspberry ketone preserved cholinergic activity and antioxidant defense in obesity induced Alzheimer disease in rats.,"Obesity is a proven risk factor for neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidences suggested that nutritional interventions provide potential for prevention and treatment of AD. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary treatment of obese rats with natural Raspberry ketone (RK) and their relationship with neurodegeneration. Obesity was first induced in 40 male Wistar rats (140-160 g) by feeding high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Obese rats were then assigned into 4 groups (n = 10 each). (O-AD) is obese induced AD group maintained on HFD for another 6 weeks. OCR is obese group received calorie restricted diet for 6 weeks. OCRRK is obese group received calorie restricted diet and RK (44 mg/kg body weight, daily, orally) for 6 weeks and OCRD is obese group received calorie restricted diet and orlistate (10 mg/kg body weight, daily orally) for 6 weeks. Another 10 normal rats received normal diet were used as normal control group (NC). Body weight, visceral white adipose tissue weight (WAT), lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, adiponectin, cholinergic activity and amyloid extracellular plaques were examined. In addition to histological changes in brain tissues were evaluated.Raspberry ketone (RK) via its antioxidant properties attenuated oxidative damage and dyslipidemia in O-AD group. It inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AchE) and hence increased acetylcholine level (Ach) in brain tissues of O-AD rats. It is also impeded the upregulation of beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) and the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques which crucially involved in AD. The combination of CR diet with RK was more effective than CR diet with orlistate (antiobese drug) in abrogating the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity. Results from this study suggested that concomitant supplementation of RK with calorie restricted regimen effectively modulate the neurodegenerative changes induced by obesity and delay the progression of AD."
2014,24938777,Neuroprotective effects of Citrus reticulata in scopolamine-induced dementia oxidative stress in rats.,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of Citrus reticulate (mandarin) peel methanolic extract (MPME) on memory dysfunction in rats. Memory impairment was produced by scopolamine (1.4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally injected). Brain acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity was measured to assess the central cholinergic activity. This study also investigated the effect of scopolamine on norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin content in rat hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. In addition, the levels of brain lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) were estimated to assess the degree of oxidative stress. Scopolamine administration induced a significant impairment of central cholinergic activity in rats, as indicated by a marked increase in AChE activity. The impairment of the cholinergic system was associated with a significant alternation in brain monoamines. Scopolamine administration also caused oxidant damage (elevation in LPO and NO and reduction in GSH levels). Pretreatment of MPME (250 mg/kg, orally administered) significantly reduced scopolamine-induced alternation in brain monoamines with an attenuation of scopolamine-induced rise in brain AChE activity and brain oxidative stress. It is concluded that administration of mandarin peel extract, demonstrating antioxidant activity, may be of value for dementia exhibiting elevated brain oxidative status."
2008,18684219,Attenuation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by oxymatrine is associated with regulation of fibroblast proliferation and collagen production in primary culture.,"There is no satisfactory treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, which is characterized by altered control of proliferation of mesenchymal fibroblasts and extracellular matrix production. Oxymatrine is an alkaloid extracted from the Chinese herb Sophora japonica (Sophora flavescens Ait.) with capacities of anti-inflammation, inhibition of immune reaction, antivirus, protection against acute lung injury and antihepatic fibrosis. In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on pulmonary fibrosis was investigated using a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. The results showed that bleomycin challenge provoked severe pulmonary fibrosis with marked increase in hydroxyproline content of lung tissue and lung fibrosis fraction, which was prevented by oxymatrine in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, bleomycin injection resulted in a marked increase of myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde level that was attenuated by oxymatrine. Administration of oxymatrine inhibited the proliferation of murine lung fibroblasts, arrested the cells at G(0)/G(1) phase and reduced the expression of cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin D1 in vitro. Furthermore, the steady-state production of collagen and the expression of alpha1(I) pro-collagen and alpha2(I) pro-collagen mRNA in fibroblasts were inhibited by oxymatrine in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that oxymatrine may attenuate pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in mice, partly through inhibition of inflammatory response and lipid peroxidation in lung induced by bleomycin and reduction of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis."
2010,20797388,"Influence of the flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin on the function of organic anion transporting polypeptides 1A2 and 2B1.","OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 are uptake transporters of the human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family with a broad substrate spectrum including several endogenous compounds as well as drugs such as the antihistaminic drug fexofenadine and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Both transporters are localized in the apical membrane of human enterocytes. Flavonoids, abundantly occurring in plants, have previously been shown to interact with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. However, the impact of flavonoids on OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 transport function has not been analyzed in detail. Therefore, HEK293 cell lines stably expressing OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 were used to investigate the influence of the Ginkgo flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin on the transport activity of OATP1A2 and OATP2B1. K(i) values of all three flavonoids determined from Dixon plot analyses using BSP as substrate indicated a competitive inhibition with quercetin as the most potent inhibitor of OATP1A2 (22.0μM) and OATP2B1 (8.7μM) followed by kaempferol (OATP1A2: 25.2μM, OATP2B1: 15.1μM) and apigenin (OATP1A2: 32.4μM OATP2B1: 20.8μM). Apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin led to a concentration-dependent decrease of the OATP1A2-mediated fexofenadine transport with IC(50) values of 4.3μM, 12.0μM, and 12.6μM, respectively. The OATP1A2- and OATP2B1-mediated transport of atorvastatin was also efficiently inhibited by apigenin (IC(50) for OATP1A2: 9.3μM, OATP2B1: 13.9μM), kaempferol (IC(50) for OATP1A2: 37.3μM, OATP2B1: 20.7μM) and quercetin (IC(50) for OATP1A2: 13.5μM, OATP2B1: 14.1μM). These data indicate that modification of OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 transport activity by apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin may be a mechanism for food-drug or drug-drug interactions in humans."
2013,23561123,Free fatty acid profiles of emulsified lipids during in vitro digestion with pancreatic lipase.,"Individual free fatty acids released from milk protein-stabilized emulsions prepared with milk fat, soya bean oil or tuna fish oil during in vitro digestion with pancreatic lipase were monitored using gas chromatography. The results showed that saturated fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0) were released faster than unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9, C18:2n6 and C18:3n3) from soya bean oil emulsions; short chain fatty acids were released faster than long chain fatty acids from milk fat emulsions; long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were released more slowly than other fatty acids from fish oil emulsions. The results confirm that the release behaviour of fatty acids from emulsions during digestion is related not only to the position of the fatty acids in the triglycerides in the fat/oil, but also to the length of the carbon chain of the fatty acid. The rates and the extents of the digestion of lipids consisting of short chain fatty acids are higher than those of lipids consisting of long chain fatty acids."
2017,28029283,Evaluation of procoagulant tissue factor expression in canine hemangiosarcoma cell lines.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate expression of procoagulant tissue factor (TF) by canine hemangiosarcoma cells in vitro. SAMPLES 4 canine hemangiosarcoma cell lines (SB-HSA [mouse-passaged cutaneous tumor], Emma [primary metastatic brain tumor], and Frog and Dal-1 [primary splenic tumors]) and 1 nonneoplastic canine endothelial cell line (CnAoEC). PROCEDURES TF mRNA and TF antigen expression were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Thrombin generation was measured in canine plasma and in coagulation factor-replete or specific coagulation factor-deficient human plasma by calibrated automated thrombography. Corn trypsin inhibitor and annexin V were used to examine contributions of contact activation and membrane-bound phosphatidylserine, respectively, to thrombin generation. RESULTS All cell lines expressed TF mRNA and antigen, with significantly greater expression of both products in SB-HSA and Emma cells than in CnAoEC. A greater percentage of SB-HSA cells expressed TF antigen, compared with other hemangiosarcoma cell lines. All hemangiosarcoma cell lines generated significantly more thrombin than did CnAoEC in canine or factor-replete human plasma. Thrombin generation induced by SB-HSA cells was significantly lower in factor VII-deficient plasma than in factor-replete plasma and was abolished in factor X-deficient plasma; residual thrombin generation in factor VII-deficient plasma was abolished by incubation of cells with annexin V. Thrombin generation by SB-HSA cells was unaffected by the addition of corn trypsin inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Hemangiosarcoma cell lines expressed procoagulant TF in vitro. Further research is needed to determine whether TF can be used as a biomarker for hemostatic dysfunction in dogs with hemangiosarcoma."
2019,30724258,Reliable determination of tropane alkaloids in cereal based baby foods coupling on-line spe to mass spectrometry avoiding chromatographic step.,"Cereal based foods are a major part of the infant diet and they can be contaminated with Solanaceae and other plants containing tropane alkaloids. This study was focused on the optimisation of an extraction procedure based on a solid-liquid method and an online SPE system, directly coupled to different mass spectrometry analysers as Orbitrap and triple quadrupole (QqQ), removing the chromatographic separation step. Total running analysis time was 15.8 min (17.3 min in the QqQ system). The developed method was validated obtaining recoveries ranging from 66 to 98% and 68-97% for the Orbitrap and QqQ respectively (RSD lower than 14.3%) and limits of quantification from 0.5 to 5 µg kg-1 and 0.5-10 µg kg-1 for the QqQ and Orbitrap analyser respectively. The validated method was applied to several cereal based baby food samples, finding a positive sample containing atropine (11.5 µg kg-1), scopolamine (2.8 µg kg-1) and apoatropine (7.5 µg kg-1)."
2003,14615068,The mechanism of retinol-induced irritation and its application to anti-irritant development.,"Despite many beneficial effects on dermatological applications, retinol and its derivatives cause severe local irritation manifested as mild erythema and stratum corneum peeling of the skin. It is hypothesized that cytokines may be important inflammatory mediators in retinoid-induced dermatitis. The present study was designed to determine cytokine mediators and thereby, to screen potential anti-irritants in retinoid-induced inflammation. The changes in mRNA expression of inflammation-related cytokines including mouse analogue of human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (JE), mouse analogue of human interleukin-8 (IL-8) (KC), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-12p40, IL-6, IL-10, Eotaxin were determined in mouse epidermal cells treated by 2% retinol using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The up-regulated mRNA level was confirmed with protein levels in culture supernatants from human epidermal keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts treated with 10 microM retinol or retinoic acid. As results, retinoid-induced inflammation was mainly mediated through MCP-1 and IL-8 as evidenced by increased levels of mRNA expression and protein secretion. The potential anti-irritant substances including beta-sitosterol, Magnoliae flos, beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, SC-glucan, Ginko extract, Raspberry extract, Schisandra extract, Cola extract, Enna complex or Vegetol red grapevine extract were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on retinol-induced cytokine (MCP-1 and IL-8) secretion in vitro cultured human fibroblasts. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy tests for the retinol-induced irritancy were performed using Draize skin irritation test in the rabbit and human patch test. Most of the substances that reduced the secretion of MCP-1 and IL-8 in vitro cultured fibroblasts, showed a good inhibition against the retinol-induced irritation in the rabbit and human patch test. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that among proinflammatory cytokines, MCP-1 and IL-8 mainly mediated retinol-induced skin irritation, and that inhibition of production of these cytokines can be applied as good markers to screen the anti-irritants against the retinol-induced irritation."

2005,16106594,Melagatran and ximelagatran: new drug. No real simplification of anticoagulant therapy.,"(1) The reference drug for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after hip or knee replacement surgery is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), given subcutaneously for 1 to 5 weeks. Vitamin K antagonists, including warfarin, have similar risk-benefit balances. (2) Subcutaneous melagatran and its oral metabolic precursor ximelagatran have recently been granted marketing authorisation in France for use as prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement surgery. Melagatran, unlike LMWH, is a specific thrombin inhibitor. (3) There are four randomised double-blind trials in more than 9000 patients comparing these agents with a LMWH (enoxaparin in three trials, dalteparin in one). Melagatran was given subcutaneously for one or two days before being replaced with ximelagatran (as soon as oral feeding was possible) for 6 to 9 days. These trials showed no advantage of melagatran-ximelagatran in terms of clinical endpoints such as symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death from all causes. (4) Three randomised double-blind trials have compared ximelagatran with warfarin in more than 5000 patients. Treatment lasted 7 to 12 days. Ximelagatran was no better than warfarin when assessed using clinical endpoints. (5) In these trials melagatran-ximelagatran did not increase the risk of bleeding compared with LMWH or warfarin. (6) Melagatran-ximelagatran can cause an increase in serum transaminase activity, and is contraindicated if pretreatment serum transaminase activity is more than twice the upper limit of normal. (7) Trials versus warfarin showed a higher risk of myocardial infarction in patients taking ximelagatran (0.7% versus 0.16%). (8) There are few data on the patient subgroups most likely to receive melagatran-ximelagatran, namely patients over 75, underweight and overweight patients, and patients with renal failure. (9) There is currently no clotting test that allows the melagatran-ximelagatran dose regimen to be adjusted in patients who have an increased risk of adverse effects due to overdosing. There is no available antidote if overdose occurs. (10) Erythromycin increases melagatran bioavailability, thereby increasing the bleeding risk. Melagatran and ximelagatran must not be combined with other anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents or antiplatelet drugs because of a increased bleeding risk. (11) In practice, low-molecular-weight heparin remains the reference prophylactic treatment for venous thromboembolism after hip or knee replacement surgery."
1991,1852143,"Defective function of leukocytes from cattle persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus, and the influence of recombinant cytokines.","Cattle persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus have decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte functions. We reevaluated these functions and further characterized the inhibition of persistent BVD virus infection in neutrophils, using sensitive kinetic assays. In addition, the influence of in vitro incubation of neutrophils with recombinant bovine interferon gamma (rBoIFN gamma) and in vitro incubation of lymphocytes with recombinant bovine interleukin-2 was evaluated. Significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in random migration under agarose, Staphylococcus aureus ingestion, cytochrome-C reduction, iodination, antibody-independent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidant production, and cytoplasmic calcium flux were observed in neutrophils from cattle persistently infected with BVD virus, compared with noninfected control cattle. Incubation of neutrophils from noninfected controls with rBoIFN gamma significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased random migration under agarose, cytochrome-C reduction, and cytoplasmic calcium flux. Neutrophils from cattle persistently infected with BVD virus also had decreased random migration under agarose after incubation with rBoIFN gamma; in addition, antibody-independent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, elastase release, and cytoplasmic calcium flux were significantly enhanced. The rBoIFN gamma induced significantly (P less than 0.05) different effects on chemotaxis, cytochrome-C reduction, iodination, and cytoplasmic calcium flux of neutrophils from infected and control cattle. The rBoIFN gamma was more effective at improving the function of neutrophils from cattle persistently infected with BVD virus, compared with neutrophils from controls. Lymphocytes from infected cattle had decreased blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2004,15760096,Regional permeability of salmon calcitonin in isolated rat gastrointestinal tracts: transport mechanism using Caco-2 cell monolayer.,"The objective of the study was to determine the region of maximum permeation of salmon calcitonin (sCT) through the gastrointestinal tract and to investigate the mechanism of permeation. For regional permeability determination, male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized and the gastrointestinal tissues were isolated. Stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, or colon tissues were mounted on Navicyte side-by-side diffusion apparatus. Salmon calcitonin solutions (50 microm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) were added to the donor side, and the samples were removed from the receiver compartment and analyzed by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA). For mechanistic studies, Caco-2 cells were grown on Transwell inserts (0.4-microm pore size, 0.33 cm2 area) in a humidified 37 degrees C incubator (with 5% CO2). Transport experiments were conducted for sCT solutions (50 microm in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium [DMEM], pH 7.4) from the apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) direction and B-to-A direction at 37 degrees C and from the A-to-B direction at 4 degrees C. Cell monolayer integrity was monitored by mannitol permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. The permeability coefficients (x 10(-9), cm/sec) for sCT through rat stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon tissues were 0.482 +/- 0.086, 0.718 +/- 0.025, 0.830 +/- 0.053, 1.537 +/- 0.32, and 0.934 +/- 0.15, respectively. The region of maximum sCT permeability is ileum followed by colon, jejunum, duodenum, and stomach. The permeability coefficients (x 10(-6), cm/sec) for sCT through Caco-2 cell monolayer were 8.57 +/- 2.34 (A-to-B, 37 degrees C), 8.01 +/- 1.22 (A-to-B, 4 degrees C), and 6.15 +/- 1.97 (B-to-A, 37 degrees C). The mechanism of its permeation is passive diffusion through the mucosa as determined from the Caco-2 monolayer permeability of sCT."
2009,19721229,Therapeutic time window of cannabidiol treatment on delayed ischemic damage via high-mobility group box1-inhibiting mechanism.,"Cannabidiol decreases cerebral infarction and high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1) in plasma in ischemic early phase. However, plasma HMGB1 levels in ischemic delayed phase reach higher concentration with the progressing brain injury. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic time window of cannabidiol on functional deficits, glial HMGB1 and plasma HMGB1 levels in a 4 h mouse middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model. Cannabidiol-treated mice were divided into 3 groups as follows: group (a) treated from day 1, group (b) treated from day 3, group (c) treated from day 5 after MCA occlusion. Moreover, minocycline, microglia inhibitor, and fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of astroglial metabolism, were used to compare with cannabidiol-treated group. Repeated treatment with cannabidiol from 1 and 3 d at the latest after cerebral ischemia improved functional deficits and survival rates. However, cannabidiol from 5 d could not improve the ischemic damage as well as fluorocitrate-treated group. Moreover, both group (a), group (b) and minocycline but not group (c) and fluorocitrate-treated group had a decrease in the number of Iba1 expressing HMGB1 positive cells and HMGB1 levels in plasma. Cannabidiol may provide therapeutic possibilities for the progressing brain injury via HMGB1-inhibiting mechanism."
2017,28948486,Efficacy and Tolerability of Phytomedicines in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Review.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that can cause cognition, mobility, and sensory impairments. It is considered one of the most common non-traumatic causes of disability in the world. The aim of the present article was to review the clinical evidence related to medicinal plants in the management of MS symptoms. Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, and Scopus, were searched for entries from 1966 to February 2017. Only clinical studies were included in this review. Different medicinal plants have positive effects on MS, including Andrographis paniculata, Boswellia papyrifera, Ruta graveolens, Vaccinium spp., Camellia sinensis, Panax ginseng, Aloysia citrodora, Ginkgo biloba, Oenothera biennis, and Cannabis sativa. C. sativa had the highest level of clinical evidence, supporting its efficacy in MS symptoms. Proanthocyanidins, ginkgo flavone glycosides, ginsenosides, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, cannabinoids (including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol), boswellic acid, and andrographolide were presented as the main bioactive components of medicinal plants with therapeutic benefits in MS. The main complications of MS in which natural drugs were effective include spasticity, fatigue, scotoma, incontinence, urinary urgency, nocturia, memory performance, functional performance, and tremor. Herbal medicines were mostly well tolerated, and the adverse effects were limited to mild to moderate. Further well-designed human studies with a large sample size and longer follow-up period are recommended to confirm the role of medicinal plants and their metabolites in the management of MS."
2009,19811694,The red wine polyphenol resveratrol reduces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced DNA damage in MCF-10A cells.,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are procarcinogens that can be commonly found in our food and environment. Upon biotransformation in our body system, they can cause DNA damage through the generation of genotoxic species and oxidative stress. Phase I and II enzymes are pivotal in the process of proximate carcinogen formation and elimination. Some dietary phytochemicals are strong inhibitors to the phase I enzymes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the red wine compound resveratrol on DNA damage induced by PAH in a non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF-10A. Resveratrol ranging from 1 to 5 microm could significantly suppress the expressions of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, CYP1B1 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The comet assay indicated that DMBA introduced DNA damage to these cells, and co-treatment of resveratrol at 5 or 10 microm could alleviate the damage. Further investigation illustrated that resveratrol reduced the binding of DMBA metabolites to DNA with no effect on DMBA-induced oxidative DNA damage. Since the phase II enzyme UGT1A1 was suppressed, the elimination of DMBA metabolites would not have contributed to the reduction in the DMBA metabolite-DNA binding. In summary, resveratrol might protect breast cells against PAH-induced DNA damage. The underlying mechanism was mediated by phase I enzyme suppression rather than phase II enzyme induction or oxidative DNA repair."
2016,27160820,Inhibition of tumor suppressor p53 preserves glycation-serum induced pancreatic beta-cell demise.,"Tumor suppressor p53 is a transcriptional factor that determines cell fate in response to multiple stressors, such as oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, in the majority of cells. However, its role in pancreatic beta cells is not well documented. Our previous research has revealed that glycation-serum (GS) induced pancreatic beta-cell demise through the AGEs-RAGE pathway. In the present study, we investigated the role of p53 in GS-related beta-cell demise. Using pancreatic islets beta-cell line INS-1 cells, we found that with GS treatment, the transcriptional activity of p53 was significantly evoked due to the increased amount of nuclear p53 protein. Resveratrol (RSV) was capable of further enhancing this transcriptional ability and consequently increased the population of dead beta cells under GS exposure. In contrast, inhibiting this transcriptional activity via p53 interference greatly protected beta cells from the damage provoked by GS, as well as damage strengthened by RSV. However, the pharmacological activation of PPARγ with troglitazone (TRO) only suppressed GS-induced, not RSV-induced, p53 activity. Moreover, the activation of PPARγ greatly preserved beta cells from GS-induced death. This protective effect recurred due to improved mitochondrial function with Bcl2 overexpression. Further, p53 activation could induce cellular apoptosis in primary rat islets. Our findings explore the broader role of p53 in regulating pancreatic beta-cell demise in the presence of GS and may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of diabetes."

1990,1703314,Bombesin potentiates the effect of acetylcholine on isolated strips of fish stomach.,"The interaction between bombesin and acetylcholine acting on smooth muscle of the stomach wall was investigated in two species of teleost fish. Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) and Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod). Acetylcholine or bombesin alone has an excitatory effect on the stomach muscle. The effect on contraction amplitude of acetylcholine (10(-6)-10(-5) M) alone is about 10-times greater than the effect of bombesin (10(-9)-10(-7) M). In molar terms however, bombesin is more potent than acetylcholine. Bombesin (10(-8)-10(-7) M) added 0.5-3 min prior to acetylcholine potentiates the effect of acetylcholine in a dose-dependent manner. The potentiation is most pronounced in circular muscle preparations, but is present also in longitudinal muscle preparations. Bombesin affects the response to carbachol (10(-6) M) with a similar potentiation, indicating that the potentiation is not caused by inhibition of choline esterase activity. Atropine (10(-6)-10(-5) M) abolishes the response to bombesin plus acetylcholine as well as the response to acetylcholine alone. Tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) does not block the effect of acetylcholine, bombesin or the combination acetylcholine plus bombesin. Substance P (10(-9)-10(-7) M) which has a similar excitatory effect on the stomach muscle as bombesin, does not potentiate the effect of acetylcholine. Immunohistochemistry has shown the presence of strong bombesin-like immunoreactivity in stomach nerves of the cod and weak bombesin-like immunoreactivity in rainbow trout nerves. In addition, bombesin-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in endocrine cells in the gastric and intestinal mucosa of both species. It is concluded that bombesin, contained either in nerve fibres or in mucosal endocrine cells, specifically potentiates the effect of acetylcholine in the fish stomach."
1996,8634430,Regulation of platelet production and function by megakaryocyte growth and development factor in nonhuman primates.,"The primary physiologic regulator of platelet production, Mpl ligand, has recently been cloned and characterized. To define the regulatory role of Mpl ligand on platelet production and function we measured the effects of a recombinant truncated human Mpl ligand, megakaryocyte growth and development factor (rHu-MGDF) on megakaryocytopoiesis, platelet function, and thrombogenesis in nonhuman primates. rHu-MGDF was administered to 10 baboons for 28 days while performing pharmacokinetics and repeated measurements of the following: (1) platelet count, volume, turnover, and function ex vivo and in vitro; (2) marrow megakaryocyte number, volume, and ploidy; and (3) platelet deposition and fibrin accumulation on segments of vascular graft and endarterectomized aorta in vivo. Daily subcutaneous injections of rHu-MGDF (5 microgram/kg/d) attained plasma concentrations averaging 1,300 +/- 300 pg/mL 2 hours after injection with trough levels of 300 +/- 65 pg/mL before the next dose. These levels of rHu-MGDF incrementally increased the peripheral platelet concentration threefold by day 7 and fivefold by day 28 (P < 10(-4)) associated with a reciprocal decrease of 25% in mean platelet volumes (P < 10(-3)). Platelet mass turnover, a steady-state measure of platelet production, increased fivefold (P < 10(-4)). Platelet morphology, life span, and recovery were normal. No significant change occurred in peripheral leukocyte, neutrophil, or erythrocyte counts (P > .1 in all cases). The platelet count gradually returned to baseline within 2 weeks after discontinuing rHu-MGDF infections. Marrow megakaryocyte volume doubled (P < 10(-3)) three days after initiating rHu-MGDF therapy and the modal ploidy shifted from 16N to 64N (P < 10(-4)). Marrow megakaryocyte number increased twofold by day 7, and nearly fourfold by day 28 (P < 10(-4)), resulting in a 6.5-fold increase in marrow megakaryocyte mass (P < 10(-3)). The effects of rHu-MGDF on thrombosis were determined by comparing baseline, day 5, and day 28 rHu-MGDF-treatment measurements of 111In-platelet deposition and 125I-fibrin accumulation on segments of homologous endarterectomized aorta (EA) and vascular graft (VG) interposed in arteriovenous femoral shunts. rHu-MGDF increased 111In-platelet deposition in direct proportion to the circulating concentration of platelets for both EA and VG (r=.98 in both cases), without significant changes in fibrin accumulation (P > .5 in both cases). During the first week of rHu-MGDF treatment ex vivo platelet aggregatory responsiveness was enhanced to physiologic agonists (adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and thrombin receptor agonist peptide, TRAP1-6) (P < .05 in all cases). Although in vitro platelet aggregation was not induced by any concentration of rHu-MGDF tested (P > .5), rHu-MGDF enhanced aggregatory responses to low doses of physiologic agonists, effects that were maximal at 10 ng/mL for baboon platelets and 100 ng/mL for human platelets, and were blocked by excess soluble c-Mpl receptor. Flow cytometric expression of platelet activation epitopes was not increased on resting platelets (ligand-induced binding sites, P-selectin, or Annexin V binding sites; P > .1 in all cases). Megakaryocyte growth and development factor regulates platelet production and function by stimulating endoreduplication and megakaryocyte formation from marrow progenitor cells, and transiently enhancing platelet functional responses ex vivo. rHu-MGDF has the potential for achieving platelet hemostatic protection with minimal thrombo-occlusive risk."
2016,27776525,Douchi (fermented Glycine max Merr.) alleviates atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice by regulation of PKC and IL-4.,"Douchi (fermented Glycine max Merr.) is produced from fermented soybeans, which is widely used in traditional herbal medicine. In this study, we investigated whether Douchi attenuates protein kinase C (PKC) and interleukin (IL)-4 response and cutaneous inflammation in Atopic dermatitis (AD)-like NC/Nga mice.To induce AD-like skin lesions, D. farinae antigen was applied to the dorsal skin of 3-week-old NC/Nga mice. After inducing AD, Douchi extract was administered 20 mg/kg daily for 3 weeks to the Douchi-treated mice group. We identified the changes of skin barrier and Th2 differentiation through PKC and IL-4 by immunohistochemistry.Douchi treatment of NC/Nga mice significantly reduced clinical scores (p < 0.01) and histological features. The levels of PKC and IL-4 were significantly reduced in the Douchi-treated group (p < 0.01). The reduction of IL-4 and PKC led to decrease of inflammatory factors such as substance P, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) (all p < 0.01). Douchi also down-regulated Th1 markers (IL-12, TNF-α) as well as Th2 markers (IL-4, p-IκB) (p < 0.01).Douchi alleviates AD-like skin lesions through suppressing of PKC and IL-4. These results also lead to diminish levels of substance P, iNOS and MMP-9 in skin lesions. Therefore, Douchi may have potential applications for the prevention and treatment of AD."
2011,21719998,Cornuside suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory mediators by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages.,"Cornuside, a secoiridoid glucoside compound, was isolated from the fruit of Cornus officinalis SIEB. et ZUCC. Cornuside has been reported to possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effects and mechanism of action of cornuside in inflammation have not been fully characterized. The present study was therefore designed to examine whether cornuside suppresses inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Cornuside significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E(2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1beta. The mRNA and protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also decreased by cornuside. Furthermore, cornuside significantly attenuated the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha and the subsequent translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus. Cornuside also reduced the phosphorylations of extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2). These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory property of cornuside is related to the downregulations of iNOS and COX-2 due to NF-κB inhibition as well as the negative regulation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 phosphorylations in RAW 264.7 cells."
2019,30611789,Synergistic anticancer activity of doxorubicin and piperlongumine on DU-145 prostate cancer cells - The involvement of carbonyl reductase 1 inhibition.,"One of the causes of therapeutic failure of chemotherapy is cancer cell resistance. In the case of anthracyclines, many resistance mechanisms have been described. One of them assumes the role of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a cytosolic enzyme that is responsible for the biotransformation process of anthracyclines to less active, undesirable metabolites. Therefore, CBR1 inhibitors are considered for use as a chemosensitizing agents. In the present study, piperlongumine (PL), a Piper longum L. alkaloid that has previously been described as a CBR1 inhibitor, was investigated for its chemosensitizing properties in co-treatment with doxorubicin (DOX). The biotransformation process of DOX in the presence of PL was tracked using human cytosol fraction and LC-MS, then a molecular modeling study was conducted to predict the interaction of PL with the active site of the CBR1. The biological interaction between DOX and PL was investigated using DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties of DOX and PL were examined, and the type and potency of interaction was quantified by Combination Index. The mechanism of the cell death induced by the agents was investigated by flow cytometry and the anti-invasive properties of the drugs were determined by monitoring the movement of individual cells. PL showed dose-dependent inhibition of DOX metabolism in cytosol, which resulted in less doxorubicinol (DOXol) metabolite being formed. The possible mechanism of CBR1 inhibition was explained through molecular modeling studies by prediction of PL's binding mode in the active site of the enzyme's crystal structure-based model. DOX and PL showed a synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on cancer cells. Significant anti-invasive properties of the combination of DOX and PL were found, but when the drugs were used separately they did not alter the cancer cells' motility. Cell motility inhibition was accompanied by significant changes in cytoskeleton architecture. DOX and PL used in co-treatment showed significant synergistic anticancer properties. Inhibition of DOX metabolism by PL was found to be a mechanism that was likely to be responsible for the observed interaction."
2018,29940929,The potential of Olea europaea extracts to prevent TGFβ1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human nasal respiratory epithelial cells.,"One of the molecular mechanisms involved in upper airway-related diseases is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Olea europaea (OE) has anti-inflammatory properties and thus, great potential to prevent EMT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of OE on EMT in primary nasal human respiratory epithelial cells (RECs).Respiratory epithelial cells were isolated and divided into four groups: control (untreated), treated with 0.05% OE (OE group), EMT induced with 5 ng/ml of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1 group) and treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 + 0.05% OE (TGFβ1 + OE group). The effects of OE treatment on growth kinetics, morphology and protein expression in RECs were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to quantitate the total percentage of E-cadherin and vimentin expression from day 1 to day 3.There were no significant differences between untreated RECs and OE-treated RECs in terms of their morphology, growth kinetics and protein expression. Induction with TGFβ1 caused RECs to have an elongated spindle shape, a slower proliferation rate, a higher expression of vimentin and a lower expression of E-cadherin compared with the control. Cells in the TGFβ1 + OE group had similar epithelial shape to untreated group however it had no significant differences in their proliferation rate when compared to TGFβ1-induced RECs. Cells treated with TGFβ1 + OE showed significantly reduced expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin compared with the TGFβ1 group (P < 0.05).The ability of OE to inhibit EMT in RECs was shown by TGFb1-induced EMT REC morphology, growth kinetics and protein expression markers (E-cadherin and vimentin) upon treatment with OE and TGFβ1. Therefore, this study could provide insight into the therapeutic potential of OE to inhibit pathological tissue remodelling and persistent inflammation."
2017,28372160,Characterization of cereal flours by fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with PARAFAC.,"This paper presents parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence of cereal flours. Excitation-emission matrices (EEM's) of different cereal flours (wheat, corn, rye, rice, oat, spelt, barley and buckwheat) were measured in a front-face configuration over the ultraviolet-visible spectral range. EEM's showed that flours strongly fluoresce in two spectral regions, where amino acids, tocopherols, pyridoxine and 4-aminobenzoic acid show intense emissions. 4-component PARAFAC was used to model flour fluorescence and to decompose EEM's into excitation and emission spectra of each component. PARAFAC also provided relative concentrations of these components. The largest differences between flours were found in the concentration levels of the first and third component. Finally, variations in concentrations of PARAFAC modelled components were analysed in relation to the botanical origin of flour samples."
2009,19589639,"Gallic acid, a major component of Toona sinensis leaf extracts, contains a ROS-mediated anti-cancer activity in human prostate cancer cells.","Prostate cancer, the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in elderly males of the United States, has become a major health issue in Asia. Previous studies have demonstrated that leaf extracts of Toona sinensis Roem. contain cytotoxic activity on several cancer cells including prostate cancer cells. In this study, gallic acid is identified as the major anti-cancer compound in T. sinensis leaf extracts. It is cytotoxic to DU145 prostate cancer cells, through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which were reversed by antioxidants catalase and N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, gallic acid is shown to block the growth of DU145 cells at G2/M phases by activating Chk1 and Chk2 and inhibiting Cdc25C and Cdc2 activities. In addition, gallic acid has a synergistic effect with doxorubicin in suppressing the growth of DU145 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that gallic acid has the potential to be developed into an anti-prostate cancer drug and is worthy of further studies."
2005,15657092,Marked attenuation of production of collagen type I from cardiac fibroblasts by dehydroepiandrosterone.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a type of adrenal steroid. The concentrations of DHEA and its sulfate (DHEA-S) in serum reach a peak between the ages of 25 and 30 yr and thereafter decline steadily. It was reported that DHEA-S concentration in humans is inversely related to death from cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we examined the effects of DHEA on regulation of collagen mRNA and collagen synthesis in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. Treatment with DHEA (10(-6) M) resulted in a significant decrease in procollagen type I mRNA expression compared with controls. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in procollagen type I protein accumulation in the medium and also a significant decrease in procollagen type I protein synthesis in the cellular matrix. Furthermore, to confirm in vitro results, we administered DHEA to Sprague-Dawley rats, which were treated with angiotensin II for 8 wk to induce cardiac damage. Procollagen type I mRNA expression was significantly decreased and cardiac fibrosis significantly inhibited in DHEA-treated rat hearts without lowering the systolic blood pressure. These results strongly indicate that DHEA can directly attenuate collagen type I synthesis at the transcriptional level in vivo and in vitro in cardiac fibroblasts."
2008,18804944,Reversal effect of resveratrol on multidrug resistance in KBv200 cell line.,"A multidrug-resistant clone of human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cells was isolated by stepwise selection on exposure to increasing doses of vincristine. The final clone, KBv200, obtained after ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis showed 156-fold higher resistance to vincristine than KB cells. The cells were also cross-resistant to paclitaxel and adriamycin. The aim of this study was to explore the reversal effect and potential mechanism of resveratrol on KBv200 cells. MTT assay was used to investigate the reversal index of resveratrol to vincristine, adriamycin and paclitaxel. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of multidrug-resistant gene MDR1 and apoptosis-suppressing gene Bcl-2. Resveratrol produced a synergistic effect combined with the chemotherapeutic agents and reversed the multidrug-resistant phenotype of KBv200 cells. Flow cytometry confirmed that the percentage of apoptotic cell increased when KBv200 cells were exposed to resveratrol. The results of gene detection showed that the expression levels of MDR1 and Bcl-2 were decreased upon resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol can efficiently reverse multidrug resistance in KBv200 cells. The potential mechanism may be via inhibiting the multidrug-resistant gene expressions and/or promoting cell apoptosis."
2012,22120676,Berberine-induced AMPK activation inhibits the metastatic potential of melanoma cells via reduction of ERK activity and COX-2 protein expression.,"Berberine is clinically important natural isoquinoline alkaloid that affects various biological functions, such as cell proliferation, migration and survival. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates tumor cell migration. However, the specific role of AMPK on the metastatic potential of cancer cells remains largely unknown. The present study investigated whether berberine induces AMPK activation and whether this induction directly affects mouse melanoma cell migration, adhesion and invasion. Berberine strongly increased AMPK phosphorylation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a well-known AMPK activator, also inhibited tumor cell adhesion and invasion and reduced the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Knockdown of AMPKα subunits using siRNAs significantly abated the berberine-induced inhibition of tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, berberine inhibited the metastatic potential of melanoma cells through a decrease in ERK activity and protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by a berberine-induced AMPK activation. These data were confirmed using specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. Berberine- and AICAR-treated groups demonstrated significantly decreased lung metastases in the pulmonary metastasis model in vivo. Treatment with berberine also decreased the metastatic potential of A375 human melanoma cells. Collectively, our results suggest that berberine-induced AMPK activation inhibits the metastatic potential of tumor cells through a reduction in the activity of the ERK signaling pathway and COX-2 protein levels."
2004,15504753,Effects of grapefruit juice and orange juice components on P-glycoprotein- and MRP2-mediated drug efflux.,"We investigated the effects of grapefruit juice (GFJ) and orange juice (OJ) on drug transport by MDR1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), which are efflux transporters expressed in human small intestine. We examined the transcellular transport and uptake of [(3)H]vinblastine (VBL) and [(14)C]saquinavir in a human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) and in porcine kidney epithelial cell lines transfected with human MDR1 cDNA and human MRP2 cDNA, LLC-GA5-COL150, and LLC-MRP2, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, the basal-to-apical transports of [(3)H]VBL and [(14)C]saquinavir were greater than those in the opposite direction. The ratio of basal-to-apical transport to apical-to-basal transport of [(3)H]VBL and [(14)C]saquinavir by Caco-2 cells was reduced in the presence of MK571 (MRPs inhibitor), verapamil (P-gp inhibitor), cyclosporin A (inhibitor of both), 50% ethyl acetate extracts of GFJ and OJ, or their components (6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, bergamottin, tangeretin, hepatomethoxyflavone, and nobiletin). Studies of transport and uptake of [(3)H]VBL and [(14)C]saquinavir with MDR1 and MRP2 transfectants showed that VBL and saquinavir are transported by both P-gp and MRP2. GFJ and OJ components inhibited the transport by MRP2 as well as P-gp. However, their inhibitory potencies for P-gp or MRP2 were substrate-dependent. The present study has revealed that GFJ and OJ interact with not only P-gp but also MRP2, both of which are expressed at apical membranes and limit the apical-to-basal transport of VBL and saquinavir in Caco-2 cells."
2008,18981565,Biological and antibacterial activities of the natural herb Houttuynia cordata water extract against the intracellular bacterial pathogen salmonella within the RAW 264.7 macrophage.,"Salmonellosis is a major bacterial zoonosis that causes a variety of disease syndromes, from self-limiting enteritis to fatal infection in animals and food-borne infection and typhoid fever in humans. Recently, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella sp. has caused more serious problems in public health. The present study investigated the antibacterial effects of Houttuynia cordata water extract (HCWE) against murine salmonellosis. In RAW 264.7 cells, there was no detectable cytotoxic effect of HCWE at any concentration between 25 and 100 microg/ml after 8-h incubation. The antibacterial activity of HCWE was then examined in a Salmonella enterica serovar (Salmonella typhimurium), and was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 25 to 100 microg/ml during 8-h incubation. HCWE also affected RAW 264.7 cells including morphologic change and bacterial uptake, but there was no significant difference in bacterial replication in RAW 264.7 cells. With HCWE alone, nitric oxide (NO) production by RAW 264.7 cells did not increase, but when RAW 264.7 cells were infected by S. typhimurium, with or without HCWE, NO production with HCWE was 2-fold higher than that without HCWE. Treatment with HCWE did not affect inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by RAW 264.7 cells, but when RAW 264.7 cells with HCWE were infected by S. typhimurium, iNOS mRNA expression was increased during 8-h incubation. Furthermore, HCWE showed virulence reduction effects in S. typhimurium-infected BALB/c mice. After a lethal dose of S. typhimurium, the mortality rate in the HCWE untreated group was 100% at 7 d, but the HCWE 25, 50, and 100 microg/ml groups survived until 11, 17, and 23 d, respectively. These data suggest that HCWE is stable and beneficial in the treatment of bacterial infection including intracellularly replicating pathogens and may solve antimicrobial misuse and overuse."
2017,28585494,Recombinant protein expression of Moringa oleifera lectin in methylotrophic yeast as active coagulant for sustainable high turbid water treatment.,"The natural coagulant Moringa oleifera lectin (MoL) as cationic protein is a promising candidate in coagulation process of water treatment plant. Introducing the gene encoding MoL into a host, Pichia pastoris, to secrete soluble recombinant protein is assessed in this study. Initial screening using PCR confirmed the insertion of MoL gene, and SDS-PAGE analysis detected the MoL protein at 8 kDa. Cultured optimization showed the highest MoL protein at 520 mg/L was observed at 28 °C for 144 h of culturing by induction in 1% methanol. Approximately, 0.40 mg/mL of recombinant MoL protein showed 95 ± 2% turbidity removal of 1% kaolin suspension. In 0.1% kaolin suspension, the concentration of MoL at 10 μg/mL exhibits the highest turbidity reduction at 68 ± 1%. Thus, recombinant MoL protein from P. pastoris is an effective coagulant for water treatment."
2002,11835325,Supplemental peripheral blood stem cells to decrease marrow rejection in adult patients with severe aplastic anemia.,"Twenty-two multi-transfused patients with a long duration of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) received a transplant from an HLA-matched donor after cyclophosphamide (CY) plus antithymocyte globulin plus procarbazine using CD34(+) enriched blood stem cells + fresh marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected on days 5 and 6 of G-CSF (10 microg/kg/day), and T cells were depleted using an immunoadsorption column (n = 15) or magnetic cell sorting (n = 7). Marrow harvesting was performed 48 hr after the last leukapheresis. Two patients (9.1%) that developed graft failure had a successful engraftment again using unpurged PBSC. Median time to neutrophils > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelets > or = 20 x 10(9)/l without platelet transfusions were 12 days and 17 days, respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II occurred in four of 22 patients. No patient developed grade III or IV acute GVHD. Four of the evaluable 21 patients had chronic GVHD. One patient developed extensive disease. Three patients (13.6%) died from CY-induced heart failure, extensive-type chronic GVHD, and sepsis of unknown cause. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 83.9% (95% CI, 70.1-95.2%) with a median follow-up duration of 33.5 (6-44) months. CD34(+)-enriched PBSC in combination with unmanipulated marrow seem to play a role in overcoming the sensitization to histocompatibility antigens without an apparent increase in GVHD. The stem cell component therapy may be feasible for the high-risk SAA adult patients."
2012,26434316,Regulation of lipid disorders by ethanol extracts from Zingiber zerumbet in high-fat diet-induced rats.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the antihyperlipidaemic effects of the ethanol extract of Zingiber zerumbet (L) Smith (EEZZ). After being fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2weeks, rats were dosed orally with EEZZ (100, 200 or 300mg/kg) or fenofibrate (100mg/kg) once daily for 8weeks. EEZZ (300mg/kg/day) produced effects similar to fenofibrate in reducing body weight gain, visceral fat-pad weights and plasma lipid levels. EEZZ caused reductions in hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol content, and lowered hepatic lipid droplet accumulation and the size of epididymal adipocytes. HFD-induced reductions in the hepatic proteins of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and cytochrome P450 isoform 4A1 (CYP4A1) were reversed by EEZZ. These results suggest that EEZZ reduced the accumulation of visceral fat and improved hyperlipidaemia in HFD-fed rats by increasing fatty acid oxidation, an effect which is likely to be mediated via up-regulation of hepatic PPARα."
2019,31306972,Berberine improves intestinal epithelial tight junctions by upregulating A20 expression in IBS-D mice.,"To investigate effects of berberine exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial tight junctions via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 IEC-KO mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), rifaximin and berberine groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of IBS-D was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. rifaximin and berberine mice were treated with rifaximin and berberine, respectively. Intestinal epithelial space of WT berberine mice improved more than A20 IEC-KO berberine mice compared to MC mice. WT berberine mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice(P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 IEC-KO and WT berberine mice were all decreased compared to MC mice(P all<0.05). NF-κB p65, MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice as compared to WT berberine mice (P all<0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all berberine mice (P all<0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice(P < 0.05). Berberine downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of IBS-D, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial tight junctions and repairing the damage IBS-D causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier."
2014,24176371,The modulation of pancreatic lipase activity by alginates.,"Alginates are comprised of mannuronic (M) and guluronic acid (G) and have been shown to inhibit enzyme activity. Pancreatic lipase is important in dietary triacylglycerol breakdown; reducing pancreatic lipase activity would reduce triacylglycerol breakdown resulting in lower amounts being absorbed by the body. Lipase activity in the presence of biopolymers was assessed by enzymatic assay using natural and synthetic substrates. Alginate inhibited pancreatic lipase by a maximum of 72.2% (±4.1) with synthetic substrate (DGGR) and 58.0% (±9.7) with natural substrate. High-G alginates from Laminaria hyperborea seaweed inhibited pancreatic lipase to a significantly higher degree than High-M alginates from Lessonia nigrescens, showing that inhibition was related to alginate structure. High-G alginates are effective inhibitors of pancreatic lipase and are used in the food industry at low levels. They could be included at higher levels in foods without altering organoleptic qualities, potentially reduce the uptake of dietary triacylglycerol aiding in weight management. "
2010,20868663,Berberine regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and positive transcription elongation factor b expression in diabetic adipocytes.,"Berberine has hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects on diabetic rats. This study investigated the relationship between hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of berberine and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (including cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1) in white adipose tissue of diabetic rats and RNA interference-treated 3T3-L1 cells. Berberine promoted differentiation and inhibited lipid accumulation of 3T3-L1 cells, further decreased PPARα/δ/γ, CDK9 and cyclin T1 mRNA and protein expression and decreased tumor necrosis factor α content in supernatants of both control and RNA interference-treated 3T3-L1 cells. After a 16-week induction with 35 mg/kg streptozotocin (i.p.) and high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet, diabetic rats were treated with 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg berberine and 100 mg/kg fenofibrate or 4 mg/kg rosiglitazone for another 16 weeks. Berberine decreased white adipose tissue to body weight ratio and adipocyte size and increased adipocyte number. Berberine upregulated PPARα/δ/γ, CDK9 and cyclin T1 mRNA and protein expression in adipose tissue, decreased tumor necrosis factor α and free fatty acid content and increased lipoprotein lipase activity in serum and adipose tissue. Berberine modulated metabolic related PPARs expression and differentiation related P-TEFb expression in adipocytes, which are associated with its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects."
1993,8316545,[Phlebitis following travel].,"The term of economy class syndrome has been used to describe the deep vein thrombosis which may follow air travel. The mechanisms suggested for this include tendency to clot formation in the legs secondary to the reduced venous return induced by the sitting position with direct compression of popliteal and femoral veins, and secondary to dehydration and haemo-concentration. However, these conditions are also observed with others means of transport. We describe 16 patients with deep vein thrombosis following travel by bus, car, truck and train. These 16 patients represent 3.4 percent of 465 patients with thromboembolism managed over a 52-month period in our department. All but one patients had one or more risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. The mean duration of the trip was 14.2 hours and the first symptom occurred less than a week after the journey in 75 percent of the patients. These first symptoms suggested deep vein thrombosis in 8, pulmonary embolism in 5, and deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism in 3 patients. Regular non alcoholic drinks and regular walks seem to be sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis in the great majority of travellers. However, low dose heparin on a temporary basis or elastic stockings could be considered in high risk subjects."
2017,28780467,In vitro schistosomicidal and antiviral activities of Arctium lappa L. (Asteraceae) against Schistosoma mansoni and Herpes simplex virus-1.,"Schistosomiasis and herpes diseases represent serious issues to the healthcare systems, infecting a large number of people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. Arctium lappa L. (Asteraceae), known as ""bardana"" and ""burdock"", is a medicinal plant popularly used for several purposes, including as antiseptic. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro schistosomicidal and antiherpes activities of the crude extract of A. lappa, which have not yet been described. Fruits of A. lappa L. were extracted by maceration with ethanol: H2O (96:4 v/v) in order to obtain the hydroalcoholic extract of A. lappa (AL). In vitro schistosomicidal assays were assessed against adult worms of Schistosoma mansoni, while the in vitro antiviral activity of AL was evaluated on replication of Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1). Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, using Vero cells and chemical composition of AL was determined by qualitative UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis. UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis of AL revealed the presence of dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans, such as arctiin and arctigenin. Results showed that AL was not cytotoxic to Vero cells even when tested at 400μg/mL. qPCR results indicated a significant viral load decreased for all tested concentrations of AL (400, 50, and 3.125μg/mL), which showed similar antiviral effect to acyclovir (50μg/mL) when tested at 400μg/mL. Also, AL (400, 200, and 100μg/mL) caused 100% mortality and significantly reduction on motor activity of all adult worms of S. mansoni. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed tegumental morphological alterations and changes on the numbers of tubercles of S. mansoni worms in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with AL. This report provides the first evidence for the in vitro schistosomicidal and antiherpes activities of AL, opening the route to further schistosomicidal and antiviral studies with AL and their compounds, especially lignans."
2016,27297790,Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for HIV-related lymphoma: results of the BMT CTN 0803/AMC 071 trial.,"Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) for HIV-infected patients is largely limited to centers with HIV-specific expertise. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 0803/AIDS Malignancy Consortium 071 trial is a multicenter phase 2 study of AHCT for patients with HIV-related lymphoma (HRL). Eligible patients had chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed/persistent HRL, were >15 years of age, and had treatable HIV infection. Patients were prepared using carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan and received consistent management of peritransplant antiretroviral treatment. The primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival. Forty-three patients were enrolled; 40 underwent AHCT. Pretransplant HIV viral load was undetectable (<50 copies/mL) in 32 patients (80%); the median CD4 count was 249/μL (range, 39-797). At a median follow-up of 24.8 months, 1-year and 2-year overall survival probabilities were 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.1-94.5) and 82% (95% CI, 65.9-91), respectively. The probability of 2-year progression-free survival was 79.8% (95% CI, 63.7-89.4). One-year transplant-related mortality was 5.2%. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 11 days and 18 days, respectively. Nine patients experienced a total of 13 unexpected grade 3-5 adverse events posttransplant (10 grade 3 and 3 grade 4 events). Twenty-two patients had at least 1 infectious episode posttransplant. At 1 year post-AHCT, median CD4(+) T-cell count was 280.3 (range, 28.8-1148.0); 82.6% had an undetectable HIV viral load. Trial patients were compared with 151 matched Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research controls. Outcomes between HIV-infected patients and controls were not statistically significantly different. HRL patients should be considered candidates for AHCT if they meet standard transplant criteria. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01141712."
2011,20428964,Testicular histomorphometry and ultrastructure of rats treated with cadmium and Ginkgo biloba.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the association of a single low dose of Cd and daily doses of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on the testis and accessory glands of rats. The animals were treated with a single dose of 3 µmol/kg body weight of cadmium chloride (CdCl₂) and/or 100 mg/kg body weight of GbE. The plasma testosterone levels; corporal, testicular, and accessory glands weight; gonadosomatic index, volumetric proportion; and absolute volume of testicular components did not change after the treatments. CdCl₂ caused significant reduction in Leydig cells volume and altered Leydig cell morphology, as well as vacuolated Sertoli cells cytoplasm, irregular chromatin condensation of late spermatids, and modified acrosome formation. However, animals that received GbE did not show these alterations. The reversal of Cd-induced alterations by the extract is a strong indication that G. biloba is helpful in diminishing the effect of Cd toxicity."
2018,29359978,"Effect of metoclopramide treatment of bitches during the first week of lactation on serum prolactin concentration, milk composition, and milk yield and on weight gain of their puppies.","OBJECTIVE To investigate effects of metoclopramide orally administered to healthy bitches on serum prolactin and milk lactose concentrations, gross energy, and dry matter content and on puppy weight gain during early lactation. ANIMALS 20 client-owned bitches and their 121 puppies. PROCEDURES 10 bitches received metoclopramide (0.2 mg/kg, PO, q 6 h for 6 days; treatment group) starting 10 to 24 hours after birth of the last puppy of the litter (day 0), and 10 bitches served as the control group. Blood and milk samples from all bitches were collected on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. Milk samples for days 1 and 2 and days 4 and 6 were pooled because of small volume. Puppies were weighed twice daily. RESULTS Serum prolactin concentration increased significantly over time in both groups, and no treatment effect was detected. When day-to-day changes were analyzed, the prolactin concentration increased from day 0 to day 1 in the treatment group but not in the control group. Milk lactose concentration increased significantly and was higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Milk dry matter content was unchanged, whereas the time course for milk gross energy content differed significantly between treatment and control bitches. Puppy weight gain was not affected by metoclopramide treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Oral administration of metoclopramide to healthy bitches after parturition induced a transient increase in serum prolactin concentration and stimulated milk lactose production. It is likely bitches with insufficient or delayed milk production could benefit from metoclopramide treatment."
2017,28241761,Antimalarial activity of Garcinia mangostana L rind and its synergistic effect with artemisinin in vitro.,"Malaria especially falciparum malaria still causes high morbidity and mortality in tropical countries. Several factors have been linked to this situation and the most important one is the rapid spread of parasite resistance to the currently available antimalarials, including artemisinin. Artemisinin is the main component of the currently recommended antimalarial, artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT), and it is a free radical generating antimalarial. Garcinia mangostana L (mangosteen) rind contain a lot of xanthone compounds acting as an antioxidant and exhibited antimalarial activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimalarial activity of mangosteen rind extract and its fractions and their interaction with artemisinin against the 3D7 clone of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro.Dry ripe mangosteen rind was extracted with ethanol followed by fractionation with hexane, ethylacetate, buthanol, and water consecutively to get ethanol extract, hexane, athylacetate, buthanol, and water fractions. Each of these substances was diluted in DMSO and examined for antimalarial activity either singly or in combination with artemisinin in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 clone. Synergism between these substances with artemisinin was evaluated according to certain formula to get the sum of fractional inhibitory concentration 50 (∑FIC50).Analysis of the parasite growth in vitro indicated that IC50 of these mangosteen rind extract, hexane, ethylacetate, buthanol, and water fraction ranged from 0.41 to > 100 μg/mL. All of the ∑FIC50 were <1.This study demonstrated a promising antimalarial activity of the extract and fractions of G.mangostana L rind and its synergistic effect with artemisinin. Further study using lead compound(s) isolated from extract and fractions should be performed to identify more accurately their mechanism of antimalarial activities."
2012,22754463,Genotoxicity of silver nanoparticles in Vicia faba: a pilot study on the environmental monitoring of nanoparticles.,"The use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in commercial products has increased significantly in recent years. Although there have been some attempts to determine the toxic effects of AgNPs in mammalian and human cell-lines, there is little information on plants which play a vital role in ecosystems. The study reports the use of Vicia faba root-tip meristem to investigate the genotoxicity of AgNPs under modified GENE-TOX test conditions. The root tip cells of V. faba were treated with four different concentrations of engineered AgNPs dispersion to study toxicological endpoints such as mitotic index (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus induction (MN). For each concentration, five sets of microscopy observations were carried out. The results demonstrated that AgNPs exposure significantly increased (p < 0.05) the number of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and decreased the MI in exposed groups compared to control. From this study we infer that AgNPs might have penetrated the plant system and may have impaired mitosis causing CA and MN. The results of this study demonstrate that AgNPs are genotoxic to plant cells. Since plant assays have been integrated as a genotoxicity component in risk assessment for detection of environmental mutagens, they should be given full consideration when evaluating the overall toxicological impact of the nanoparticles in the environment."
2019,30611751,Quality and In-Use Stability Comparison of Brand and Generics of Extended-Release Phenytoin Sodium Capsules.,"The objective of the present study was to understand quality of brand and generic products of phenytoin sodium by in vitro methods. Three commercial products were selected for the study, 1 brand and 2 generics (product-A, product-B, and product-C). Products were repacked in pharmacy vials and stored for 12 weeks at 30°C/75% RH to simulate in-use conditions. The products were examined visually and microscopically for morphologic changes, spectroscopic and diffractometric methods for chemical changes, and dissolution, assay, and impurities for performance evaluation. Capsules content of the product-A turned yellowish to dark orange color from initial white powder, which indicated a possible chemical interaction between lactose and the drug in addition to disproportionation. This was supported by pH, microscopic, spectroscopic, and X-ray diffraction data. Product-A failed to meet United States Pharmacopoeia dissolution specification of 75% in 120 min after 2-weeks whereas product-B and product-C failed at 6-weeks of in-use stability conditions exposure. Furthermore, product-A also failed to meet United States pharmacopoeia assay and impurities specifications in 12 weeks in-use period. In summary, this study indicated salt disproportionation, chemical interactions, and phase transformations of drug and excipients in the commercial products of phenytoin sodium, which may affect the clinical performance of the product."
2005,15684488,Inhibition of human lanosterol synthase by the constituents of Colocasia esculenta (taro).,"Ethanol extracts of lyophilized vegetables were tested for inhibition of human lanosterol synthase (hOSC) in order to find the compounds to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis. Of 130 samples tested, twelve samples showed significant inhibition. Among them, Colocasia esculenta (taro) showed the highest inhibition (55% inhibition at 300 microg/ml). Examination of activity variation among eight taro cultivars indicated that ""Aichi-wase"" and ""Yatsugashira"" had the most potent activity for hOSC inhibition. In order to identify the active constituent of taro, ethanol extracts of ""Aichi-wase"" were partitioned with hexane and aqueous methanol, and fractionated by silica gel column chromatography. Inhibitory activity was concentrated in two major active fractions. Further purification of these fractions by preparative HPLC gave three monogalactosyldiacylglycerols and five digalactosyldiacylglycerols as active compounds that showed 28 to 67% inhibitory activities at the concentration 300 microg/ml."
,11205266,Biological activity of feijoa peel extracts.,"Fractionated extracts of Feijoa peels were studied for cytotoxic activity, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity and antibacterial activity. Two most cytotoxic fractions A3 of acetone extract and M2 of methanol extract had potent inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi tested. Fraction A4 of acetone extract showed multidrug resistance (MDR)-reversal activity comparable with that of verapamil (positive control). These results indicate the therapeutic value of Feijoa peel extracts as potential antimicrobial and MDR-modulating agents."
2015,25277680,Spray-by-spray in situ cross-linking alginate hydrogels delivering a tea tree oil microemulsion.,"In this paper we propose an in situ forming ionically cross-linked alginate (Alg) hydrogel delivering a Tea Tree Oil microemulsion (MeTTO) and potentially useful as an advanced dressing for infected wounds. Alg hydrogels were prepared by a spray-by-spray deposition method with the aim to minimize the discomforts during application. From pseudoternary phase diagrams, it was found that proper combination of TTO, water, polysorbate 80 and ethanol gave stable spherical MeTTO with good antimicrobial activity. On this basis, MeTTO at 20% TTO was selected for further inclusion in an Alg hydrogel prepared by alternating sprays of Alg/MeTTO and calcium chloride solutions. Homogeneous dispersion of MeTTO inside cross-linked Alg was assessed by different macroscopic and microscopic methods demonstrating the superior propensity of MeTTO to be integrated in the water-based hydrogel as compared to TTO. Antimicrobial effect of Alg/MeTTO hydrogels on Escherichia Coli strains was remarkable, highlighting the potential of the system as bioactive wound dressing. "
2007,17955831,[Oral anticoagulation and pharmacogenetics: importance in the clinical setting].,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9) and Vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit I (VKORC1) make a significant contribution to the inter-individual variability in the maintenance dose of vitamin K antagonists (warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon). Doses requirements in CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 heterozygotes are reduced by 8-16% and 20-36%, respectively. SNP g-1639a in VKORC1 is also associated with vitamin K antagonists dosage since heterozygotes ga and homozygotes aa require respectively 21-28% and 27-56% less warfarin or acenocoumarol than homozygotes gg. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 account for up to half the variability in vitamin K antagonists requirements and incorporating genotying data for these two genes into dosing algorithms could lead to a safer anticoagulation therapy."
1997,9037451,Detection of DNA damage in stimulated human lymphocytes after adding cytostatic drugs in vitro. A model to demonstrate individual damage rates.,"The DNA damaging effect of different concentrations of methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine and cisplatin was tested by nucleoid sedimentation in pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated lymphocytes of 16 healthy persons in vitro. The examined persons show an individual variation of DNA damage demonstrating individual differences in DNA repair. The method can be used to identify persons with a low DNA repair capacity, and possible cytogenetic side effects of cytostatic drugs can be calculated before starting a cancer therapy. In clinical practice the use of cytostatic drugs is limited because of the side effects on normal tissues. The cancer therapist can improve a cytostatic therapy when he obtains information about possible DNA damage of cytostatic drugs in cells of the patient at the beginning of the therapy."
2013,23870999,Antitumor efficacy of piperine in the treatment of human HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.,"Piperine is a bioactive component of black pepper, Piper nigrum Linn, commonly used for daily consumption and in traditional medicine. Here, the molecular mechanisms by which piperine exerts antitumor effects in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was investigated. The results showed that piperine strongly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, piperine inhibited HER2 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Blockade of ERK1/2 signaling by piperine significantly reduced SREBP-1 and FAS expression. Piperine strongly suppressed EGF-induced MMP-9 expression through inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB activation by interfering with ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt signaling pathways resulting in a reduction in migration. Finally, piperine pretreatment enhanced sensitization to paclitaxel killing in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that piperine may be a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of human breast cancer with HER2 overexpression. "
2011,25212356,Pre-fermentative replacement of sulphur dioxide by lysozyme and oenological tannins: Effect on the formation and evolution of volatile compounds during the bottle storage of white wines.,"In this work, the effects on the volatile profile of the pre-fermentative substitution of SO2 with lysozyme and oenological tannins were studied in white wines. At the same time, in order to understand the changes of volatile compounds in SO2-free wines, the evolution of volatiles was evaluated over 1year of storage in bottles. For this purpose, a number of laboratory scale fermentations of SauvignonBlanc musts were carried out and the effects of three variables (SO2, lysozyme and oenological tannins) were investigated by means of GC-MS analysis. Results showed that the replacement of SO2 with lysozyme and oenological tannins influenced the volatile composition of wines at the end of the alcoholic fermentation. Wines fermented with SO2 showed higher total alcohol amounts, while the presence of oenological tannins augmented the level of esters. The presence of SO2 influenced also the alcohols and esters profiles of wines during bottle storage. Moreover, the presence of oenological tannins displayed a positive role in maintaining the amounts of esters over certain levels in wine stored for 1year, likely due to their oxygen scavenging ability. By contrast, acids were less affected by the investigated adjuvants both at the end of the alcoholic fermentation and during the storage time. "
2018,29518605,Herb-drug interaction of Nisha Amalaki and Curcuminoids with metformin in normal and diabetic condition: A disease system approach.,"Nisha Amalaki (NA), formulation with Curcuma longa Linn (Turmeric, Haridra, Nisha in Sanskrit; Family: Zingiberaceae) and Phyllanthus emblica Linn (Indian gooseberry, Amlaki in Sanskrit; Family: Phyllanthaceae) which is described for various diseases including diabetes in ayurvedic texts and Nighantus. The aim of the present study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions of chemically standardized NA and Curcuminoids (CE) with metformin (MET) in normal and diabetic animals. Oral administration of NA (200 mg/kg) and CE (30 mg/kg) was carried out for seven days followed by co-administration of MET till fifteen days. MET plasma PK parameters including Cmax, AUC0-∞, t1/2, CL and Vd were measured on the eighth day. PD parameters including plasma glucose AUC followed by oral glucose tolerance test, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were measured on the fifteenth day. In normal animals, co-administration of NA + MET and CE + MET resulted in significant increase (p < 0.05) in Cmax, AUC0-∞, t1/2, and reduction of CL and Vd. We report that co-administration of NA + MET and CE + MET significantly (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) reduced plasma glucose level, HDL level while a notable reduction in TG and TC level was observed. Interestingly, in diabetic condition, co-administration of NA + MET and CE + MET indicated a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in Cmax, AUC0-∞, t1/2 and enhanced CL and Vd. Hence, to conclude, co-administration of NA + MET and CE + MET resulted in beneficial PK and PD interactions leading to antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects in both conditions. However, PK interaction was drastically different in diabetic and normal conditions."

Pre-standardized doses (200mg/kg of MI and 100mg/kg both of CV and CM), based on the maximum inhibition in hepatic LPO, were administered to Wistar albino male rats for 10 consecutive days and the changes in tissue (heart, liver and kidney) LPO and in the concentrations of serum triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxin (T(4)), insulin, glucose, alpha-amylase and different lipids were examined. Administration of three test peel extracts significantly increased both the thyroid hormones (T(3) and T(4)) with a concomitant decrease in tissue LPO, suggesting their thyroid stimulatory and antiperoxidative role. This thyroid stimulatory nature was also exhibited in propylthiouracil (PTU) induced hypothyroid animals. However, only minor influence was observed in serum lipid profile in which CM reduced the concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), while CV decreased triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C). When the combined effects of either two (MI+CV) or three (MI+CV+CM) peel extracts were evaluated in euthyroid animals, serum T(3) concentration was increased in response to MI+CV and MI+CV+CM treatments, while T(4) level was elevated by the combinations of first two peels only. Interestingly, both the categories of combinations increased T(4) levels, but not T(3) in PTU treated hypothyroid animals. Moreover, a parallel increase in hepatic and renal LPO was observed in these animals, suggesting their unsafe nature in combination. In conclusion the three test peel extracts appear to be stimulatory to thyroid functions and inhibitory to tissue LPO but only when treated individually."
2019,30236680,Effect of liquid-state fermentation on the antioxidant and functional properties of raw and roasted buckwheat flours.,"The influence of liquid-state fermentation (LSF) by selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Rhizopus oligosporus fungi on the content of rutin and total phenolic compounds (TPC), antioxidant capacity measured by ABTS test, FRAP assay and photochemiluminescence technique, and the inhibitory activity against formation of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in vitro of raw and roasted buckwheat flours was studied. LSF caused a slight, specific LAB-dependent increase in TPC and a decrease in rutin content. Fermented raw buckwheat flours contained higher amounts of rutin and TPC with one exception when the highest increase in TPC was noted in roasted flour fermented by fungi. A LAB-dependent difference in the antioxidant capacity of buckwheat flours was noted while the inhibitory activity of fermented flours against AGEs formation was generally reduced. It can be concluded that LSF with selected LAB and fungi may improve the antioxidant and functional properties of buckwheat flours."
2010,20176905,Anti-Porphyromonas gingivalis and anti-inflammatory activities of A-type cranberry proanthocyanidins.,"A-type cranberry proanthocyanidins (AC-PACs) have recently been reported to be beneficial for human health, especially urinary tract health. The effect of these proanthocyanidins on periodontitis, a destructive disease of tooth-supporting tissues, needs to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AC-PACs on various virulence determinants of Porphyromonas gingivalis as well as on the inflammatory response of oral epithelial cells stimulated by this periodontopathogen. We examined the effects of AC-PACs on P. gingivalis growth and biofilm formation, adherence to human oral epithelial cells and protein-coated surfaces, collagenase activity, and invasiveness. We also tested the ability of AC-PACs to modulate the P. gingivalis-induced inflammatory response by human oral epithelial cells. Our results showed that while AC-PACs neutralized all the virulence properties of P. gingivalis in a dose-dependent fashion, they did not interfere with growth. They also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) but did not affect the secretion of IL-6 by epithelial cells stimulated with P. gingivalis. This anti-inflammatory effect was associated with reduced activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 pathway. AC-PACs may be potentially valuable bioactive molecules for the development of new strategies to treat and prevent P. gingivalis-associated periodontal diseases."
2018,29501769,The efficacy of a lectin from Abelmoschus Esculentus depends on central opioid receptor activation to reduce temporomandibular joint hypernociception in rats.,"Abelmoschus esculentus is largely cultivated in Northeastern Brazil for medicinal purposes, e.g. inflammatory conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Abelmoschus esculentus lectin (AEL) in reducing formalin-induced temporomandibular joint inflammatory hypernociception in rats. The behavioral experiments were performed in male Wistar rats (180-240 g). Rats were pre-treated (i.v.) with AEL (0.001, 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg) 30 min before formalin injection (i.art.). To analyze the possible effect of opioid pathways on AEL efficacy, animals were pre-treated with naloxone or CTOP (μ opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (δ opioid receptor antagonist) or nor-binaltorphimine (κ opioid receptor antagonist) (i.t.) 15 min before AEL administration followed by intra-TMJ injection of 1.5% formalin. Animals were monitored for a 45-min observation period. TMJ tissue, trigeminal ganglion, and subnucleus caudalis were collected for TNF-α dosage (ELISA). In addition, the vascular permeability was evaluated by Evans Blue extravasation. AEL significantly reduced formalin-induced TMJ inflammatory hypernociception and decreased Evans blue extravasation. It decreased TNF-α levels in the TMJ tissue, trigeminal ganglion, and subnucleus caudalis. AEL antinociceptive effects were not observed in the presence of naltrindole or nor-binaltorphimine, suggesting that AEL efficacy depends on TNF-α inhibition and the activation of δ and κ opioid receptors. AEL has provided prominent analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in this pre-clinical model of TMJ, supporting its possible use as a pharmacological tool for the management of painful conditions."
2018,28730576,Effects of Boron Supplementation on Expression of Hsp70 in the Spleen of African Ostrich.,"Increased synthesis of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) occurs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes in response to physiological, environmental, and chemical exposures, thus allowing the cell survival from fatal conditions. Hsp70 cytoprotective properties may be clarified by its anti-apoptotic function. Boron has been reported to play an essential role in various organ developments and metabolisms. However, it is not known if boron is also able to modulate the Hsp70. In the present study, the actions of boron on ostrich spleen and expression level of Hsp70 were investigated. Thirty healthy ostrich chicks were randomly assigned to six groups: groups I, II, III, IV, V, and VI and fed the basal diet spiked with 0-, 40-, 80-, 160-, 320-, and 640-mg boric acid (BA)/L, respectively, in drinking water. The histomorphological examination in the spleen was done by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The expression level of Hsp70 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting, and mRNA expression of Hsp70 was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In order to investigate apoptosis, TUNEL assay reaction in all treatment groups was analyzed. Our results showed that the histological structure of spleen up to 160 mg/L BA supplementation groups well developed. The Hsp70 expression level first induced at low-dose groups (up to group IV) and then inhibited dramatically in high-dose groups (V and VI) while comparing with the group I (0 mg BA). The TUNEL assay reaction revealed that the cell apoptosis amount was decreased in group IV, but in group V and especially in group VI, it was significantly increased (P < 0.01). Taken altogether, proper dietary boron treatment might stimulate ostrich chick spleen development by promoting the Hsp70 expression level and inhibiting apoptosis, while a high amount of boron supplementation would impair the ostrich spleen structure by inhibiting Hsp70 expression level and promoting cell apoptosis."
2005,15667600,Screening of antioxidants from medicinal plants for cardioprotective effect against doxorubicin toxicity.,"Doxorubicin is an important and effective anticancer drug widely used for the treatment of various types of cancer but its clinical use is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Elevated tissue levels of cellular superoxide anion/oxidative stress are a mechanism by which doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Selected medicinal plant extracts were tested for their antioxidant capacity and cardioprotective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardiac myoblasts H9c2 were incubated with the antioxidants ascorbic acid, trolox, N-acetylcysteine or selected medicinal plant extracts including; 1) ethanolic extracts from Curcuma longa L-EtOH Phyllanthus emblica L-EtOH, and Piper rostratum Roxb-EtOH; and 2) water extracts from Curcuma longa L-H2O and Morus alba L-H2O. The cardioprotective effects of these extracts were evaluated by crystal violet cytotoxicity assay. IC50s of doxorubicin were compared in the presence or absence of ascorbic acids, trolox, N-acetylcysteine or plant extracts. Morus alba L-H2O showed the highest antioxidant properties evaluated by ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay. Ascorbic acid and N-acetylcysteine had modest effects on the protection of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity while trolox showed insignificant protective effect. All plant extracts protected cardiac toxicity at different degrees except that Curcuma longa L-EtOH had no protective effect. Phyllanthus emblica-EtOH (100 microg/ml) showed the highest cardioprotective effect (approximately 12-fold doxorubicin IC50 increase). The data demonstrate that antioxidants from natural sources may be useful in the protection of cardiotoxicity in patients who receive doxorubicin."
1999,27393058,Structure-Activity Relationship of Phloroglucinol Compounds from Eucalyptus as Marine Antifoulants.,"Environmental pollution has resulted in the use of organo-tin and organo-copper compounds as antifouling agents being prohibited. Non-toxic natural products are considered to be environmentally friendly antifouling agents. Several phloroglucinol compounds isolated from three species of Eucalyptus have demonstrated strong attachment-inhibiting activity against the blue mussel. In this paper, we discuss the structure-activity relationship of these phloroglucinol compounds on the basis of molecular mechanics calculations. When these compounds were superimposed on each other and the strongest inhibitor was applied as a template, the repulsion energy of the other compounds was proportional to the logarithmic attachment-inhibiting activity. It is concluded that, of the two phloroglucinol rings in sideroxylonal A, ring C is more important, and those compounds that stereochemically and electrostatically resemble the template molecule are more active.

2015,25359200,Organic cation transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction potential between berberine and metformin.,"Berberine, the main active component of the herbal medicine Rhizoma Coptidis, has been reported to have hypoglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects and, therefore, could be combined with metformin therapy. Thus, we assessed the potential drug-drug interactions between berberine and metformin. We investigated the in vitro inhibitory potency of berberine on metformin uptake in HEK293 cells overexpressing organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2. To investigate whether this inhibitory effect of berberine on OCT1 and OCT2 could change the pharmacokinetics of metformin in vivo, we measured the effect of berberine co-administration on the pharmacokinetics of metformin at a single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg metformin and 10 mg/kg berberine. In HEK293 cells, berberine inhibited OCT1- and OCT2-mediated metformin uptake in a concentration dependent manner and IC50 values for OCT1 and OCT2 were 7.28 and 11.3 μM, respectively. Co-administration of berberine increased the initial plasma concentration and AUC of metformin and decreased systemic clearance and volume of distribution of metformin in rats, suggesting that berberine inhibited disposition of metformin, which is governed by OCT1 and OCT2. Berberine inhibited the transport activity of OCT1 and OCT2 and showed significant potential drug-drug interactions with metformin in in vivo rats. "
2009,19371257,Trade herbal products and induction of CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 in cultured human hepatocytes.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the dose-dependent induction potential of six commonly used trade herbal products on CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 metabolic activities in cultured human hepatocytes. S-mephenytoin and chlorzoxazone were used as specific CYP substrates, respectively, and rifampicin was used as a positive induction control for both enzymes. The hepatocytes were exposed to herbal extracts in increasing and biological relevant concentrations for 72 hrs and CYP substrate metabolites were quantified by validated HPLC methodologies. The major findings were that St John's wort was the most potent CYP-modulating herb, showing a dose-dependent induction/inhibition of both CYP2C19 and CYP2E1, with induction at low dosages and inhibition at higher. Ginkgo biloba showed an induction/inhibition profile towards CYP2C19 which was similar but weaker than that observed for St John's wort. If cooperative mechanisms are involved is still an open question. Common sage induced CYP2C19 in a log-linear dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations. Common valerian was a weak inducer of CYP2C19, while horse chestnut and cone flower were characterized as non-inducers of CYP2C19. Only St John's wort showed an inductive effect towards CYP2E1. In addition to St John's wort, Gingko biloba and common sage should be considered as possible candidates for clinically relevant drug-herb interactions with selected CYP2C19 substrates."
2019,30905615,Exploiting gelatin nanocarriers in the pulmonary delivery of methotrexate for lung cancer therapy.,"Gelatin has many merits that encourage its use in the pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs. It is a biodegradable denatured protein which possesses several functional groups that could be modified. Additionally, it has balanced hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters, which facilitate the loading of chemotherapeutic agents. Accordingly, the purpose of the current work was to exploit this valuable biomaterial in the efficient pulmonary delivery of methotrexate in case of lung cancer. Gelatin nanoparticles were prepared via a desolvation method and the fabrication process was optimized using Box Behnken design of experiment. A comparative study on uptake of gelatin nanoparticles by lung adenocarcinoma cells and macrophages was implemented using flow cytometry. Investigation of the effect of different methotrexate loading techniques: encapsulation, post loading and chemical conjugation on the nanoparticles characteristics and cellular cytotoxicity was performed. Nano-in-microparticles were prepared by co-spray drying optimized nanoparticles with leucine. Results showed that Box Behnken design was able to optimize preparation parameters to yield uniform nanoparticles with suitable particle size for cancer cells uptake. The prepared nanoparticles demonstrated a preferential uptake by lung cancer cells. Additionally, methotrexate loaded nanoparticles demonstrated up to four fold significant reduction in methotrexate IC50. The spray dried gelatin nano-in microparticles demonstrated good aerosolization properties enabling lung deposition in the respirable airways. Thus, providing a promising platform for lung cancer therapy."
2012,23155249,Suppression of cell invasion and migration by propofol are involved in down-regulating matrix metalloproteinase-2 and p38 MAPK signaling in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells.,"Metastasis is a major cause of death of patients with malignant tumors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important for the migration and invasion of various types of cancer cell. Propofol is a known anesthetic agent, widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation. Propofol inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells, but there is no available information regarding propofol-inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of propofol on the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assays indicated that propofol inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells in vitro. Gelatin zymographic analysis showed the inhibitory effect of propofol on the activation of expression MMP-2. Western blot analysis also indicated that propofol suppressed the protein expiration of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 (p-JNK1/2), p-p38, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A549 cells. Results from real-time PCR assay also showed that propofol inhibited the mRNA gene expression of MMP-2, -7 and -9, and enhanced that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP2 in A549 cells. Taken together, these data show that propofol inhibits MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein expressions, resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro."
2012,22105178,Diesel exhaust particulate extracts inhibit transcription of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and cell viability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"Endothelial dysfunction precedes cardiovascular disease and is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we tested the hypothesis that diesel exhaust particulate extracts (DEPEs), prepared from a truck run at different speeds and engine loads, would inhibit genomic estrogen receptor activation of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) transcription in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, we examined how DEPEs affect NRF-1-regulated TFAM expression and, in turn, Tfam-regulated mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI, MTCO1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I (NDI) expression as well as cell proliferation and viability. We report that 17β-estradiol (E(2)), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), and raloxifene increased NRF-1 transcription in HUVECs in an ER-dependent manner. DEPEs inhibited NRF-1 transcription, and this suppression was not ablated by concomitant treatment with E(2), 4-OHT, or raloxifene, indicating that the effect was not due to inhibition of ER activity. While E(2) increased HUVEC proliferation and viability, DEPEs inhibited viability but not proliferation. Resveratrol increased NRF-1 transcription in an ER-dependent manner in HUVECs, and ablated DEPE inhibition of basal NRF-1 expression. Given that NRF-1 is a key nuclear transcription factor regulating genes involved in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis, these data suggest that DEPEs may adversely affect mitochondrial function leading to endothelial dysfunction and resveratrol may block these effects."
2013,23750556,"Up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) and autophagy-related genes by repeated treatments with resveratrol in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.","Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in red wine and various plants, has been reported to up-regulate the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). However, this effect was neither long term in nature nor physiologically relevant at the concentration of resveratrol studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects of repeated treatments with a lower concentration of resveratrol on the expression of genes in HUVEC. The expression levels of eNOS and silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) were up-regulated in HUVEC by repeated treatments with 1 μM-resveratrol for 6 d, but not with fenofibrate. Moreover, resveratrol treatment increased the expression of autophagy-regulated genes such as γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) and autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3), the radical scavenger activity-related metallothionein-1X (MT1X) gene and the anti-inflammatory activity-related annexin A2 (ANXA) gene. In addition, resveratrol treatment down-regulated the expression of the cell-cycle checkpoint control RAD9 homologue B (RAD9B) gene. These results indicate the beneficial effects of resveratrol on the cardiovascular system."
2003,14534150,Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits phenylephrine-induced vascular contraction through induction of nitric oxide synthase.,"Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) isolated from Panax ginseng relaxes vessels and exerts a cytoprotective effect. In view of the fact that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in vascular hyporeactivity and immunostimulation, the effects of total ginsenosides (GS) and Rg3 on the vascular responses and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were investigated. Vasocontraction of endothelium-denuded aortic ring was induced by phenylephrine with or without GS or Rg3. The expression of iNOS was assessed by Western blot and RT-PCR analyses. NF-kappaB activation was monitored by gel shift, immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. Incubation of the endothelium-denuded aortic ring with GS or Rg3 inhibited phenylephrine-induced vasocontraction, which was abrogated by NOS inhibition. GS or Rg3 increased NO production in aortic rings, but Rb1, Rc, Re and Rg1 had no effect. Aortic rings obtained from rats treated with GS or Rg3 responded to phenylnephrine to a lesser extent, while producing NO to a larger extent, than those from control animals. GS or Rg3 induced iNOS in vascular smooth muscle. Rg3 induced iNOS with increase in NO production in Raw264.7 cells. Rg3 increased NF-kappaB DNA binding, whose band was supershifted with anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies, and elicited p65 nuclear translocation, which was accompanied by phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaBalpha. PKC regulated iNOS induction by Rg3. In conclusion, Rg3 relaxes vessels as a consequence of NO production, to which iNOS induction contributes, and iNOS induction by Rg3 accompanied NF-kappaB activation, which involves phosphorylation and degradation of I-kappaBalpha and nuclear translocation of p65."
2006,15885895,"Bioactivation of 3-aminobenzanthrone, a human metabolite of the environmental pollutant 3-nitrobenzanthrone: evidence for DNA adduct formation mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes and peroxidases.","3-Nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) is a suspected human carcinogen found in diesel exhaust and ambient air pollution. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was detected in the urine of salt mining workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions. We evaluated the role of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the activation of 3-ABA in vivo by treating hepatic cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR)-null mice and wild-type littermates intraperitoneally with 0.2 and 2mg/kg body weight of 3-ABA. Hepatic POR-null mice lack POR-mediated CYP enzyme activity in the liver. Using the (32)P-postlabelling method, multiple 3-ABA-derived DNA adducts were observed in liver DNA from wild-type mice, qualitatively similar to those formed in incubations using human hepatic microsomes. The adduct pattern was also similar to those formed by the nitroaromatic counterpart 3-NBA and which derive from reductive metabolites of 3-NBA bound to purine bases in DNA. DNA binding by 3-ABA in the livers of the null mice was undetectable at the lower dose and substantially reduced (by up to 80%), relative to wild-type mice, at the higher dose. These data indicate that POR-mediated CYP enzyme activities are important for the oxidative activation of 3-ABA in livers, confirming recent results indicating that CYP1A1 and -1A2 are mainly responsible for the metabolic activation of 3-ABA in human hepatic microsomes. No difference in DNA binding was found in kidney and bladder between null and wild-type mice, suggesting that cells in these extrahepatic organs have the metabolic capacity to oxidize 3-ABA to species forming the same 3-ABA-derived DNA adducts, independently from the CYP-mediated oxidation in the liver. We determined that different model peroxidases are able to catalyse DNA adduct formation by 3-ABA in vitro. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), lactoperoxidase (LPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) were all effective in activating 3-ABA in vitro, forming DNA adducts qualitatively similar to those formed in vivo in mice treated with 3-ABA and to those found in DNA reacted with N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-ABA). Collectively, these results suggest that both CYPs and peroxidases may play an important role in metabolizing 3-ABA to reactive DNA adduct forming species."
2015,25529712,"Characterisation of fatty acid, carotenoid, tocopherol/tocotrienol compositions and antioxidant activities in seeds of three Chenopodium quinoa Willd. genotypes.","Composition of fatty acids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids, and their contribution to antioxidant activities were investigated in seeds of three coloured quinoa cultivars (white, red and black). The major components and individual compounds were significantly different, and their concentrations were higher in darker seeds (p < 0.05). The oil yield was 6.58-7.17% which contained predominantly unsaturated fatty acids (89.42%). The ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid was ca. 6/1. The total tocopherol content ranged from 37.49 to 59.82 μg/g and mainly consisted of γ-tocopherol. Trace amount of α- and β-tocotrienols was also found. Black quinoa had the highest vitamin E followed by red and white quinoas. Carotenoids, mainly trans-lutein (84.7-85.6%) and zeaxanthin were confirmed for the first time in quinoa seeds, and the concentration was also the highest in black seeds. The antioxidant activities of lipophilic extracts were positively correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acids, total carotenoids and total tocopherols."
2003,12789870,Niacin for dyslipidemia: considerations in product selection.,"The efficacy and safety profiles of various forms of niacin for treating dyslipidemia are described. Niacin is well recognized for treating dyslipidemia in adults and has been shown to be effective in reducing coronary events. It has a broad range of effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins, including lowering total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Niacin is the most effective lipid-modifying drug for raising high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and has been shown to lower Lp(a) lipoprotein. Niacin reduces triglycerides and very-low-density-lipoprotein and LDL cholesterol synthesis, primarily by decreasing fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue. Niacin appears to raise HDL cholesterol by reducing hepatic apolipoprotein A-l clearance and enhancing reverse cholesterol transport. Niacin is metabolized through a conjugation or nicotinamide pathway. Standard immediate-release niacin is metabolized primarily through the conjugation pathway, which results in a high frequency of flushing. Long-acting niacin is metabolized through the nicotinamide pathway, which results in less flushing but increases the risk of hepatotoxicity. Extended-release niacin has a more balanced metabolism and causes fewer of both types of adverse effects. Improved serum lipid levels during niacin therapy have been associated with clinical and angiographic evidence of reduced coronary artery disease, especially when combined with statins. Niacin is particularly useful for managing high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels as well as the lipid abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome, including those commonly encountered in patients with diabetes. Several niacin products are available with significant differences in their safety and efficacy profiles. Health care providers must consider the differences between agents when recommending niacin for dyslipidemia treatment."
2019,29745257,Beneficial effects of Urtica dioica on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rats: protection against acetylcholinesterase activity and neuronal oxidative damage.,"This study was conducted to investigate protective effects of Urtica dioica extract on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and the oxidative damage of brain tissues in scopolamine-induced memory impairment model. The rats were treated with (1) saline (control), (2) scopolamine, and (3-5) the plant extract (20, 50, or 100 mg/kg) before scopolamine. The traveled distance and the latency to find the platform in Morris water maze (MWM) by scopolamine-treated group were longer while the time spent in target quadrant was shorter than those of the control. Scopolamine decreased the latency to enter the dark in passive avoidance test. Besides, it also increased AChE activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in the hippocampal and cortical tissues while decreased thiols content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in the brain (p < 0.01-p <0.001). Treatment by the extract reversed all the effects of scopolamine (p < 0.05-p <0.001). According to the results of present study, the beneficial effects of U. dioica on memory can be attributed to its protective effects on oxidative damage of brain tissue and AChE activity."
2013,23122087,HPLC confirmatory method development for the determination of seven quinolones in salmon tissue (Salmo salar L.) validated according to the European Union Decision 2002/657/EC.,"A confirmatory high pressure liquid chromatographic method for the determination of seven quinolone antibiotics in tissue of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) was developed. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), danofloxacin (DAN), enrofloxacin (ENR), sarafloxacin (SAR), oxolinic acid (OXO), nalidixic acid (NAL) and flumequine (FLU) were separated on a Perfectsil ODS-2 120 (250 mm × 4 mm, 5 μm) column by gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH=1), acetonitrile and methanol at 25°C within 22 min. Analytes were monitored at 255 nm (for the determination of OXO, NAL and FLU) and 275 nm (for CIP, DAN, ENR and SAR) by means of photodiode array detector. Examined quinolones were isolated from salmon tissue by extraction with citrate buffer solution (pH=4.7) and purified by solid phase extraction using Oasis HLB (200mg/6 mL) cartridges. The developed method was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, stability and sensitivity according to the European Union Decision 2002/657/EC. The accuracy of the method was additionally proved by its application to certified reference material of salmon tissue (BCR® 725)."
2001,11557126,"Toxicological relevance of the multidrug resistance protein 1, MRP1 (ABCC1) and related transporters.","The 190 kDa multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is a founding member of a subfamily of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins and was originally identified on the basis of its elevated expression in multidrug resistant lung cancer cells. In addition to its ability to confer resistance in tumour cells, MRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues and is a primary active transporter of GSH, glucuronate and sulfate conjugated and unconjugated organic anions of toxicological relevance. Substrates include lipid peroxidation products, herbicides, tobacco specific nitrosamines, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and natural product and antifolate anti-cancer agents. MRP1 also transports unmodified xenobiotics but often requires GSH to do so. Active efflux is generally an important aspect of cellular detoxification since it prevents the accumulation of conjugated and unconjugated compounds that have the potential to be directly toxic. The related transporters MRP2 and MRP3 have overlapping substrate specificities with MRP1 but different tissue distributions, and evidence that they also have chemoprotective functions are discussed. Finally, MRP homologues have been described in other species including yeast and nematodes. Those isolated from the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMRPs) decrease the cytoplasmic concentration of conjugated toxins through sequestration in vacuoles and are implicated in providing herbicide resistance to plants."
2011,21501145,Contrasting actions of diesel exhaust particles on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems and the effects of thymoquinone.,"Acute exposure to particulate air pollution has been linked to acute cardiopulmonary events, but the underlying mechanisms are uncertain. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We investigated the acute (at 4 and 18 h) effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on cardiopulmonary parameters in mice and the protective effect of thymoquinone, a constituent of Nigella sativa. Mice were given, intratracheally, either saline (control) or DEP (30 µg·per mouse). KEY RESULTS At 18 h (but not 4 h) after giving DEP, there was lung inflammation and loss of lung function. At both 4 and 18 h, DEP caused systemic inflammation characterized by leucocytosis, increased IL-6 concentrations and reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was decreased only at 18 h. DEP reduced platelet numbers and aggravated in vivo thrombosis in pial arterioles. In vitro, addition of DEP (0.1-1 µg·mL(-1)) to untreated blood-induced platelet aggregation. Pretreatment of mice with thymoquinone prevented DEP-induced decrease of SBP and leucocytosis, increased IL-6 concentration and decreased plasma SOD activity. Thymoquinone also prevented the decrease in platelet numbers and the prothrombotic events but not platelet aggregation in vitro.At 4 h after DEP exposure, the cardiovascular changes did not appear to result from pulmonary inflammation but possibly from the entry of DEP and/or their associated components into blood. However, at 18 h, DEP induced significant changes in pulmonary and cardiovascular functions along with lung inflammation. Pretreatment with thymoquinone prevented DEP-induced cardiovascular changes."
2016,26260694,PTHrP attenuates osteoblast cell death and apoptosis induced by a novel class of anti-cancer agents.,"The effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents often limits their use due to their negative effects on normal cells. Apoptosis regulatory protein (CARP)-1 functional mimetics (CFMs) belong to a novel class of compounds that possess anti-cancer properties with potential utility in breast and other cancers. In this study, we investigated the growth inhibitory action of CFM-4 and -5 in bone-forming osteoblasts and role of a skeletal regulator, parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide (PTHrP), which is frequently associated with oncologic pathologies. MC3T3E1-clone4 (MC-4) or primary osteoblasts were treated with CFMs. Western blots were performed to determine specific protein expressions. MTT, TUNEL assay, ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining, and ApoAlert caspase profiling were used to investigate cell viability and apoptosis of osteoblasts. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to observe intracellular localization of CARP-1. Our studies revealed that CFM-4 and -5 suppressed growths of mature differentiated, but not proliferating, MC-4 cells and PTHrP attenuated this effect. Mechanistically, induction of CARP-1 protein by CFM-4 and -5 was partially decreased by PTHrP. While CARP-1 increased by CFM-4 or -5 correlated with activated caspase-3, PTHrP remarkably blocked caspase-3 activation. PTHrP also influenced translocation of CFM-induced CARP-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our data identify a new function of PTHrP in maintaining osteoblast homeostasis in chemotherapy and define a role of CARP-1 in this process. The crosstalk of PTHrP and CFM-4 and -5 signaling highlights the importance of CFMs as potential anti-cancer therapeutics in breast and other cancers which adversely affect bone. "
2016,28004034,Klebsiella pneumoniae Planktonic and Biofilm Reduction by Different Plant Extracts: In Vitro Study.,"This study evaluated the action of Pfaffia paniculata K., Juglans regia L., and Rosmarius officinalis L. extracts against planktonic form and biofilm of Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 4352). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) values were determined for each extract by microdilution broth method, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Next, antimicrobial activity of the extracts on biofilm was analyzed. For this, standardized suspension at 107 UFC/mL of K. pneumoniae was distributed into 96-well microplates (n = 10) and after 48 h at 37°C and biofilm was subjected to treatment for 5 min with the extracts at a concentration of 200 mg/mL. ANOVA and Tukey tests (5%) were used to verify statistical significant reduction (p < 0.05) of planktonic form and biofilm. P paniculata K., R. officinalis L., and J. regia L. showed reductions in biomass of 55.6, 58.1, and 18.65% and cell viability reduction of 72.4, 65.1, and 31.5%, respectively. The reduction obtained with P. paniculata and R. officinalis extracts was similar to the reduction obtained with chlorhexidine digluconate 2%. In conclusion, all extracts have microbicidal action on the planktonic form but only P. paniculata K. and R. officinalis L. were effective against biofilm."
1999,10540743,"Inhibition of Candida rugosa lipase by berberine and structurally related alkaloids, evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography.","It is known that certain microorganisms produce extracellular lipase to better colonize the skin and mucosal surfaces. Since different extracts from medicinal plants have anti-lipase activity (Shimura et al., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 56: 1478-1479, 1992), we examined the effects of selected natural substances on Candida rugosa lipase. In the presence of the compounds under examination, the enzyme was incubated with beta-naphthyl laurate, and beta-naphthol, produced by the enzymatic reaction, was extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC, using a C-18 column. Thus, the inhibitory activity was calculated by a proper formula based on the variations of the area under the chromatographic peak of beta-naphthol. The method was validated by analyzing substances with known anti-lipase activity such as saturated fatty acids (C10-16) and tetracycline. Berberine and a number of structurally related alkaloids such as chelidonine, chelerythrine, and sanguinarine appeared active. This property of berberine and sanguinarine is of interest because they are used in pathological conditions in which microbial lipases could play a pathogenic role."
2017,28412654,"Nigella sativa, a traditional Tunisian herbal medicine, attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a rat model.","The present study investigated the effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) on bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in rats. The rat model of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) was established by intratracheal instillation of BLM, and the effect of 1ml/kg oral NSO treatment once daily observed. The effect of NSO was studied over a period of 50daysusing 1H RMN analysis on the urine and broncho alveolar lavage fluid (Balf) of the rats. Histopathological (inflammation and fibrosis) and immunohistochemical (TGF-β1 density) changes were evaluated. Results found that the BLM group showed a significant increase in inflammatory index (II), fibrosis score (FS) and TGF-β1 distribution in the lung inflammatory infiltrate, accompanied by a decreased urinary secretion of Krebs cycle intermediates, including acetate, pyruvate, carnitine, trimethylamine-N-oxide and succinate. However, at the same time point, NSO treated rats had a reduced II and FS, and had an increased urinary secretion of histidine, fumarate, allantoin and malate. In conclusion, NSO treatment attenuated the effects of BLM-induced PF, by supporting lung, liver and kidney activity in resisting PF. These findings provide an insight into the preventive and therapeutic potential of NSO in the treatment of PF."
1991,1934168,"New polyphenolic 5'-nucleotidase inhibitors isolated from the wine grape ""Koshu"" and their biological effects.","New 5'-nucleotidase inhibitors designated as NPF-88BU-IA, NPF-88BU-IB, NPF-88BU-IIA and NPF-88BU-IIB, respectively, were isolated from the seeds and skin of the wine grape ""Koshu"". They were purified by solvent extraction, dialysis, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their physico-chemical properties revealed these compounds to be polyphenolic substances. The average relative molecular masses of the four were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis to be 7850, 5950, 11900, and 11300, respectively. They strongly inhibited 5'-nucleotidase activities from snake venom and rat liver membrane, and displayed significant therapeutic activity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. They also showed inhibitory effects on the growth of Streptococcus mutans MT8148(c), a primary cariogenic bacterium. Furthermore, these 5'-nucleotidase inhibitors inhibited the glucan formation from sucrose. These results suggest that the 5'-nucleotidase inhibitors can prevent the cause of caries of tooth."
2011,20803174,The mechanism of Cordyceps sinensis and strontium in prevention of osteoporosis in rats.,"The effects of Cordyceps sinensis (Caterpillar fungus) and strontium ranelate on ovariectomized osteopenic rats was studied in this paper. After the rats were treated orally with C. sinensis, strontium, and C. sinensis rich in strontium ranelate (CSS) respectively, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), serum osteocalcin (OC), homocysteine, C-terminal crosslinked telopeptides of collagen type I (CTX), estradiol, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) level were examined. The beneficial effects of CSS on improvement of osteoporosis in rats were attributable mainly to decrease ALP activity, TRAP activity, CTX level, and IFN-γ level. At the same time, CSS also increase the OC and estradiol level in ovariectomized osteopenic rats. This study demonstrates the value of C. sinensis rich in strontium ranelate in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis in humans."
2016,27451169,Accuracy of a method based on atomic absorption spectrometry to determine inorganic arsenic in food: Outcome of the collaborative trial IMEP-41.,"A collaborative trial was conducted to determine the performance characteristics of an analytical method for the quantification of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in food. The method is based on (i) solubilisation of the protein matrix with concentrated hydrochloric acid to denature proteins and allow the release of all arsenic species into solution, and (ii) subsequent extraction of the inorganic arsenic present in the acid medium using chloroform followed by back-extraction to acidic medium. The final detection and quantification is done by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS). The seven test items used in this exercise were reference materials covering a broad range of matrices: mussels, cabbage, seaweed (hijiki), fish protein, rice, wheat, mushrooms, with concentrations ranging from 0.074 to 7.55mgkg(-1). The relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 4.1 to 10.3%, while the relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) ranged from 6.1 to 22.8%. "
2014,24669389,Recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in women: allowing patients to self-initiate antibiotic therapy.,"Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a lower urinary tract infection occurring in the absence of anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract or any other complicating factors.The organism responsible is often an enterobacterium, especially Escherichia coli. What is the role of antibiotic therapy for non-pregnant women with recurrent acute uncomplicated cystitis? We reviewed the available evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. A single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol is the antibiotic of choice for treating an episode of acute uncomplicated cystitis. Alternative antibiotics are certain fluoroquinolones or co-trimoxazole (a fixed-dose combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim). For recurrent acute uncomplicated cystitis, cranberry juice has modest efficacy in reducing the frequency of episodes. A number of non-drug measures are typically proposed, although their effects are unproven: drinking sufficient fluids and urinating regularly; urinating after sexual intercourse; and avoiding spermicides. The strategy that results in the lowest antibiotic exposure is a short course of antibiotics for each episode of urinary tract infection, initiated as soon as clinical symptoms appear. Long-term antibiotic therapy is sometimes offered. According to one systematic review, women taking long-term prophylactic antibiotic therapy had about 6 times fewer clinical recurrences than with placebo. According to one randomised trial, 3 g of fosfomycin trometamol taken as a single dose every ten days reduced the frequency of recurrence, resulting in 0.14 episodes of infection per year on average versus about 3 episodes with placebo (p < 0.001). The amount of antibiotic used when fosfomycin trometamol is taken every 10 days for 6 months is equivalent to treatment of 18 acute episodes of cystitis. When cystitis appears to be associated with sexual intercourse, two small randomised trials suggest that routine postcoital antibiotic treatment is more effective than placebo and as effective as long-term antibiotic therapy. Adverse effects, some of which can be serious, depend on the antibiotic used. The development of resistance among enterobacteria is one argument for limiting the use of antibiotics, in order to preserve their efficacy in serious infections. In practice, the strategy that uses the fewest antibiotics is to treat each episode as soon as the first clinical symptoms appear. Cases in which the frequency of recurrence warrants regular antibiotic prophylaxis are rare. The optimal antibiotic regimen in these cases has not been determined, either in clinical trials or by consensus."
2016,27846826,Natural product HTP screening for antibacterial (E.coli 0157:H7) and anti-inflammatory agents in (LPS from E. coli O111:B4) activated macrophages and microglial cells; focus on sepsis.,"Acute systemic inflammatory response syndrome arising from infection can lead to multiple organ failure and death, with greater susceptibility occurring in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, sub-acute chronic inflammation is a contributor to the pathology of diverse degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis). Given the known limitations in Western medicine to treat a broad range of inflammatory related illness as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistance, there is a renewed interest in complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to achieve these means.A high throughput (HTP) screening of >1400 commonly sold natural products (bulk herbs, cooking spices, teas, leaves, supplement components, nutraceutical food components, fruit and vegetables, rinds, seeds, polyphenolics etc.) was conducted to elucidate anti-inflammatory substances in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli serotype O111:B4) monocytes: RAW 264.7 macrophages [peripheral], BV-2 microglia [brain]) relative to hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and L-N6-(1Iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL). HTP evaluation was also carried out for lethal kill curves against E.coli 0157:H7 1x106 CFU/mL relative to penicillin. Validation studies were performed to assess cytokine profiling using antibody arrays. Findings were corroborated by independent ELISAs and NO2-/iNOS expression quantified using the Griess Reagent and immunocytochemistry, respectively. For robust screening, we developed an in-vitro efficacy paradigm to ensure anti-inflammatory parameters were observed independent of cytotoxicity. This caution was taken given that many plants exert tumoricidal and anti-inflammatory effects at close range through similar signaling pathways, which could lead to false positives.The data show that activated BV-2 microglia cells (+ LPS 1μg/ml) release >10-fold greater IL-6, MIP1/2, RANTES and nitric oxide (NO2-), where RAW 264.7 macrophages (+ LPS 1μg/ml) produced > 10-fold rise in sTNFR2, MCP-1, IL-6, GCSF, RANTES and NO2-. Data validation studies establish hydrocortisone and dexamethasone as suppressing multiple pro-inflammatory processes, where L-NIL suppressed NO2-, but had no effect on iNOS expression or IL-6. The screening results demonstrate relative few valid hits with anti-inflammatory effects at < 250μg/ml for the following: Bay Leaf (Laurus nobilis), Elecampagne Root (Inula helenium), Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare),Yerba (Eriodictyon californicum) and Centipeda (Centipeda minima), Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Turmeric Root (Curcuma Longa), Osha Root (Ligusticum porteri), Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) and constituents: cardamonin, apigenin, quercetin, biochanin A, eupatorin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and butein. Natural products lethal against [E. coli 0157:H7] where the LC50 < 100 μg/ml included bioactive silver hydrosol-Argentyn 23, green tea (its constituents EGCG > Polyphenon 60 > (-)-Gallocatechin > Epicatechin > (+)-Catechin), Grapeseed Extract (Vitis vinifera), Chinese Gallnut (its constituents gallic acid > caffeic acid) and gallic acid containing plants such as Babul Chall Bark (Acacia Arabica), Arjun (Terminalia Arjuna) and Bayberry Root Bark (Morella Cerifera).These findings emphasize and validate the previous work of others and identify the most effective CAM anti-inflammatory, antibacterial compounds using these models. Future work will be required to evaluate potential combination strategies for long-term use to prevent chronic inflammation and possibly lower the risk of sepsis in immunocompromised at risk populations."
2011,21393119,The effectiveness of fortified flour on micro-nutrient status in rural female adults in China.,"This research was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of fortified flour on micronutrient status in poor rural adult women. A total of 4,700 farmers as the intervention group were supplied with multi-nutrient fortified wheat flour for three years, while 2750 farmers as the control group were supplied with unfortified wheat flour. Wheat flour was fortified with vitamins A, B-1, B-2, niacin, folic acid, iron and zinc in mg/kg at 2, 3.5, 3.5, 35, 1, 20 and 25, respectively. Blood samples were taken at baseline and annually from about 300 volunteer adult females aged 20-60 years in each group. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum retinol, serum iron, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum zinc were measured annually and a dietary survey conducted every 6 months. Average intakes of fortified micronutrients increased to adequate levels with average consumption of fortified flour at 117 g per person per day. Intervention groups showed a significant increase in terms of Hb levels from 24 m to 36 m and anemia rate decreased from 15.1% at baseline to 10.8% at 36 m. Serum iron levels of the intervention group significantly increased from 12 m to 36 m and erythrocyte protoporphyrin decreased from 24 m to 36 m respectively. Serum retinol and serum zinc of intervention group improved significantly from 12 m to 36 m compared with baseline and control group. The results showed that the fortified flour could improve micronutrient status of adult females in poor rural region."
2017,28972884,In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity of dichloromethane fraction of Triticum aestivum sprouts.,"Triticum aestivum sprouts (TA) contain significant amounts of chlorophyll, minerals, enzymes, and other functional entities. Furthermore, TA extracts have been shown to possess anti-obesity, anti-diabetic and hepatoprotective effects and are believed to help blood flow, digestion, and general detoxification of the body. In this study, the mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of a dichloromethane fraction of TA (TDF) was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro study was done by examining cancer cells growth, morphological changes, cell cycles, expressions of death receptors and apoptosis-linked proteins in wide range of human cancer cell lines. To investigate the effect of TDF in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were injected with B16 melanoma cells and orally administered TDF. TDF markedly inhibited cancer cell growth and induced cellular morphological alterations, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and enhanced the expressions of death receptors (DR)-4, 5, and 6 in cell lines. In addition, TDF regulated the expressions mitochondrial apoptosis-linked proteins and induced caspase-dependent cell death. It also significantly enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK, but not p38, whereas inhibited the activation of NF-κB in cancer cells. In our mouse model, TDF significantly suppressed B16 melanoma growth, to an extent similar to cisplatin (reference control) and augmented immunomodulatory cytokines. In brief, this study presents the mechanism responsible for the anti-cancer effects of TDF in vitro and in vivo."
2004,15794090,[Analysis of pesticides including chlorine in welsh onions and mushrooms using gas chromatograph with an atomic emission detector (GC-AED)].,"An analytical method for the determination of 32 kinds of pesticide residues in onions, Welsh onions and mushrooms using gas chromatograph with an atomic emission detector (GC-AED) was developed. The pesticides were extracted with acetone-n-hexane (2:3) mixture. The crude extract was partitioned between 5% sodium chloride and ethyl acetate-n-hexane (1:4) mixture. The extract was passed through a Florisil mini-column for cleanup with 10 mL of acetone-n-hexane (1:9) mixture. Although the sensitivity of GC-AED was inferior to that of GC-ECD, GC-AED has a superior element-selectivity. Therefore pesticide residues in foods could be analyzed more exactly by using GC-AED. Thirty-two pesticides including chlorine in onion, Welsh onion and shiitake mushroom were detected without interference. Recoveries of these pesticides from samples determined by GC-AED were 64-114%, except for a few pesticides."
2014,24389490,Nobiletin suppresses MMP-9 expression through modulation of p38 MAPK activity in human dermal fibrobalsts.,"We aimed to identify a novel flavonoid from the in-house natural products to suppress matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which is responsible for degradation of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. Total eight natural products were screened for identification of a novel MMP-9 suppressor using MMP-9 reporter system, where the prompt initial screening with multiple samples is readily examined. Among the extracts used in the present study, one extract (Citrus unshiu) was found active in this assay system. Furthermore, three representative flavonoids in this active extract of Citrus unshiu peel were tested in MMP-9 reporter system. Nobiletin (NB) of the tested flavonoids suppressed MMP-9 expression without cytotoxicity, which was validated by both real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and zymography analyses. Sustained p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, closely associated with induction of MMP-9 under stress condition, was markedly reduced by NB treatment, which implies that modulation of p38MAPK by nobiletin is responsible for reduction of MMP9 expression. Hence, nobiletin, identified from MMP-9 reporter system based screening, may be further applied for the purpose of delaying collagen degradation in skin fibroblasts. "
1990,2389262,Cisplatin: effects on the stretch receptor neuron of the crayfish.,"The effects of cisplatin on electrical and mechanotransducer properties of the crayfish stretch receptor neuron was studied using a microelectrode voltage clamp technique. In the stretch receptor neuron, negligible changes in membrane capacitance, leak conductance, resting membrane potential, potential-dependent currents or mechanoreceptor current were seen either on acute cisplatin treatment or after long-lasting treatment for up to 2 weeks. The inhibitory GABA-sensitive synapse on the neuron was not affected by cisplatin. The cisplatin cytotoxicity on sensory neurons such as outer hair cells of the organ of Corti cannot be explained by direct effects on ionic channels of these cells including stretch-activated channels."
2021,31072167,The effects of methanolic extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra on the prevention and treatment of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rat: experimental study.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by dyspnea and progressive loss of lung function. In this study, the preventive and therapeutic effects of methanolic extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra on pulmonary fibrosis were investigated. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by administration of bleomycin (BLM) into the left lung of rats. Methyl-prednisolone (M-pred, 4 mg/kg) and methanolic extract of G. glabra (500 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally from the 1st to 14th days in the preventive group and from the 14th to 28th days in the therapeutic group once every day. Pulmonary inflammatory and fibrotic indices were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome, respectively. The level of hydroxyproline as an index of pulmonary fibrosis and malondialdehyde (MDA) as an oxidative stress biomarker and catalase were measured by the related ELISA Kits. Pulmonary inflammatory and fibrotic indices in the G. glabra and M-pred groups significantly reduced compared with BLM group. G. glabra decreased the level of hydroxyproline in pulmonary tissue similar to M-pred. MDA reduced in G. glabra and M-pred groups compared with BLM group. The activity of catalase increased in the G. glabra preventive group. According to the results, G. glabra prevented and treated pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation in rats. Therefore, G. glabra may be suggested for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation."
2013,22935222,The citrus flavanone naringenin suppresses CYP1B1 transactivation through antagonising xenobiotic-responsive element binding.,"Exposure to environmental toxicants or exogenous oestrogen increases the risk of cancer. Some toxicants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) undergo biotransformation to become genotoxic agents. Cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1B1 is an enzyme catalysing this transformation. Consumption of fruit and vegetables is considered to be protective against carcinogenesis, and naringenin can be found abundantly in citrus fruits. In the present study, the effect of naringenin on the regulation of CYP1B1 was investigated in MCF-7 cells. Enzyme inhibition assays revealed that naringenin inhibited CYP1B1 at or above 5 μm but not CYP1A1 activity. Quantitative PCR analysis also demonstrated that 1 μm-naringenin reduced CYP1B1 mRNA expression induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (DMBA). Further study illustrated that the suppression was at the transcriptional level. Since previous studies have shown that oestrogen response element (ERE) and xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) are functional binding sequences in the promoter region of CYP1B1, interference of DNA binding on these two elements was pursued. Employing reporter gene assays as well as the electromobility shift assay, we verified that naringenin counteracted DMBA-induced XRE binding at − 1675. These results supported the notion that fruit consumption could be a protective measure against PAH biotransformation."
2017,28073348,Wild carrot pentane-based fractions suppress proliferation of human HaCaT keratinocytes and protect against chemically-induced skin cancer.,"Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the Lebanese Daucus carota ssp. carota (wild carrot) oil extract possesses in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities. The present study aims to examine the cytotoxic effect of Daucus carota oil fractions on human epidermal keratinocytes and evaluate the chemopreventive activity of the pentane diethyl ether fraction on DMBA/TPA induced skin carcinogenesis in mice.Wild carrot oil extract was chromatographed to yield four fractions (F1, 100% pentane; F2, 50:50 pentane:diethyl ether; F3, 100% diethyl ether; F4 93:7 chloroform:methanol). The cytotoxic effect of fractions (10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) was tested on human epidermal keratinocytes (non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells and tumorigenic HaCaT-ras variants) using WST a ssay. Cell cycle phase distribution of tumorigenic HaCaT-ras variants was determined by flow cytometry post-treatment with F2 fraction. Apoptosis related proteins were also assessed using western blot. The antitumor activity of F2 fraction was also evaluated using a DMBA/TPA induced skin carcinoma in Balb/c mice.All fractions exhibited significant cytotoxicity, with HaCaT cells being 2.4-3 times less sensitive than HaCaT-ras A5 (benign tumorigenic), and HaCaT-ras II4 (malignant) cells. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of a major compound (around 60%) in the pentane/diethylether fraction (F2), identified as 2-himachalen-6-ol. Treatment of HaCaT-ras A5 and HaCaT-ras II4 cells with F2 fraction resulted in the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 apoptotic phase and decreased the population of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Additionally, F2 fraction treatment caused an up-regulation of the expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and down-regulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) proteins. A decrease in the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was also observed. Intraperitoneal treatment with F2 fraction (50 or 200 mg/kg) in the DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis mouse model showed a significant inhibition of papilloma incidence (mice with papilloma), yield (number of papilloma/mouse) and volume (tumor relative size) at weeks 15, 18 and 21.The present data reveal that F2 fraction has a remarkable antitumor activity against DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis, an effect that may be mediated through inhibition of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways."
,17254746,"Activity, toxicity and analysis of resistance of essential oil from Chenopodium ambrosioides after intraperitoneal, oral and intralesional administration in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania amazonensis: a preliminary study.","The World Health Organization has classified the leishmaniasis as a major tropical disease. Current therapy is toxic, expensive and cause several adverse effects. The majority of people in endemic areas of leishmaniasis depend of natural and traditional medicine. This study was developed to examine the activity of the essential oil from Chenopodium ambrosioides in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania amazonensis. The infected animals received two cycle of treatment by different routes (intraperitoneal, oral or intralesional route). The intraperitoneal administration of the essential oil at dose of 30 mg/Kg prevented lesion development and decrease the parasite burden. Oral administration retarded the infection in the experimental model compared with untreated mice, although it was less effective that the intraperitoneal route. The administration by intralesional route did not show activity. Intraperitoneal and oral treatment at 30 mg/Kg with the essential oil had better antileishmanial effect that treatment with the reference drug, amphotericin B at 1 mg/Kg. Preliminarily, we examined the toxicity and the resistance after treatment. Signs of toxicity were evident only in the animals treated by intraperitoneal route. No resistance was detected in L. amazonensis isolates obtained from treated mice. These data clearly demonstrated that this natural product could be an alternative for the development of a new drug against cutaneous leishmaniasis based in the ethnomedical information."
2004,15036657,"20(S)-Protopanaxatriol, one of ginsenoside metabolites, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions through inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.","Ginsenosides from Panax ginseng are metabolized by human intestinal bacteria after oral administration of ginseng extract. 20(S)-Protopanaxatriol (PPT) is one of the major metabolites of ginsenosides. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are important enzymes that mediate inflammatory processes. Improper up-regulation of iNOS and/or COX-2 has been associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and certain types of human cancers. Here, we investigated whether PPT could modulate iNOS and COX-2 expressions in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that PPT blocked the increase in LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 expressions through inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB by preventing I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation. Thus, it may be possible to develop PPT as a useful agent for chemoprevention of cancer or inflammatory diseases."
2006,16303845,Increased adrenal androgen secretion with inhibition of 11beta-hydroxylase in HIV-infected women.,"Adrenal androgen production is reduced in association with disease severity in HIV-infected women. This response may be maladaptive in terms of maintenance of lean body mass, functional status, and immune function. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of an adrenal enzyme inhibitor of 11beta-hydroxylase might increase androgen production in this population. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metyrapone (500 mg p.o. qid) or placebo for 2 wk in 10 HIV-infected women with AIDS wasting [weight <90% ideal body weight (IBW) or weight loss >10%] and reduced androgen levels. Basal and ACTH-stimulated androgen, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid levels were measured at baseline and after 14 days of treatment. Subjects were similar in age (40.9 +/- 0.9 yr), weight (91.7 +/- 3.5% IBW) and hormone concentrations at study entry. Total testosterone (84 +/- 54 vs. -0.4 +/- 2 ng/dl, P = 0.024), free testosterone (6.5 +/- 2.8 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 pg/ml, P = 0.024), DHEA (5.0 +/- 3.2 vs. -0.6 +/- 0.5 microg/l, P = 0.024), and 11-deoxycortisol (2,145 +/- 820 vs. -14 +/- 22 ng/dl, P = 0.024) levels increased in response to metyrapone compared with placebo treatment. In response to ACTH, significant increases in the DHEA/cortisol ratio (174 +/- 48 vs. 3 +/- 3, P = 0.008) were seen in the metyrapone group compared with placebo. Blood pressure and electrolytes did not change, and signs of adrenal insufficiency were not apparent. These data demonstrate that inhibition of 11beta-hydroxylase with metyrapone increases adrenal androgen secretion in HIV-infected women. Further studies are needed to assess the physiological effects of this strategy to increase anabolic hormone levels in severe stress, including detailed testing to rule out the potential risk of concomitant adrenal insufficiency."
2014,24587721,The modification of polyurethane foams using new boroorganic polyols (II) polyurethane foams from boron-modified hydroxypropyl urea derivatives.,"The work focuses on research related to determination of application possibility of new, ecofriendly boroorganic polyols in rigid polyurethane foams production. Polyols were obtained from hydroxypropyl urea derivatives esterified with boric acid and propylene carbonate. The influence of esterification type on properties of polyols and next on polyurethane foams properties was determined. Nitrogen and boron impacts on the foams' properties were discussed, for instance, on their physical, mechanical, and electric properties. Boron presence causes improvement of dimensional stability and thermal stability of polyurethane foams. They can be applied even at temperature 150 °C. Unfortunately, introducing boron in polyurethanes foams affects deterioration of their water absorption, which increases as compared to the foams that do not contain boron. However, presence of both boron and nitrogen determines the decrease of the foams combustibility. Main impact on the decrease combustibility of the obtained foams has nitrogen presence, but in case of proper boron and nitrogen ratio their synergic activity on the combustibility decrease can be easily seen."
2018,29715759,Cardioprotective effect of Amaranthus tricolor extract in isoprenaline induced myocardial damage in ovariectomized rats.,"Red spinach (Amaranthus tricolor) has been reported to possess many benefits and medicinal properties and used as a part of traditional medicine in Ayurveda and Siddha. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of Amaranthus tricolor on isoproterenol-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomy surgery was conducted to remove both ovaries from the rats. After recovery, rats were administered with ISO subcutaneously (50 mg/kg) twice a week and were treated with ethanolic extracts of A. tricolor. This investigation showed that the level of oxidative stress markers was significantly increased while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. A. tricolor extract and atenolol treatment prevented the rise of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and advanced protein oxidation product. Moreover, elevated activities of AST, ALT, and CK-MB enzymes were also lowered by both atenolol and A. tricolor treatment. Increased uric acid and creatinine levels were also normalized by atenolol, and A. Tricolor treatment in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. ISO-induced ovariectomized rats also showed massive inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis and iron deposition in heart compared to sham rats. Atenolol and A. tricolor treatment prevented the inflammatory cells infiltration, fibrosis, and iron deposition. These results suggest that A. tricolor treatment may protect against ISO administered myocardial infarction in ovariectomized rats probably by preventing inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Further research is warranted to examine molecular mechanism of cardioprotective effect of A. tricolor."
2018,29677543,"Garcinia morella fruit, a promising source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents induces breast cancer cell death via triggering apoptotic pathway.","A rapid rise in cancer cases worldwide, especially breast cancer in females, instigates the need for more effective and less side effect causing drugs from natural origin. Thereby, in the present study, Garcinia morella fruit was investigated for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-breast cancer activity. Preliminary antioxidant and anticancer evaluation of different fractions and crude methanol extract of G. morella fruit suggested chloroform fraction as the bioactive fraction. Time course analysis (by 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) of the bioactive fraction (1.56-25) μg/ml treatment on breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDAMB231 and SKBR3) showed dose and time dependent antiproliferative responses. Further, mechanistic studies involving morphological observation and western blotting analysis, revealed its apoptosis inducing effect on breast cancer. P53 dependent up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl XL is suggested as the possible pathway of apoptosis followed by MCF7 cells on exposure to the bioactive fraction. The anti-inflammatory assays revealed that it significantly lowered the release of nitrite and TNF-α level of LPS induced RAW 264.7 cells (p < 0.05). Moreover, pre treatment of Carrageenan induced paw edema animals with 20 mg/kg of the bioactive fraction significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited paw inflammation and controlled the cytokine and nitrite levels of the edema induced rat. Its main bioactive component was identified to be Garcinol by UHPLC and ESI-MS/MS. Thereby, this study clearly reflects that G. morella fruit is a valuable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory gift of nature with the potential to be used against breast cancer. This is also the first report of isolation of bioactive compound Garcinol from G. morella fruit."
2010,20370946,A human volunteer study to assess the impact of confectionery sweeteners on the gut microbiota composition.,"Sweeteners are being sourced to lower the energetic value of confectionery including chocolates. Some, especially non-digestible carbohydrates, may possess other benefits for human health upon their fermentation by the colonic microbiota. The present study assessed non-digestible carbohydrate sweeteners, selected for use in low-energy chocolates, for their ability to beneficially modulate faecal bacterial profiles in human volunteers. Forty volunteers consumed a test chocolate (low-energy or experimental chocolate) containing 22.8 g of maltitol (MTL), MTL and polydextrose (PDX), or MTL and resistant starch for fourteen consecutive days. The dose of the test chocolates was doubled every 2 weeks over a 6-week period. Numbers of faecal bifidobacteria significantly increased with all the three test treatments. Chocolate containing the PDX blend also significantly increased faecal lactobacilli (P = 0.00 001) after the 6 weeks. The PDX blend also showed significant increases in faecal propionate and butyrate (P = 0.002 and 0.006, respectively). All the test chocolates were well tolerated with no significant change in bowel habit or intestinal symptoms even at a daily dose of 45.6 g of non-digestible carbohydrate sweetener. This is of importance not only for giving manufacturers a sugar replacement that can reduce energetic content, but also for providing a well-tolerated means of delivering high levels of non-digestible carbohydrates into the colon, bringing about improvements in the biomarkers of gut health."
2008,17916277,Walnut extract (Juglans regia L.) and its component ellagic acid exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in human aorta endothelial cells and osteoblastic activity in the cell line KS483.,"Epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of CVD and postmenopausal osteoporosis is low in the Mediterranean area, where herbs and nuts, among others, play an important role in nutrition. In the present study, we sought a role of walnuts (Juglans regia L.) in endothelial and bone-cell function. As the endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules has been recognised as an early step in inflammation and atherogenesis, we examined the effect of walnut methanolic extract and ellagic acid, one of its major polyphenolic components (as shown by HPLC analysis), on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in human aortic endothelial cells. After incubating the cells with TNF-alpha (1 ng/ml) in the absence and in the presence of walnut extract (10-200 microg/ml) or ellagic acid (10- 7-10- 5 m), the VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression was quantified by cell-ELISA. We further evaluated the effect of walnut extract (10-50 microg/ml), in comparison with ellagic acid (10- 9-10- 6m), on nodule formation in the osteoblastic cell line KS483. Walnut extract and ellagic acid decreased significantly the TNF-alpha-induced endothelial expression of both VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001). Both walnut extract (at 10-25 microg/ml) and ellagic acid (at 10- 9-10- 8 m) induced nodule formation in KS483 osteoblasts. The present results suggest that the walnut extract has a high anti-atherogenic potential and a remarkable osteoblastic activity, an effect mediated, at least in part, by its major component ellagic acid. Such findings implicate the beneficial effect of a walnut-enriched diet on cardioprotection and bone loss."
2006,17005160,"Elevated K-ras activity with cholestyramine and lovastatin, but not konjac mannan or niacin in lung--importance of mouse strain.","Our previous work established that hypocholesterolemic agents altered K-ras intracellular localization in lung. Here, we examined K-ras activity to define further its potential importance in lung carcinogenesis. K-ras activity in lungs from male A/J, Swiss and C57BL/6 mice was examined. For 3 weeks, mice consumed either 2 or 4% cholestyramine (CS), 1% niacin, 5% konjac mannan (KM), or were injected with lovastatin 25mg/kg three or five times weekly (Lov-3X and Lov-5X). A pair-fed (PF) group was fed the same quantity of diet consumed by the Lov-5X mice to control for lower body weights in Lov-5X mice. After 3 weeks, serum cholesterol was assayed with a commercial kit. Activated K-ras protein from lung was affinity precipitated with a Raf-1 ras binding domain-glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads, followed by Western blotting, K-ras antibody treatment, and chemiluminescent detection. Only KM reduced serum cholesterol (in two of three mouse strains). In C56BL/6 mice treated with Lov-3X, lung K-ras activity increased 1.8-fold versus control (p=0.009). In normal lung with wild-type K-ras, this would be expected to be associated with maintenance of differentiation. In A/J mice fed 4% CS, K-ras activity increased 2.1-fold (p=0.02), which might be responsible for the reported enhancement of carcinogenesis in carcinogen-treated rats fed CS. KM feeding and PF treatment had no significant effects on K-ras activity. These data are consistent with the concept that K-ras in lung has an oncogenic function when mutated, but may act as a tumor suppressor when wild-type."
2014,24295730,Ontogenetic manganese exposure with perinatal 6-OHDA lesioning alters behavioral responses of rats to dopamine D₁ and D2 agonist treatments.,"The effect of neonatal manganese (Mn) exposure in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease was investigated. Pregnant Wistar rats were given drinking water with 10,000 ppm of Manganese (MnCl₂.4H₂O) from the time of conception until weaning on the 21st day after delivery. Control rats consumed tap water. Three days after the birth, other groups of neonatal rat pups were pretreated with desipramine (20 mg/kg ip 1h) prior to bilateral ICV administration of 6-OHDA or its vehicle, saline-ascorbic (0.1%) (control). Two months after the birth, striatal dopamine and homovanilic acid efflux measured by an in vivo microdialysis method were reduced in rats lesioned with 6-OHDA. Co-exposure to perinatal Mn did not modify neurotransmission alterations. However, there were prominent abnormalities in behavioral testing in rats perinatally exposed to Mn and treated neonatally with 6-OHDA. These findings demonstrate that although Mn did not further damage neurotransmitter activity in the neostriatum, ontogenetic exposure to Mn enhances the behavioral toxicity to 6-OHDA."
2001,11226385,Inhibition by ginkgolides and bilobalide of the production of nitric oxide in macrophages (THP-1) but not in endothelial cells (HUVEC).,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a principal mediator in many physiological and pathological processes. NO produced by constitutive nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells (eNOS) acts as a vasodilator, whereas excess NO production due to elevated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) may produce cytotoxic effects to cells in the vascular wall. We demonstrated in our previous work that the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb) inhibits iNOS-mediated NO production. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of several active EGb components on iNOS-mediated NO production in macrophages derived from a human monocytic cell line (THP-1), as well as on eNOS-mediated NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, or bilobalide (0.25 to 1.0 microg/mL) caused a 30-65% reduction in the levels of NO metabolites released by THP-1 macrophages after 4 hr of incubation, with a corresponding decrease in iNOS activity. Western immunoblotting analysis coupled with a nuclease protection assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed a concomitant reduction in the levels of iNOS protein mass and mRNA in ginkgolide A-, ginkgolide B-, or bilobalide-treated macrophages. On the other hand, these compounds did not affect eNOS-mediated NO production or the expression of eNOS protein and mRNA in HUVEC. Taken together, these results suggest that ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, and bilobalide may contribute to the selective inhibitory effect of EGb on iNOS expression without affecting eNOS-mediated NO production."
,10773613,Calcitriol therapy modulates the cellular immune responses in hemodialysis patients.,"We studied the in vitro and in vivo effects of calcitriol (1,25D) on the cellular immune responses in 19 hemodialysis (HD) patients. In vitro 5-day treatment with 1,25D markedly reduced the HLA-DR expression by peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes from both HD patients and normal subjects in a similar fashion. The HLA-DR expression by monocytes and the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced superoxide production (SOP) by neutrophils were significantly higher in the HD patients than in the normal subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The phagocytic activity in the HD patients was significantly lower than that in the normal subjects (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mitogen response of HD peripheral blood lymphocytes against pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was significantly lower than that of the controls (p < 0.01) but was only slightly and insignificantly lower against Con A. Oral 1,25D pulse therapy resulted in a marked decrease in the HLA-DR expression by peripheral blood monocytes 2 and 4 days after the first 1,25D administration (p < 0.01) in HD patients. Moreover, the treatment significantly enhanced the PMA-induced SOP 2 days after the treatment (p < 0.01). However, the phagocytic activity by neutrophils and the mitogen responses to Con A and PWM by lymphocytes were not significantly affected by this treatment. These results suggest that 1,25D plays a significant role in the regulation of both the monocyte and neutrophil functions in HD patients."
2017,27799220,Covalent Immobilization of Enoxacin onto Titanium Implant Surfaces for Inhibiting Multiple Bacterial Species Infection and In Vivo Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection Prophylaxis.,"Infection is one of the most important causes of titanium implant failure in vivo A developing prophylactic method involves the immobilization of antibiotics, especially vancomycin, onto the surface of the titanium implant. However, these methods have a limited effect in curbing multiple bacterial infections due to antibiotic specificity. In the current study, enoxacin was covalently bound to an amine-functionalized Ti surface by use of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, and the bactericidal effectiveness was investigated in vitro and in vivo The titanium surface was amine functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), through which PEG spacer molecules were covalently immobilized onto the titanium, and then the enoxacin was covalently bound to the PEG, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). A spread plate assay, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the antimicrobial activity. For the in vivo study, Ti implants were inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and implanted into the femoral medullary cavity of rats. The degree of infection was assessed by radiography, micro-computed tomography, and determination of the counts of adherent bacteria 3 weeks after surgery. Our data demonstrate that the enoxacin-modified PEGylated Ti surface effectively prevented bacterial colonization without compromising cell viability, adhesion, or proliferation in vitro Furthermore, it prevented MRSA infection of the Ti implants in vivo Taken together, our results demonstrate that the use of enoxacin-modified Ti is a potential approach to the alleviation of infections of Ti implants by multiple bacterial species."
2008,26047279,Impact of parboiling conditions on Maillard precursors and indicators in long-grain rice cultivars.,"The effect of steaming conditions (mild, intermediate and severe) during parboiling of five different long-grain rice cultivars (brown rice cultivars Puntal, Cocodrie, XL8 and Jacinto, and a red rice) on rice colour, and Maillard precursors and indicators was investigated. Rice colour increased with severity of parboiling conditions. Redness increased more than yellowness when parboiling brown rice. Parboiling turned red rice black. It changed the levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Losses of the non-reducing sugar, sucrose were caused by both leaching into the soaking water and enzymic conversion, rather than by thermal degradation during steaming. Concentrations of the reducing sugars, glucose and fructose, in intermediately parboiled rice were higher than those of mildly parboiled rice. After severe parboiling, glucose levels were lower than those of intermediately parboiled rice, while fructose levels were higher. These changes were ascribed to the sum of losses in the Maillard reaction (MR), formations as a result of starch degradation and isomerisation of glucose into fructose. It was clear that the ε-amino group of protein-bound lysine was more affected by parboiling conditions and loss in MRs, than that of free lysine. Low values of the MR indicators furosine and free 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) in processed brown and red rices were related to mild parboiling, whereas high furosine and low free HMF levels were indicative of rices being subjected to intermediate processing conditions. High furosine and high free HMF contents corresponded to severe hydrothermal treatments. The strong correlation (r=0.89) between the free HMF levels and the increase in redness of parboiled brown rices suggested that Maillard browning was reflected more in the red than in the yellow colour.

2018,28577233,Zinc and Selenium Co-supplementation Reduces Some Lipid Peroxidation and Angiogenesis Markers in a Rat Model of NAFLD-Fed High Fat Diet.,"Studies have shown that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients are more prone to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Zinc and selenium deficiency are common in NAFLD. But the effects of zinc and selenium co-supplementation before and/or after disease progression on CVD markers are not clear in NAFLD patients. This study aimed to compare the effects of zinc and selenium co-supplementation before and/or after disease progression on some of the CVD markers in an experimental model of NAFLD. Forty male Sprague Dawley rats (197 ± 4 g) were randomly assigned into four dietary groups: control group (C; received 9% of calorie as fat), model group (M; received 82% of calorie as fat), and supplementation before (BS) or after (AS) disease progression. Animals were fed diets for 20 weeks in all groups. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, HOMA-IR, ALT, AST, lipid profile, malondialdehyde (MDA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured as CVD indices. Serum ALT, AST, FPG, insulin, MDA, VEGF and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the M than C group. Co-supplementation reduced serum ALT and AST levels in the BS and AS groups compared with the M group. FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR, VEGF, MDA, LDL/HDL-c and TC/HDL-c ratio were significantly reduced in the AS compared with the M group. TG/HDL-c ratio was significantly reduced in the BS and AS compared with the M group. Serum MDA, VEGF, Insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly lowered in the AS than BS group (p < 0.05). Zinc and selenium co-supplementation after NAFLD progression reduced CVD risk indices in an experimental model."
2010,20731192,An evaluation of beta-hydroxybutyrate in milk and blood for prediction of subclinical ketosis in dairy cows.,"The first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) in milk and blood to assess the reliability of the BHBA concentrations in milk measured by a semi quantitative keto-test paper to detect subclinical ketosis (SCK) in 50 fresh high-producing Iranian Holstein cows in Golestan Province, Iran. The second objective was the effects of SCK on milk yield and components. Concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and BHBA were analyzed quantitatively in blood plasma and commercial keto-test paper was used for semi quantitative determination of BHBA concentration in milk. Milk yield was measured until 60 d after calving but milk compositions were measured until 30 d after calving. The mean plasma BHBA, milk BHBA, plasma NEFA, milk yield, milk fat percentage and milk fat: protein ratio were 1,234 micromol/L, 145 micromol/L, 0.482 mEq/L, 29.5 kg, 3.9% and 1.4, respectively. Fifty eight percent of the cows had SCK during the first month of lactation. High correlation coefficients were observed between blood BHBA and blood NEFA, and between blood and milk BHBA. The milk yield of cattle with SCK decreased (P < 0.01) but the fat percentage and milk fat: protein ratio increased (P < 0.01). The commercial keto-test paper used had a low false positive result at a cut-off point of 200 fmol of BHBA/L of milk. The results showed that the best time to assess SCK using the commercial keto-test paper was d 10, 14 and 17 after calving."
1999,10545668,Clearance and metabolism of starch foods in the oral cavity.,"The presence of carbohydrates and organic acids was monitored in the oral cavity over a 3-hour period following the ingestion of six foods containing cooked starch (popcorn, potato chips, corn flakes, bread stick, hard pretzel and wheat cracker) and compared to a food containing sugar (chocolate-covered candy bar). Oral fluid samples were collected at 30-min intervals from five different tooth sites from 7 volunteers using absorbent paper points. Samples were analyzed for carbohydrates and organic acids using high-performance liquid chromatography. Analytical data for each food were pooled and compared to the results of the sugar food. The amount of lactic acid produced 30 min after ingestion was highest with the potato chips and lowest with the corn flakes. Potato starch contributed more readily to oral lactic acid production than wheat or corn starch. A direct linear relationship existed between lactic acid production and the presence of oral glucose produced from starch, which occurred via the metabolites maltotriose and maltose. Oral clearance of foods containing cooked starch proceeded significantly slower than that of the sugar food, thus contributing to a prolonged period of lactic acid production."
1988,2460001,Reproducible cloning assays for in vitro growth of canine hematopoietic progenitor cells and their potential applications in investigative hematotoxicity.,"A variety of in vitro cloning assays have been used for studying hematopoiesis in mice and human beings. However, these techniques have had limited use in dogs, a species used extensively as a model for hematopoietic research, particularly hematotoxicity. We have adopted cloning assays for in vitro growth of canine colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells, using modified microplasma clot and soft agar culture systems, respectively. Marrow mononuclear cells separated by density-gradient centrifugation were added to the aforementioned culture systems. Erythroid colonies were stimulated with sheep plasma erythropoietin and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. The CFU-E colonies were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde, stained with benzidine, counted, and expressed as a mean of 8 replicates. The CFU-GM colonies were stimulated with pooled serum from endotoxin-treated dogs and incubated for 8 days at 37 C in 10% CO2. Using an inverted microscope, the CFU-GM colonies were counted and expressed as a mean of 6 replicates. The number of colonies was proportional to the plated cell concentrations. The addition of 10% autologous serum to CFU-GM cultures increased the number of colonies by 80 to 100%, but markedly reduced the size and number of CFU-E colonies. The marrow cloning capacity among dogs of comparable age was similar, and little variation was noticed when bone marrow cells from the same dogs were cultured repeatedly over a period of 3 to 4 months. We concluded that these cloning assays are fast, reliable, and reproducible and that they allow quantitative determination of canine hematopoietic progenitor cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2012,22649065,Gene regulation of UDP-galactose synthesis and transport: potential rate-limiting processes in initiation of milk production in humans.,"Lactose synthesis is believed to be rate limiting for milk production. However, understanding the molecular events controlling lactose synthesis in humans is still rudimentary. We have utilized our established model of the RNA isolated from breast milk fat globule from seven healthy, exclusively breastfeeding women from 6 h to 42 days following delivery to determine the temporal coordination of changes in gene expression in the carbohydrate metabolic processes emphasizing the lactose synthesis pathway in human mammary epithelial cell. We showed that milk lactose concentrations increased from 75 to 200 mM from 6 to 96 h. Milk progesterone concentrations fell by 65% at 24 h and were undetectable by day 3. Milk prolactin peaked at 36 h and then declined progressively afterward. In concordance with lactose synthesis, gene expression of galactose kinase 2, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2), and phosphoglucomutase 1 increased 18-, 10-, and threefold, respectively, between 6 and 72 h. Between 6 and 96 h, gene expression of UDP-galactose transporter 2 (SLC35A2) increased threefold, whereas glucose transporter 1 was unchanged. Gene expression of lactose synthase no. 3 increased 1.7-fold by 96 h, whereas α-lactalbumin did not change over the entire study duration. Gene expression of prolactin receptor (PRLR) and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription complex 5 (STAT5) were increased 10- and 2.5-fold, respectively, by 72 h. In summary, lactose synthesis paralleled the induction of gene expression of proteins involved in UDP-galactose synthesis and transport, suggesting that they are potentially rate limiting in lactose synthesis and thus milk production. Progesterone withdrawal may be the signal that triggers PRLR signaling via STAT5, which may in turn induce UGP2 and SLC35A2 expression."
2012,21906701,The enhanced modulation of key bone matrix components by modified Titanium implant surfaces.,"Modifications to Titanium (Ti) implant surfaces enhance osseointegration by promoting bone-implant contact and peri-implant bone accrual; which in vitro analyses of osteoblastic cells suggest is due to an enhancement in cellular phenotypic maturation and function. To evaluate these effects on uncommitted cells, this study examined the osteogenic mineralisation and phenotypic marker expression of human marrow derived stromal cells (hBMSCs) from three unrelated donors cultured on tissue culture plastic (TCP), polished (P), rough-hydrophobic (SLA) and rough-hydrophilic (modSLA) Ti surfaces over the course of 21 days. Transcriptional analyses indicated a significant early up-regulation of both Runx2 (p<0.05) and Osteopontin (OP) (p<0.05) but not Bone Sialoprotein 2 (BSP2) (p<0.05) by rough surfaces 1 day post seeding. The phenotypic analyses showed that whilst cellular proliferation was relatively restricted and slower on the rough substrates; osteogenic mineralisation, assessed by quantifying extracellular matrix calcium deposition, collagen formation and the ratio of collagen to mineral deposited were significantly higher (p<0.05); as was alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (p<0.05). The rough surfaces caused an increase of secreted osteoblastic markers Osteoprotegrin (OPG) (p<0.05), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) (p<0.05) and Osteocalcin (OC) (p<0.05). These findings suggest that modified Ti surfaces induce an enhancement in osteogenic commitment and differentiation, which likely underlie the deposition of more stable bone matrix early in the healing process in vivo."
2006,16254140,131I-anti-CD45 antibody plus busulfan and cyclophosphamide before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in first remission.,"In an attempt to improve outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we conducted a phase 1/2 study in which targeted irradiation delivered by 131I-anti-CD45 antibody was combined with targeted busulfan (BU; area-under-curve, 600-900 ng/mL) and cyclophosphamide (CY; 120 mg/kg). Fifty-two (88%) of 59 patients receiving a trace 131I-labeled dose of 0.5 mg/kg anti-CD45 murine antibody had higher estimated absorbed radiation in bone marrow and spleen than in any other organ. Forty-six patients were treated with 102 to 298 mCi (3774-11 026 MBq) 131I, delivering an estimated 5.3 to 19 (mean, 11.3) Gy to marrow, 17-72 (mean, 29.7) Gy to spleen, and 3.5 Gy (n = 4) to 5.25 Gy (n = 42) to the liver. The estimated 3-year nonrelapse mortality and disease-free survival (DFS) were 21% and 61%, respectively. These results were compared with those from 509 similar International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry patients who underwent transplantation using BU/CY alone. After adjusting for differences in age and cytogenetics risk, the hazard of mortality among all antibody-treated patients was 0.65 times that of the Registry patients (95% CI 0.39-1.08; P = .09). The addition of targeted hematopoietic irradiation to conventional BU/CY is feasible and well tolerated, and phase 2 results are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further study."
1993,27280999,Characteristic and Localization of the Monitor Peptide Receptor.,"The monitor peptide receptor in the small intestine was investigated. The receptor is on the intestinal mucosal cells [Biochem. J., in press]. The specific binding of the (125)I labeled monitor peptide to dispersed rat small intestinal cells was inhibited by treatment with p-toluensulfonyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), an affinity labeling reagent for trypsin. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) did not inhibit the binding. Analysis with reduced SDS electrophoresis-autoradiography indicated that an affinity-cross-linked complex of the (125)I labeled monitor peptide and the receptor was abolished by the TLCK treatment but was not affected by the presence of SBTI. Histochemical studies found a predominatnt binding of (125)I labeled monitor peptide on cholecystokinin (CCK)-immunoreactive cells in tissue sections of the rat upper intestine. The result suggests that the monitor peptide receptor is on the surface of CCK-producing cells. "
2015,24849036,"Antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and profibrinolytic activities of baicalin.","Baicalin is a flavonoid compound purified from the medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities. However, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and profibrinolytic properties of baicalin have not been studied. In this study, the anticoagulant and antiplatelet activities of baicalin were measured by monitoring activated partial thromboplastin-time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), the activities of cell-based thrombin and activated factor X (FXa), platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. The effects of baicalin on the expressions of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were also tested in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our data showed that baicalin inhibited thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization and platelet functions, prolonged aPTT and PT significantly and inhibited the activities and production of thrombin and FXa. Baicalin also prolonged in vivo bleeding time and inhibited TNF-α induced PAI-1 production. Furthermore, PAI-1/t-PA ratio was significantly decreased by baicalin. Collectively, these results indicate that baicalin possesses antithrombotic activities and suggest that the current study could provide bases for the development of new anticoagulant agents. "
2005,15744087,Berberine synergy with amphotericin B against disseminated candidiasis in mice.,"In present study, we investigated the synergic effect of berberine against disseminated candidiasis caused by the pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans. Berberine inhibited the growth of C. albicans under in-vitro condition. The broth susceptibility revealed the synergic effect of berberine with amphotericin B (Amp B). To confirm these results under the in-vivo condition, the effect was examined in mice against disseminated candidiasis. Results showed mice that were given diluent (negative control), Amp B (0.5 mg/kg of body weight), or berberine (1 mg/kg of body weight) had mean survival times (MST) of approximately 12, 14, and 17 d, respectively. On the contrary, mice that were treated using a combination of the two agents at the same concentrations resulted in a MST value of 36 d, surviving at an average of 22 d longer than the mice group treated only with the Amp B. This MST value was almost same as MST value from the mice that were given four times the Amp B dose. These data indicate that the combination of Amp B and berberine could reduce approximately 75% of the Amp B dose, implying that berberine indeed has synergy with Amp B against the disseminated disease."
2018,29709909,Induction of Apoptosis by Citrus unshiu Peel in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells: Involvement of ROS-Dependent Activation of AMPK.,"The fruit of Citrus unshiu MARKOVICH used for various purposes in traditional medicine has various pharmacological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects. Recently, the possibility of anti-cancer activity of the extracts or components of this fruit has been reported; however, the exact mechanism has not yet been fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effect of water extract of C. unshiu peel (WECU) on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and investigated the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that reduction of MCF-7 cell survival by WECU was associated with the induction of apoptosis. WECU-induced apoptotic cell death was related to the activation of caspase-8 and -9, representative initiate caspases of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, respectively, and increase in the Bax : Bcl-2 ratio accompanied by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). WECU also increased the mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target molecule, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, were activated in a concentration-dependent manner in WECU-treated cells. In contrast, compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, significantly inhibited WECU-induced apoptosis, while inhibiting increased expression of Bax and decreased expression of Bcl-2 by WECU and inhibition of WECU-induced PARP degradation. Furthermore, WECU provoked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the activation of AMKP and apoptosis by WECU were prevented, when the ROS production was blocked by antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Therefore, our data indicate that WECU suppresses MCF-7 cell proliferation by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways through ROS-dependent AMPK pathway activation."
2009,20099464,Solar and artificial ultraviolet-B induced erythrocytes hemolysis with photosensitizers.,"Aim of this study was to monitor the solar ultraviolet-B intensity and to compare the phototoxic effect of different intensity of natural and artificial ultraviolet-B on human red blood cells in presence of compounds as riboflavin and chloroquine. Photohemolysis of erythrocytes was studied under natural solar radiation and artificial ultraviolet-B radiation of 312 nm. Monitoring of solar ultraviolet-B radiation was performed in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. Level of solar ultraviolet-B measured show seasonal and altitudinal variations. Monthly average of solar UV-B intensity was minimum in the month of December and January (0.299 mw/cm2) and maximum in the month of July and August (1.027 mw/cm2). Natural solar radiation intensities 0.402 mw/cm2 and 0.824 mw/cm2 of the month of January and June were used in the photohemolysis experiment. Two intensities of artificial UV-B i.e. 0.824 mw/cm2 and a double intensity 1.65 mw/cm2 were also used. Results on human erythrocytes hemolysis indicate that haemolysis was highest i.e. 71% in chloroquine + artificial ultraviolet-B intensity (1.65 mw/cm2) followed by 62% in chloroquine + artificial ultraviolet-B (0.824 mw/cm2) exposed groups and 54% in natural solar radiation intensity 0.824 mw/cm + chloroquine. Natural solar UV-B alone caused 17% hemolysis and show dose response relationship. A difference in phototoxicity was observed in natural solar and artificial UV-B of same intensity. Artificial UV-B was found more toxic. Riboflavin was more phototoxic in presence of solar light, while chloroquine was more phototoxic with artificial UV-B."
,24406363,[Emergent drugs (III): hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms].,"An increase in the consumption of vegetable substances with a hallucinogenic effect has been observed. Some of these substances are associated with ancestral religious ceremonies, while many of them are legal or are partially regulated. Salvia divinorum is a powerful kappa receptor agonist, with dissociative and hallucinogenic properties, which start quickly and have a short duration. Kratom (Mytragyna speciosa) has mitragynine as its principal alkaloid, with stimulating effects at low doses (coke-like effect), and sedative effects (opiate-like effect) at high doses. Several deaths from its consumption have been detected. The consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears in cyclic form, although there has been increase in their online offer. They are consumed in search of their hallucinogenic effects, above all those belonging to the family of psilocybes, which contain tryptamines with a hallucinogenic effect similar to LSD. Peyote (Lophophora psilocybes), a cactus rich in mescaline (trimetoxifeniletilamina), produces hallucinations of the five senses, and forms part of the religious culture of the North American Indians. Daturas, which are ubiquitous, produce anticholinergic symptoms and effects on the central nervous system (delirium, hallucinations, etc.), due to their high atropine and scopolamine content. Other substances used for their hallucinogenic effects include the drink known as ayahuasca, and seeds for preparing infusions like Ololiuqui, Morning Glory (Ipomoea violacea), Hawaian Baby Woodrose (Argyreia nervosa), Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala) and Iboga Rootbark (Tabernanthe iboga).

2000,10918950,Role of guanylyl cyclase activation via thiamine in suppressing chemically-induced writhing in mouse.,"The possible role of L-arginine/nitric oxide (L-arginine/NO) pathway in the antinociceptive activity of thiamine (vitamin B1) in p-benzoquinone-induced mouse writhing model was investigated. Thiamine (ED50, 0.11 mg/kg), L-arginine (50 mg/kg), NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 75 mg/kg) and morphine (ED50: 0.13 mg/kg) displayed antinociceptions following s.c. administrations (52.4 +/- 5.5%, 36.8 +/- 7.7%, 27.8 +/- 11.1%, 66.1 +/- 3.5%, respectively). However, methylene blue (MB, 40 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a nociception (-32.1 +/- 9.9%). Coadministration of B1 with L-arginine did not significantly change L-arginine-induced antinociception (48.9 +/- 3.7%). Cotreatment of thiamine with L-NAME and MB significantly increased the L-NAME-induced antinociception (53.9 +/- 3.9%) and reversed the MB-induced nociception to antinociception (46.0 +/- 4.2%). L-Arginine and L-NAME-induced antinociceptions were significantly increased (55.9 +/- 3.9% and 61.1 +/- 5.0%, respectively) by morphine. MB-induced nociception significantly reversed to antinociception by the concomitant administration of morphine (41.6 +/- 8.9%). Thiamine and morphine coadministration displayed antinociception (46.0 +/- 4.2%). The present results suggest that thiamine could produce antinociception by the activation of guanylyl cyclase mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that may trigger the possible involvement of central and/or peripheral L-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway."
2019,31449276,"Ameliorative Effects of Hydromethanolic Extract of Citrullus lanatus (Watermelon) Rind on Semen Parameters, Reproductive Hormones and Testicular Oxidative Status Following Nicotine Administration in Male Wistar Rats.","The present study examines the possible ameliorative effects of the hydromethanolic extract of Citrullus lanatus rind (HECL) on some reproductive function and oxidative indices of the testes in male Wistar rats following administration of nicotine. Twenty male rats were assigned into four groups: Group A to D of five rats each. Group A served as control and received 2ml/kg body weight of 10% extract vehicle; Group B received 1mg/kg body weight of nicotine; Group C were co-administered 1mg/kg body weight nicotine and 500 mg/kg body weight of HECL and Group D received only 500mg/kg body weight of HECL. The drugs and extracts were administered orally to the rats for 42days; blood samples were collected by direct cardiac puncture for determination of serum concentrations of testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone. The testes were also harvested for determination of semen parameters: motility, morphology, viability and count and testicular tissue processed for superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde concentration. Compared to Group A control rats, administration of HECL significantly increased sperm count and reproductive hormone concentrations amongst Group B rats (p<0.05). Treatment with nicotine caused a significant reduction in the levels of all reproductive hormones with significant diminution of some sperm parameters: motility, morphology and viability; and decrease in superoxide dismutase and increase in malondialdehyde concentration amongst Group B rats compared to Group A control rats (p<0.05). Co-administration of HECL with nicotine to Group C rats apparently reversed the effects of nicotine resulting in significant increases in sperm count and the reproductive hormones concentration as compared to Group A control rats (p<0.05). Amongst Group D rats, the extract also caused a significant increase in superoxide dismutase concentration and a significant decrease in malondialdehyde concentration compared with the Group A control rats (p<0.05). The findings suggest that the hydromethanolic extract of Citrullus lanatus rind possibly ameliorates the deleterious effects of nicotine on some reproductive indices in male Wistar rats."
2010,20554107,Hericium erinaceus enhances doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"It has been demonstrated that the Hericium erinaceus (HE) mushroom, which primarily consists of polysaccharides, possesses anti-tumor activities. However, the mechanisms by which HE inhibits human hepatocellular carcinoma growth remain unknown. Our study demonstrates that HE acts as an enhancer to sensitize doxorubicin (Dox)-mediated apoptotic signaling, and this sensitization can be achieved by reducing c-FLIP expression via JNK activation and enhancing intracellular Dox accumulation via the inhibition of NF-κB activity. These findings suggest that HE in combination with Dox serves as an effective tool for treating drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma."
2001,11418466,Platelet characteristics in patients with X-linked macrothrombocytopenia because of a novel GATA1 mutation.,"A new mutation is described in the X-linked gene GATA1, resulting in macrothrombocytopenia and mild dyserythropoietic features but no marked anemia in a 4-generation family. The molecular basis for the observed phenotype is a substitution of glycine for aspartate in the strictly conserved codon 218 (D218G) of the amino-terminal zinc finger loop of the transcription factor GATA1. Zinc finger interaction studies demonstrated that this mutation results in a weak loss of affinity of GATA1 for its essential cofactor FOG1, whereas direct D218G-GATA1 binding to DNA was normal. The phenotypic effects of this mutation in the patients' platelets have been studied. Semiquantitative RNA analysis, normalized for beta-actin messenger RNA, showed extremely low transcription of the GATA1 target genes GPIbbeta and GPIX but also a significantly lower expression of the nondirectly GATA1-regulated Gsalpha gene, suggestive of incomplete megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, GPIIIa expression was close to normal in agreement with its early appearance during megakaryocyte differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of patient platelets confirmed the existence of a platelet population with abnormal size distribution and reduced GPIb complex levels but with normal GPIIIa expression. It also showed the presence of very immature platelets lacking almost all membrane glycoproteins studied (GPIbalpha, GPIbbeta, GPIIIa, GPIX, and GPV). Patients' platelets showed weak ristocetin-induced agglutination, compatible with the disturbed GPIb complex. Accordingly, electron microscopy of the patients' platelets revealed giant platelets with cytoplasmic clusters consisting of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and abnormal membrane complexes. In conclusion, GATA1 mutations can lead to isolated X-linked macrothrombocytopenia without anemia."
2013,23615963,Resolution of the direct interaction with and inhibition of the human GLUT1 hexose transporter by resveratrol from its effect on glucose accumulation.,"Resveratrol acts as a chemopreventive agent for cancer and as a potential antiobesity and antidiabetic compound, by leading to reduced body fat and improved glucose homeostasis. The exact mechanisms involved in improving hyperglycemic state are not known, but most of the glucose uptake into mammalian cells is facilitated by the GLUT hexose transporters. Resveratrol is structurally similar to isoflavones such as genistein, which inhibit the glucose uptake facilitated by the GLUT1 hexose transporter. Here we examined the direct effects of resveratrol on glucose uptake and accumulation in HL-60 and U-937 leukemic cell lines, which express mainly GLUT1, under conditions that discriminate transport from the intracellular substrate phosphorylation/accumulation. Resveratrol blocks GLUT1-mediated hexose uptake and thereby affects substrate accumulation on these cells. Consequently, we characterized the mechanism involved in inhibition of glucose uptake in human red cells. Resveratrol inhibits glucose exit in human red cells, and the displacement of previously bound cytochalasin B revealed the direct interaction of resveratrol with GLUT1. Resveratrol behaves as a competitive blocker of glucose uptake under zero-trans exit and exchange kinetic assays, but it becomes a mixed noncompetitive blocker when zero-trans entry transport was assayed, suggesting that the binding site for resveratrol lies on the endofacial face of the transporter. We propose that resveratrol interacts directly with the human GLUT1 hexose transporter by binding to an endofacial site and that this interaction inhibits the transport of hexoses across the plasma membrane. This inhibition is distinct from the effect of resveratrol on the intracellular phosphorylation/accumulation of glucose. "
2015,25466122,Quantitative assessment of bioactive compounds and the antioxidant activity of 15 jujube cultivars.,"Fifteen jujube cultivars late in their maturation were analysed in the red stage for bioactive compounds; including total phenolics (bound/free), total flavonoids, total polysaccharides, ascorbic acid, total triterpenes, proanthocyanidins and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid) (ABTS(+)) scavenging methods and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution method (TOPSIS) was employed to evaluate the nutrition of different jujube cultivars based on their bioactive compounds. The results indicated that the contents of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities vary between different jujube cultivars. Correlation analysis revealed that ascorbic acid, polyphenols and proanthocyanidins were the 3 main components responsible for the antioxidant activity of jujubes. TOPSIS analysis indicated that Zyzyphus jujube cv. Nanjingyazao ranks the highest of the 15 jujube fruits with regards to nutritional value. "

2019,29958039,Gelidiella acerosa Exhibits Neuroprotective Effect Against Amyloid Beta 25-35 Peptide-Induced Toxicity in PC12 Cells.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple pathological consequences such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, cholinergic deficit, amyloid plaques, and tangles formation. Hence, development of drugs with multiple targets will be effective in the treatment of AD. The present study aims at evaluation of the neuroprotective effect of Gelidiella acerosa against amyloid beta 25-35 (Aβ 25-35) induced toxicity in PC12 cells. The antioxidative effect was evaluated by monitoring levels of antioxidant enzymes. Protection against ROS-induced damage was assessed by the measurement of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content (PCC), 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence, and nitric oxide (NO) production. The cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activity was also evaluated. The antiapoptotic activity was verified by caspase-3 activity. The results of antioxidant assays suggest that G. acerosa significantly (P < .05) restores the levels of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the seaweed extract was found to prevent the formation of intracellular ROS induced by Aβ 25-35 and thereby protects PC12 cells from macromolecular damage. The study demonstrated that G. acerosa inhibits ChE activity significantly (P < .05) in PC12 cells. The significant decrease (P < .05) in the level of caspase-3 activity indicates that the seaweed has anti-apoptotic activity. Hence, the outcome of this study signifies the neuroprotective effect of G. acerosa targeting multiple pathological consequences of AD."
1993,8373139,Modulation of rat and human lymphocyte function by n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and acetylsalicylic acid.,"The effects of in vitro additions of between 10 and 100 microM n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were examined on the proliferation of stimulated T lymphocytes in culture. For both phytohemagglutinin-induced human blood lymphocytes and concanavalin-A-induced rat splenic lymphocytes, the largest inhibitory effects were obtained with 22:4 n-6 and 22:6 n-3, and to a lesser extent with 20:5 n-3. Arachidonic acid 20:4 n-6, the main eicosanoid precursor, was not inhibitory, it even stimulated rat lymphocyte proliferation. Acetylsalicylic acid stimulated both human and rat lymphocyte proliferation. The effects of moderate decreases in the dietary n-6/n-3 ratio by either linseed oil or fish oil maximum eicosapentaenoic acid (MaxEPA) were determined on rat lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell activity in vitro. Dietary changes did not affect mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, but proliferation of unstimulated lymphocytes was significantly lowered (4-fold) with the n-3-enriched diets. Dietary fish oil but not linseed oil significantly increased the NK cell activity of rat splenic lymphocytes. The n-3-enriched diets, especially the fish oil diets, reduced the stimulatory effect of in vitro added acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) on lymphocyte proliferation."
1998,9493577,Impaired haemostasis by intravenous administration of a gelatin-based plasma expander in human subjects.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gelatin-based plasma expander on blood coagulation and haemostasis in human subjects. Six healthy men were studied in a randomised, controlled cross-over study to investigate the effects of a 60 min intravenous infusion of either 1 l gelatin-based plasma substitute (Gelofusine) or 0.9% NaCl (control). The infusion of gelatin resulted in a 1.7 fold increase in bleeding time at 60 min and a 1.4 fold increase at 120 min, while saline had no effect (p <0.05). Aggregation studies revealed a significant impairment of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (p <0.05), associated with a substantial decrease of vWF:ag (-32% vs. -5%, p <0.05) and ristocetin co-factor (-29% vs. +1%, p <0.05) and without in vitro impairment of the platelet glycoprotein 1b receptor. Gelatin caused a decrease in thrombin-antithrombin complexes (-45% vs. -4%, p <0.05) and F1+2 (-40% vs. +1%, p <0.05). The decrease in circulating levels of vWF:ag, vWF R:Co, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and F1+2 was more than could be expected by the calculated plasma-dilution generated by Gelofusine. Our results demonstrated that the administration of a gelatin-based plasma substitute results in a significant impairment of primary haemostasis and thrombin generation. The defect in primary haemostasis appears to be related to a gelatin-induced reduction in von Willebrand factor, whereas the decreased thrombin generation may be due to the dilution of coagulation factors induced by Gelofusine."
2007,17300845,Study on preparation and activity of a novel recombinant human parathyroid hormone(1-34) analog with N-terminal Pro-Pro extension.,"A recombinant human parathyroid hormone fragment, Pro-Pro-hPTH(1-34), with molecular weight of 4311.46 was acquired through gene engineering. It was then isolated and purified. The homogeneity of this fragment was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC), isoelectronic focusing (IEF) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry(MS) methods. Its isoelectric point is 8.0 which was determined by IEF. It was found that the hormone fragment significantly induced calcium increment as compared to the control group (P<0.001) in Parsons's Chicken Assay, an established bioassay for the evaluation of the PTH effect. After the 3-month-old ovariectomized (OVXed) rats, the OVXed rat is one of the two models required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the preclinical assessment of drugs for treating osteoporosis [DeLuca PP, Dani BA. Skeletal effects of parathyroid hormone (1-34) in ovariectomized rats with or without concurrent administration of salmon calcitonin. Am Assoc Pharm Sci 2001;3(4):E27 [1]]. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 14 weeks, daily subcutaneous injections of Pro-Pro-hPTH(1-34) for 16 weeks (0.4, 0.6 or 0.9 nmol/100 g body weight), reduced the ovariectomy (OVX)-triggered mass loss of vertebral trabecular bone. The mean Bone Material Density (BMD) increased to 29.2-34.5% in 3-month-old OVXed rats compared to control-vehicle group (P<0.001) and increased to 17.5-22.3% compared to sham-operated groups (P<0.01). In short, A recombinant Pro-Pro-hPTH(1-34) was harvested in purified form and its physico-chemical characterization was determined. It showed significantly enhanced activity upon two typical models for PTH fragments. It can increase the mineral density of vertebral trabecular bone just as synthetic hPTH(1-34), and the functional activity of Pro-Pro-hPTH(1-34) should be due to the removing of Pro-Pro- by Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). This study opened out a simplified method which was cheaper, faster than the conventional one for producing active hPTH fragment, and its applied prospect would be good; Furthermore, it may open up our own path in finding new methods for post-processing of gene-engineering product."
2000,10902065,Potential interactions between alternative therapies and warfarin.,"Potential and documented interactions between alternative therapy agents and warfarin are discussed. An estimated one third of adults in the United States use alternative therapies, including herbs. A major safety concern is potential interactions of alternative medicine products with prescription medications. This issue is especially important with respect to drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes, such as warfarin. Herbal products that may potentially increase the risk of bleeding or potentiate the effects of warfarin therapy include angelica root, arnica flower, anise, asafoetida, bogbean, borage seed oil, bromelain, capsicum, celery, chamomile, clove, fenugreek, feverfew, garlic, ginger ginkgo, horse chestnut, licorice root, lovage root, meadowsweet, onion, parsley, passionflower herb, poplar, quassia, red clover, rue, sweet clover, turmeric, and willow bark. Products that have been associated with documented reports of potential interactions with warfarin include coenzyme Q10, danshen, devil's claw, dong quai, ginseng, green tea, papain, and vitamin E. Interpretation of the available information on herb-warfarin interactions is difficult because nearly all of it is based on in vitro data, animal studies, or individual case reports. More study is needed to confirm and assess the clinical significance of these potential interactions. There is evidence that a wide range of alternative therapy products have the potential to interact with warfarin. Pharmacists and other health care professionals should question all patients about use of alternative therapies and report documented interactions to FDA's MedWatch program."
2016,27080891,The effects of pH and copper on the formation of volatile sulfur compounds in Chardonnay and Shiraz wines post-bottling.,"The effects of pH and Cu(2+) treatment on the formation of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) were investigated in Chardonnay and Shiraz wine samples. Four VSCs were significantly affected by pH, with lower wine pH associated with decreased hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide concentrations. The effects of pH and Cu(2+) on H2S formation from known precursor compounds were subsequently studied in a model wine system. In samples treated with cysteine and glutathione lower pH produced less H2S. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to study the effects of variable pH concentrations in a model system containing Cu(2+), tartaric acid, and H2S. Differences in Cu(2)(+)-tartrate complexes particle size and concentration were measured as a function of pH and H2S addition, suggesting the type of complexes formed may affect the binding sites of Cu(2+) available to catalyse the formation of VSCs such as H2S.

2012,22968460,Prothrombin activation in blood coagulation: the erythrocyte contribution to thrombin generation.,"Prothrombin activation can proceed through the intermediates meizothrombin or prethrombin-2. To assess the contributions that these 2 intermediates make to prothrombin activation in tissue factor (Tf)-activated blood, immunoassays were developed that measure the meizothrombin antithrombin (mTAT) and α-thrombin antithrombin (αTAT) complexes. We determined that Tf-activated blood produced both αTAT and mTAT. The presence of mTAT suggested that nonplatelet surfaces were contributing to approximately 35% of prothrombin activation. Corn trypsin inhibitor-treated blood was fractionated to yield red blood cells (RBCs), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and buffy coat. Compared with blood, PRP reconstituted with PPP to a physiologic platelet concentration showed a 2-fold prolongation in the initiation phase and a marked decrease in the rate and extent of αTAT formation. Only the addition of RBCs to PRP was capable of normalizing αTAT generation. FACS on glycophorin A-positive cells showed that approximately 0.6% of the RBC population expresses phosphatidylserine and binds prothrombinase (FITC Xa·factor Va). These data indicate that RBCs participate in thrombin generation in Tf-activated blood, producing a membrane that supports prothrombin activation through the meizothrombin pathway."
2012,22257149,Drug interactions with herbal medicines.,"In recent years, the issue of herbal medicine-drug interactions has generated significant concern. Such interactions can increase the risk for an individual patient, especially with regard to drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin, ciclosporin and digoxin). The present article summarizes herbal medicine-drug interactions involving mainly inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes and/or drug transporters. An increasing number of in vitro and animal studies, case reports and clinical trials evaluating such interactions have been reported, and the majority of the interactions may be difficult to predict. Potential pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interactions of commonly used herbal medicines (black cohosh, garlic, Ginkgo, goldenseal, kava, milk thistle, Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, saw palmetto and St John's wort) with conventional drugs are presented, and sometimes the results are contradictory. Clinical implications of herbal medicine-drug interactions depend on a variety of factors, such as the co-administered drugs, the patient characteristics, the origin of the herbal medicines, the composition of their constituents and the applied dosage regimens. To optimize the use of herbal medicines, further controlled studies are urgently needed to explore their potential for interactions with conventional drugs and to delineate the underlying mechanisms."
2008,18204840,Inhibition of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1 by dietary phytochemicals.,"For the development of a safe and effective dual inhibitor of anticancer drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) to conquer multidrug resistance, we investigated the effects of dietary phytochemicals on the functions of P-glycoprotein and MRP1.The effects of dietary phytochemicals on the functions of P-glycoprotein and MRP1 were investigated using P-glycoprotein-overexpressing human carcinoma KB-C2 cells and human MRP1 gene-transfected KB/MRP cells. The effects of natural compounds found in dietary supplements, herbs, and foods such as sesame, ginkgo, soybean, and licorice were evaluated.The accumulation of daunorubicin, a fluorescent substrate of P-glycoprotein, increased in the presence of sesamin, ginkgolic acid, matairesinol, glycyrrhetinic acid, glabridin, and phyllodulcin in KB-C2 cells. Glycyrrhetinic acid and matairesinol also increased the accumulation of calcein, a fluorescent substrate of MRP1, in KB/MRP cells. KB-C2 and KB/MRP cells were sensitized to anticancer drugs by glycyrrhetinic acid, showing that glycyrrhetinic acid reverses multidrug resistance. The verapamil-stimulated P-glycoprotein ATPase activity was inhibited by glycyrrhetinic acid. Glycyrrhetinic acid stimulated the ATPase activity of MRP1.These results suggest that dietary phytochemicals, such as glycyrrhetinic acid found in licorice, have dual inhibitory effects on P-glycoprotein and MRP1 and might become useful to enhance the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy."
2008,18662850,Yeast as a model system for identification of metabolic targets of a 'glucosamine complex' used as a therapeutic agent of osteoarthritis.,"This manuscript describes the effect of a glucosamine complex and its different constituents on the metabolism of yeast cells. Indeed, the yeast model biosystem offers important advantages in the understanding of basic cellular and molecular processes. For example, the possibility to differentiate aerobic and anaerobic metabolism allows the measurement of glycolysis and mitochondria importance in the control of energetic metabolism and stress-responsive. Yeast growth and division can be controlled efficiently and effectively by adjusting environmental conditions that mimic some aspect of those experienced by chondrocytes in an osteoarthritic milieu, such as low oxygen and nutriment availabilities, high oxidative stress, etc. The glucosamine complex or some of its components (glucosamine sulphate, MSM, Ribes nigrum and silicon) enhanced cellular proliferation and CO(2) production of yeast cells cultured under severe conditions. In addition, it allows a larger output of protons from the cells into the medium. Glucosamine complex supplementation also boosted cellular resistance to stresses such as heat shock, H(2)O(2)-induced peroxidation and ethanol. The beneficial effects of the complex were primarily due to R. nigrum and to glucosamine sulphate components. The protective effect of the glucosamine complex can be explained by an increase of cellular energy level through intensification of mitochondrial functionality and intracellular machinery (anaerobic glycolysis). An additional effect on protein kinase activation is not unlikely."
1992,1450406,Interleukin-11 promotes accessory cell-dependent B-cell differentiation in humans.,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a recently described stromal-derived cytokine that supports the growth of an IL-6-dependent murine plasmacytoma line in the presence of antibody to IL-6 and appears to act in a manner similar to IL-6 on hematopoietic stem cells. Because IL-6 is known to promote differentiation of normal human B cells, the role of IL-11 on B-cell differentiation in vitro was characterized. IL-11 does not result in significantly increased DNA synthesis or Ig secretion by purified B cells alone or B cells cultured with Staphylococcus Cowan I, a T-cell-independent B-cell mitogen. In contrast, purified B cells cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), irradiated T cells, and monocytes show increased DNA synthesis at day 3 and increased IgG and IgM secretion at day 7 of culture; addition of IL-11 further augments Ig secretion without change in DNA synthesis, an effect that can only be partially blocked by monoclonal antibody to IL-6. Similar experiments confirmed that increased IgG secretion was demonstrable when either IL-11 or IL-6 was added to B cells + CD4+/45RA- T cells + monocytes + PWM; in contrast, Ig secretion was low and equivalent when CD4+/45RA+ T cells were cultured with B cells+monocytes+PWM with or without IL-6 or IL-11. Neither IL-6 nor IL-11 could significantly increase phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced DNA synthesis by CD4+/45RA- or CD4+/45RA+ T cells. Although PWM or IL-11 induced IL-6 mRNA expression in both CD4+/45RA- T cells and monocytes, in neither cell did IL-11 increase IL-6 mRNA expression over that noted to PWM alone. These observations support the view that IL-11 promotes differentiation of human B lymphocytes only in the presence of accessory T cells and monocytes and that a minor component of this effect may be through stimulation of IL-6 production by CD4+/45RA- T cells and monocytes."
2018,29776437,Coenzyme Q10 combined with trimetazidine in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with coronary heart disease complicated with renal dysfunction undergoing elective cardiac catheterization: a randomized control study and in vivo study.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the common hospital-acquired acute renal failures. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and trimetazidine (TMZ) can prevent the occurrence of CIN after elective cardiac catheterization in patients with coronary artery disease complicated with renal dysfunction.Consecutive coronary artery disease patients with renal insufficiency scheduled for coronary angiography were enrolled in randomized, paralleled, double-blind, controlled trial. The development of CIN was occurrence at the 48 or 72 h after the procedure. The changes of serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, and Cys-C within 72 h after the procedure were measured and compared. In vivo contrast medium (CM)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) animal model was established, and CoQ10 plus TMZ was orally administrated to evaluate its renal protective effect.150 patients with renal insufficiency were enrolled finally. CIN occurred in 21 (14.00%) of the 150 patients. 72 h after the procedure, the incidence of CIN was significantly lower in CoQ10 plus TMZ group compared with control group (6.67 vs. 21.3%, p = 0.01). No cardiac death occurred in this study. No side effects were observed after administration of CoQ10 and TMZ. In vivo test demonstrated that CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and SCR induced by CM i.v. injection, as well as tubular pathological injuries. Meanwhile, CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the oxidation stress in kidneys from CM-AKI animals.CoQ10 plus TMZ could decrease the incidence of CIN in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, and their effect may be due to its strong anti-oxidation effect."
2019,30590320,Baicalin relaxes vascular smooth muscle and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is an extensively used medicinal herb for the treatment of hypertension in traditional Chinese medicine. Baicalin is the most abundant flavone compound present in Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and endothelium-dependent vascular activities of baicalin have been suggested. However, the pharmacological implications and mechanisms of baicalin under hypertensive conditions remain to be investigated. The current study examined the blood pressure-lowering effect of baicalin in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. Moreover, vascular activities and mechanisms of baicalin were investigated under hypertensive conditions. The results demonstrate that baicalin treatment lowers the blood pressure in SHRs in vivo. Ex vivo vascular reactivity assay reveals that baicalin relaxes phenylephrine (PE)-constricted SHR aortas in an endothelium-independent manner. Baicalin attenuates Angiotensin II (Ang II) or potassium chloride (KCl)-induced vasoconstriction in SHR aortas as well. Baicalin also relaxes SHR aortas in the presence of different Ca2+ channel blockers such as nifedipine and SKF96365 in response to PE-induced constriction. Most importantly, ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) blockade partially abrogated the vasorelaxant effect of baicalin. In summary, the current study demonstrates for the first time that intracellular Ca2+ regulation in vascular smooth muscle is mechanistically implicated in the vasorelaxant effect of baicalin under hypertensive conditions. Furthermore, activated KATP channels are in part required for the vasorelaxant effect of baicalin under hypertensive conditions. Thus, the work here sheds novel pharmacological and mechanistic insights into the blood pressure-lowering effect of baicalin, which may help better understand the therapeutic application of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi in the treatment of hypertension."
1992,1484351,[Pharmacological study on Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer. XV. Effects of 70% methanolic extract from red and white ginseng on the antitumor activity of mitomycin C].,"The influence of various fractions and ginsenosides from the 70% methanolic extract (RMe) of Red Ginseng (a steamed and dried root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) on the cytocidal effect of mitomycin C (MMC) against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma was investigated in vitro. The AcOEt soluble portion (RMe-I) showed an increasing effect on the activities of lysosomal enzymes in the cultured tumor cells. RMe-I promoted the uptake of MMC into the tumor cells and enhanced the cytotoxicity of MMC against the cultured tumor cells. 20(S)-, 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 and ginsenoside Rh2 isolated from RMe-I promoted the uptake of MMC into the tumor cells but ginsenosides from the n-BuOH soluble portion (RME-II) had no effect. Furthermore, the influence of RMe and the 70% methanolic extract (WMe) from White Ginseng (a dried root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) on the cytocidal effect of MMC was investigated in vivo. MMC combined with RMe showed stronger antitumor effects against the ascites form of mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and rat ascites hepatoma AH 130 than MMC combined with WMe. The activities of lysosomal enzymes in tumor cells were also more increased in comparison with that combined MMC and WMe."
2012,22665565,A salty cause of severe hypertension.,"A 51-year-old lady was referred to our clinic because of severe hypertension; blood pressure 214/119 mm Hg despite treatment with an angiotensin receptor antagonist and a calcium channel blocker. Her initial laboratory results showed hypokalaemic alkalosis with normal urea and creatinine levels. Her 24-h urinary sodium excretion was markedly elevated at 244 mmol (equivalent to a daily intake of approximately 16 g of salt). Hyperaldosteronism was suspected but her plasma aldosterone level was subsequently found to be normal. On further questioning, the patient admitted to eating considerable amounts of salted liquorice and a diagnosis of acquired apparent mineralocorticoid excess was made. Liquorice has a well-known mineralocorticoid activity as it inhibits the action of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 and can induce mineralocorticoid hypertension. After stopping eating the salted liquorice, the patient's blood pressure quickly normalised and all her antihypertensive medications were stopped."
1994,7517203,Isolation and characterization of human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cells: hematopoietic progenitor cell adhesion.,"To examine potential mechanisms by which hematopoiesis may be regulated by endothelial cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, we have devised a technique for the in vitro study of the interaction of human BM microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) with hematopoietic cells. Microvessels isolated by collagenase digestion of spicules obtained from filtered BM aspirate were plated on gelatin-coated plastic dishes, and colonies of endothelial cells grown from microvessel explants were further purified by Ulex europaeus lectin affinity separation. BMEC monolayers isolated by this technique grew in typical cobblestone fashion, stained positively with antibody to factor VIII/von Willebrand factor, and incorporated acetylated LDL. Immunohistochemical studies showed that BM microvessels and BMEC monolayers express CD34, PECAM, and thrombospondin. Incubation of resting BMEC with BM mononuclear hematopoietic cells resulted in the selective adhesion of relatively large numbers of CD34+ progenitor cells and megakaryocytes. The binding of purified BM-derived CD34+ progenitor cells to BMEC was dependent on divalent cations and was partially blocked by antibodies to CD34. IL-1 beta treatment of BMEC monolayers resulted in an increase of CD34+ progenitor cell adhesion by mechanisms independent of CD34 or divalent cations. BMEC exhibit specific affinity for CD34+ progenitor cells and megakaryocytes, suggesting that the BM microvasculature may play a role in regulating the trafficking, proliferation, and differentiation of lineage specific hematopoietic elements, and possibly of pluripotent stem cells within the CD34+ population."
,11268494,Sequential high dose-density chemotherapy with two active regimens for advanced small cell lung cancer.,"16 patients with advanced small cell lung cancer were treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 day 1), epidoxorubicin (60 mg/m2 day 1) and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 day 1) every 14 days for six cycles followed by a combination of cisplatin (40 mg/m2 days 1 & 2) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 days 1-3) every 14 days for four cycles. Shortening of intervals was obtained with the prophylactic employment of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim, 300 mcg subcutaneously from day 5 to dsy 10). In 11 patients ratio between actually delivered dose intensity and planned dose intensity of > 80% was obtained. Toxicity was acceptable and no life-threatening toxicities were observed. An objective response (partial or complete) was observed in 11 patients. The new regimen, incorporating the concepts of dose-intensification and sequential administration of regimens, is feasible and may be considered for further studies."
2019,30997781,Interactions between Clotrimazole and selected essential oils against Malassezia pachydermatis clinical isolates.,"The aim of this study was to investigate interactions between conventional antifungal drug and essential oils against isolates of Malassezia pachydermatis. Antifungal activity of Cinnamomum cassia, Melaleuca alternifolia, Mentha piperita, Origanum vulgare and Syzygium aromaticum essential oils were tested against 19 strains of M. pachydermatis isolated from healthy dogs and reference strain M. pachydermatis CBS 1879. The checkerboard assay was used to search for in- teractions. Synergism was observed for the combination of clotrimazole with Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil, Mentha piperita and Origanum vulgare. The combinations of Cinnamomum cassia and Syzygium aromaticum essential oils with clotrimazole showed indifferent effect. Additive antimicrobial activity was observed for the combination of clotrimazole with Syzygium aromaticum and Melaleuca alternifolia essential oils against reference strain. The obtained results showed synergistic interactions between essential oils and clotrimazole which could improve effectiveness of this antifungal drug."
2017,27916511,Liqustri lucidi Fructus inhibits hepatic injury and functions as an antioxidant by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro.,"Medicinal herbs are used to treat or prevent various diseases, and function to regulate protective mechanisms as nutraceuticals. Fructus Ligustri lucidi is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum and has been used for its tonic effects on the liver. This study was designed to examine the effects of Fructus Ligustri lucidi water extract (FLL) against severe oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in vivo and in vitro and to elucidate its cellular mechanisms of action. Treatment of HepG2 cells with arachidonic acid (AA) + iron successfully induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as indicated by depletion of glutathione, formation of ROS, decreses in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as procaspase-3 and Bcl-xL. FLL treatment significantly blocked these pathological changes and the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AA + iron, which were similar with the effect of aminoimidazole-carboxamide-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). Moreover, FLL induced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was mediated by its upstream kinase LKB1. Inhibition or activation of AMPK revealed the role of AMPK in cellular protection conferred by FLL in LKB1-deficient cells. In mice, oral administration of 100 mg/kg FLL activated AMPK in the liver, and protected against oxidative stress and liver injury induced by CCl4 injection. Among the components of FLL, chlorogenic acid was found to be responsible for the protection of hepatocytes against AA + iron-induced cellular damage. Overall, our results confirmed that FLL has the ability to protect hepatocytes against oxidative injury through regulation of the AMPK signaling pathway."
2010,20200254,Zinc bioavailability and homeostasis.,"Zinc has earned recognition recently as a micronutrient of outstanding and diverse biological, clinical, and global public health importance. Regulation of absorption by zinc transporters in the enterocyte, together with saturation kinetics of the absorption process into and across the enterocyte, are the principal means by which whole-body zinc homeostasis is maintained. Several physiologic factors, most notably the quantity of zinc ingested, determine the quantity of zinc absorbed and the efficiency of absorption. Other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. Zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption. The principal dietary factor known to impair zinc bioavailability is inositol hexa- (and penta-) phosphate or phytate. Modeling of zinc absorption as a function of dietary zinc and phytate accounts for >80% of the variability in the quantity of zinc absorbed. Fitting the model to new data has resulted in continual improvement in parameter estimates, which currently indicate a maximal absorption in adults of approximately 6 mg Zn/d and that the average estimated dietary requirement doubles with 1000 mg dietary phytate/d. Intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc is regulated in response to recent absorption and to zinc status. The quantitative relation of intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc to zinc absorption is currently considered to be of major importance in the determination of zinc requirements. The effects of phytate on intestinal losses of endogenous zinc merit further investigation but are probably not of the same magnitude as its inhibitory effects on absorption of exogenous zinc."
2004,15447919,Phenotypic expression of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C-->T polymorphism and flavin cofactor availability in thyroid dysfunction.,"The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) 677C-->T polymorphism modifies the risk of coronary artery disease and colon cancer and is related to plasma concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy). Riboflavin status modifies the metabolic effect of the polymorphism, and thyroid hormones increase the synthesis of flavin cofactors.The aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic expression of the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism in terms of plasma tHcy concentrations in patients with thyroid dysfunction.The study population consisted of 182 patients with hyperthyroidism. We studied plasma tHcy in relation to MTHFR genotype, riboflavin, and folate before and during 6 mo of treatment with antithyroid drugs.Before treatment, tHcy was higher in patients with the mutant enzyme than in those with the wild-type enzyme. A genotype effect was observed only at low riboflavin or folate concentrations (P </= 0.05). During treatment, concentrations of flavin cofactors in plasma decreased (P < 0.001), and tHcy increased (P < 0.001). The overall tHcy increase was greatest in patients with the T allele, particularly at low riboflavin concentrations (P = 0.004).Thyroid status affects the phenotypic expression of the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism, possibly by modifying the availability of flavin cofactors."
2013,23952676,Lepidium sativum but not Nigella sativa affects carbamazepine disposition in an animal model.,"Efficacy and safety profile of a drug may be affected when concomitantly used with herbal medicines. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of some commonly used herbal products viz. Nigella sativa (Black seed) and Lepidium sativum (Garden cress) on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ), a narrow therapeutic index drug, in an animal model. In a control group, five rabbits received 40 mg/kg of CBZ orally and blood samples were withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hrs) from a marginal ear vein. After a suitable washout period, an aqueous saline suspension of Nigella sativa (200 mg/kg) or Lepidium sativum (150 mg/kg) was given orally for eight days to the rabbits. On day eight, CBZ (40 mg/kg) was re-administrated orally and blood samples were collected using the same sampling scheme. Drug levels in plasma were determined by liquid chromatography and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. No significant difference was observed in the maximum concentration (Cmax), area under concentration curve (AUC), half-life (T1/2), clearance (Cl/F) and volume of distribution (Vz/F) of CBZ following Nigella sativa treatment. Whereas, increased Cmax, absorption rate measured by the time to Cmax (Tmax), and prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) were observed after the co-administration with Lepidium sativum. Findings of the present study suggest that concurrent use of Lepidium sativum alters the pharmacokinetics of CBZ in an animal model. Further confirmation of these results in humans will warrant changes in CBZ dose and/or frequency before co-administration with these herbal medicines. "
2017,28855474,"Determination of Diniconazole in Agricultural Products, Livestock and Marine Products by LC-MS/MS.","An LC-MS/MS method for the determination of diniconazole in agricultural products, livestock and marine products was developed. Diniconazole in agricultural products was extracted with acetone. The extract was concentrated and partitioned with n-hexane and 10% sodium chloride solution. Agricultural products such as grains and beans were defatted using n-hexane-acetonitrile. Livestock and marine products were extracted with a mixture of acetone and n-hexane, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was defatted using n-hexane-acetonitrile. Cleanup was carried out using a Florisil cartridge column and a graphitized carbon cartridge column for these samples. The LC separation was carried out on an Inertsil ODS-3 column with a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. MS was carried out in the positive ion electrospray ionization mode. The calibration curve was linear between 0.00125 to 0.00750 mg/L. Average recoveries (n=5) of diniconazole from 16 kinds of agricultural products, livestock and marine products fortified at the MRLs (0.01 ppm) were 88.3-108%, and the relative standard deviations were 0.5-5.1%. The limits of quantitation were 0.01 mg/kg."
2013,22995071,"Low dose histone deacetylase inhibitor, LBH589, potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel in epithelial ovarian cancer via PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of combination of LBH589 with docetaxel (DTX) on the growth and survival of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in vitro and the possible mechanisms of chemo-sensitization of LBH589 in the combination treatment. The effect of LBH589 alone or in combination with DTX on four EOC cell lines (OVCAR-3, IGROV-1, A2780 and SKOV-3) was studied by MTT and clonogenic assays, acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining for apoptosis, Western blotting for apoptosis-related proteins, histone H3 and H4 proteins, DNA double strand break (DSB) repair marker and phosphorylation of Akt. LBH589 alone inhibited EOC cell proliferation in a time and dose-dependent manner. Low-dose of LBH589 (IC(20)) combined with DTX had an additive effect and greatly improved efficacy of DTX cell killing in EOC cells. Compared to DTX alone, the combination treatment with LBH589 and DTX induced more apoptosis and led to an increased and persistent DSB. Cell death following single or combined treatment was associated with the release of cytochrome c activity, increased caspase-3 (active) and PARP-1(cleaved), histone acetylation-related proteins and PI3k/Akt signaling pathway. Our results suggest that LBH589 enhances DTX-induced apoptosis in human EOC cells, and can be used in combination with DTX as an attractive strategy for treating human EOC."
2013,23482316,Evaluation of Plantago major L. seed mucilage as a rate controlling matrix for sustained release of propranolol hydrochloride.,"Polysaccharide mucilage derived from the seeds of Plantago major L. (family Plantaginaceae) was investigated for use in matrix formulations containing propranolol hydrochloride. HPMC K4M and tragacanth were used as standards for comparison. The hardness, tensile strength, and friability of tablets increased as the concentration of mucilage increased, indicating good compactibility of mucilage powders. The rate of release of propranolol hydrochloride from P. major mucilage matrices was mainly controlled by the drug/mucilage ratio. Formulations containing P. major mucilage were found to exhibit a release rate comparable to HPMC containing matrices at a lower drug/polymer ratio (drug/HPMC 2:1). These results demonstrated that P. major mucilage is a better release retardant compared to tragacanth at an equivalent content. The results of kinetic analysis showed that in F3 (containing 1:2 drug/mucilage) the highest correlation coefficient was achieved with the zero order model. The swelling and erosion studies revealed that as the proportion of mucilage in tablets was increased, there was a corresponding increase in percent swelling and a decrease in percent erosion of tablets. The DSC and FT-IR studies showed that no formation of complex between the drug and mucilage or changes in crystallinity of the drug had occurred."
2006,16469146,Improvement of the human intestinal flora by ingestion of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus johnsonii La1.,"To exert beneficial effects for the host, for example, improving the intestinal microflora, a probiotic must reach the intestine as a viable strain. These properties must be demonstrated by in vitro as well as in vivo methods. However, only a few well-designed human clinical studies have shown these properties. Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 has been shown to give many beneficial effects for the host, but it is unclear whether a viable strain of L. johnsonii La1 has the effect of improving host intestinal microflora. In the present study, a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial was conducted to elucidate the effect of L. johnsonii La1 on human intestinal microflora. Twenty-two young healthy Japanese women were randomly divided into two groups, and either received fermented milk with L. johnsonii La1 or a fermented milk without L. johnsonii La1 (placebo) daily for 21 d. Consumption of the fermented milk: (a) increased total Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and decreased lecithinase-positive Clostridium in the faeces; (b) increased the faecal lactic acid concentrations; (c) decreased the faecal pH; (d) increased the defecation frequency. These changes were stronger than those observed with the placebo. L. johnsonii La1 was identified in all subjects only after the consumption of the fermented milk. These results suggest that L. johnsonii La1 can contribute to improve intestinal microflora with probiotic properties."
2014,24912703,Obtaining lipases from byproducts of orange juice processing.,"The presence of lipases was observed in three byproducts of orange juice processing: peel, core and frit. The enzymes were characterised biochemically over a wide pH range from neutral (6-7) to alkaline (8-9). The optimal temperature for the activity of these byproducts showed wide range at 20°C to 70°C, indicating fairly high thermostability. The activities were monitored on p-NP-butyrate, p-NP-laurate and p-NP-palmitate. For the first time, lipase activity was detected in these residues, reaching 68.5 lipase U/g for the crude extract from fractions called frit."
1996,8879325,"Stability of baclofen, captopril, diltiazem hydrochloride, dipyridamole, and flecainide acetate in extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.","The stability of drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied. Baclofen 10 mg/mL, captopril 0.75 mg/mL, diltiazem hydrochloride 12 mg/mL, dipyridamole 10 mg/mL, and flecainide acetate 20 mg/mL were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), and cherry syrup and placed in 120-mL amber, clear polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The source of all the drugs was tablets. Six bottles were prepared per liquid; three were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. A sample was removed from each bottle immediately after preparation and at various intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. A mean of at least 92% of the initial drug concentration was retained for up to 60 days in the baclofen, diltiazem hydrochloride, dipyridamole, and flecainide acetate liquids at both 5 and 25 degrees C. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of any of the liquids or in the pH. Baclofen 10 mg/mL, diltiazem hydrochloride 12 mg/mL, dipyridamole 10 mg/mL, and flecainide acetate 20 mg/mL were stable for up to 60 days at 5 and 25 degrees C in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids."
2004,14693544,Antimicrobial activity of a chelatable poly(arginyl-histidine) produced by the ergot fungus Verticillium kibiense.,"We have recently developed a convenient method of screening a broad range of microorganisms that produce epsilon-poly-L-lysine (M. Nishikawa and K. Ogawa, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:3575-3581, 2002). Using this method, we found an ergot fungus that secretes a charged polypeptide other than epsilon-poly-L-lysine. It was identified as a new species on the basis of its 28S rRNA sequence and was named Verticillium kibiense (formerly Epichloe kibiensis). Peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that the polypeptide is a linear peptide composed of repeated units of arginyl-histidine. The numbers of repeated units were in most cases five and in some cases four or six. This peptide showed activity against a broad range of bacteria and fungi but lost its activity under conditions of high ionic strength. Zinc and copper ions specifically changed the circular dichroism spectra of the peptide and restored the antimicrobial activity from abrogation under high ionic conditions, although these ions had no reinforcing effect on antimicrobial activity when they were added to solutions at a low ionic strength. The peptide labeled with fluorescein was able to permeate the cell membranes of target microbes, but its ability to permeate cell membranes decreased under conditions of high ionic strength. This decreased ability was partially recovered specifically by the addition of zinc and copper ions. These results indicate that poly(arginyl-histidine) is a cationic polypeptide characterized by specific metal binding and resistance to salts."
2010,20621590,Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses by piperine.,"Piperine, a main component of Piper longum Linn. and Piper nigrum Linn., is a plant alkaloid with a long history of medical use. Piperine exhibits anti-inflammatory activity; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We examined the effects of piperine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses. Administration of piperine inhibited LPS-induced endotoxin shock, leukocyte accumulation and the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but not of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. In peritoneal macrophages, piperine inhibited LPS/poly (I:C)/CpG-ODN-induced TNF-alpha production. Piperine also inhibited LPS-induced endotoxin shock in TNF-alpha knockout (KO) mice. To clarify the inhibitory mechanism of LPS-induced endotoxin shock, type 1 interferon (IFN) mRNA expression was determined. Piperine inhibited LPS-induced expression of type 1 IFN mRNA. Piperine inhibited the levels of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-7 mRNA, and the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3. Piperine also reduced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1. In addition, activation of STAT-1 was inhibited in IFN-alpha/beta-treated cells by piperine. These results suggest that piperine inhibits LPS-induced endotoxin shock through inhibition of type 1 IFN production."
2009,19681869,"Flavocoxid, a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, blunts pro-inflammatory phenotype activation in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages.","The flavonoids, baicalin and catechin, from Scutellaria baicalensis and Acacia catechu, respectively, have been used for various clinical applications. Flavocoxid is a mixed extract containing baicalin and catechin, and acts as a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. The anti-inflammatory activity, measured by protein and gene expression of inflammatory markers, of flavocoxid in rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated with Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated.LPS-stimulated (1 microg.mL(-1)) peritoneal rat macrophages were co-incubated with different concentrations of flavocoxid (32-128 microg.mL(-1)) or RPMI medium for different incubation times. Inducible COX-2, 5-LOX, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and inhibitory protein kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene and protein expression were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively. Finally, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels in macrophage supernatants were evaluated.LPS stimulation induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in rat peritoneal macrophages. Flavocoxid (128 microg.mL(-1)) significantly inhibited COX-2 (LPS = 18 +/- 2.1; flavocoxid = 3.8 +/- 0.9 integrated intensity), 5-LOX (LPS = 20 +/- 3.8; flavocoxid = 3.1 +/- 0.8 integrated intensity) and iNOS expression (LPS = 15 +/- 1.1; flavocoxid = 4.1 +/- 0.4 integrated intensity), but did not modify COX-1 expression. PGE(2) and LTB(4) levels in culture supernatants were consequently decreased. Flavocoxid also prevented the loss of IkappaB-alpha protein (LPS = 1.9 +/- 0.2; flavocoxid = 7.2 +/- 1.6 integrated intensity), blunted increased NF-kappaB binding activity (LPS = 9.2 +/- 2; flavocoxid = 2.4 +/- 0.7 integrated intensity) and the enhanced TNF-alpha mRNA levels (LPS = 8 +/- 0.9; flavocoxid = 1.9 +/- 0.8 n-fold/beta-actin) induced by LPS. Finally, flavocoxid decreased MDA, TNF and nitrite levels from LPS-stimulated macrophages.Flavocoxid might be useful as a potential anti-inflammatory agent, acting at the level of gene and protein expression."
1993,8434137,Influences of extracellular matrix components on the growth and differentiation of ruminal epithelial cells in primary culture.,"Primary cultures of ovine ruminal epithelial cells were made to study the influence of collagen types I and IV out of medium supplementation with various hormones and Na-n-butyrate on cell morphology and growth characteristics. Both collagen type I and type IV led to increased cell proliferation with the stimulatory effect being more pronounced in collagen IV. In cultures grown on collagen I, both non-stratified and stratified colonies were found, whereas cultures grown on collagen IV showed predominantly stratified growth. Cells in both stratified and non-stratified colonies were positive for cytokeratin antibody. In non-stratified colonies, positive staining with fibronectin antibodies (FN-15) was found in a network over and around the cells. It is suggested that the non-stratified ruminal epithelial cells are in some respects similar to a 'non-differentiating keratinocyte' strain, derived from newborn foreskin epidermis. Cells in stratified colonies bound Ulex europaeus (UEAI) lectin which has been shown to be specific for differentiated epithelial cells in ruminal mucosa. Supplementation of culture medium with glucagon and insulin increased the total cell-overgrown area of collagen I cultures, whereas this effect was absent in cultures grown on collagen IV. In both cultures grown on collagen I or IV, hydrocortisone led to an increase in total cell-overgrown area, whereas Na-n-butyrate inhibited proliferation."
2012,22486355,What predicts high risk acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at onset?: identification of those at highest risk by a novel acute GVHD risk score.,"To define high-risk acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at onset, we examined the initial GVHD stage and grade of 864 patients at the University of Minnesota who received uniform therapy with prednisone 60 mg/m(2) per d. We compared the prognostic utility of the Minnesota (MN; modified from Consensus) versus Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) GVHD organ stage-derived grading systems. As neither GVHD grading system optimally predicted outcomes, a novel acute GVHD risk score was devised by combining the MN and CIBMTR systems. Using multiple regression analysis, we could dichotomize patients into high risk (HR, n = 86) acute GVHD with initial grade IIIC, IIID or IVD who were less likely to respond to steroid therapy by day 28 [relative risk (RR), 0·3, P < 0·001] and had a higher risk for transplant-related mortality (RR, 2·0, P < 0·001) than patients with standard risk (SR, initial grade IA-IIIB, n = 778) GVHD. Using this novel acute GVHD Risk Score, HR GVHD is either skin stage 4, lower gastrointestinal (GI) stage 3+, liver stage 3+, or skin stage 3 and lower GI or liver stage 2+ GVHD. Patients with HR acute GVHD have a poor prognosis, require alternative initial therapy and should be the focus of novel therapeutic trials."
2012,22394605,Inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters by flavonoids.,"Members of the human SLC superfamily such as organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) are drug uptake transporters that are localised on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes mediating the uptake of drugs such as atorvastatin and metformin into hepatocytes. Ingredients of food such as flavonoids influence the effects of drugs, e.g. by inhibition of drug transporters. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the Ginkgo biloba flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin, and the grapefruit flavonoids naringenin, naringin, and rutin on the OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 transport activity. Transporter expressing HEK293 cell lines were used with [3H]sulfobromophthalein ([3H]BSP) as substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, [3H]atorvastatin as substrate for OATP1B1, and [3H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]MPP(+)) as substrate for OCT1. The G. biloba flavonoids showed a competitive inhibition of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP and the OATP1B1-mediated [3H]atorvastatin uptake. Quercetin was the most potent inhibitor of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP transport with K(i)-values of 8.8±0.8μM and 7.8±1.7μM, respectively. For the inhibition of the OATP1B1-mediated [3H]atorvastatin transport, apigenin was the most potent inhibitor with a K(i) value of 0.6±0.2μM. Among the grapefruit flavonoids, naringenin was the most potent inhibitor of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP transport with IC(50)-values of 81.6±1.1μM and 101.1±1.1μM, respectively. All investigated flavonoids showed no significant inhibition of the OCT1-mediated [3H]MPP(+) uptake. Taken together, these in vitro studies showed that the investigated flavonoids inhibit the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated drug transport, which could be a mechanism for food-drug interactions in humans."
2017,28049462,New herbal composition (OA-F2) protects cartilage degeneration in a rat model of collagenase induced osteoarthritis.,"Prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) is on rise on the global scale. At present there are no satisfactory pharmacological agents for treating OA. Our previous study showed that Sida cordifolia L. and Zingiber officinale Rosc. had protective effect on cartilage. Here, we describe the effect of OA-F2, a herbal formulation prepared using combination of these two plants in alleviating OA associated symptoms in a rat model of collagenase-induced OA.OA was induced by intra-articular injection of collagenase type II in wistar rats. Diclofenac (10 mg/kg) was used as a reference control. Rats (n = 6) were divided into 6 groups: Healthy control (HC), osteoarthritic control (OAC), diclofenac (DICLO), OA-F2L (135 mg/kg), OA-F2M (270 mg/kg) and OA-F2H (540 mg/kg). The effects of the 20 days treatment were monitored by parameters like knee diameter, paw volume, paw retraction; serum C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Radiography and histopathology of knee joint were also studied. Additionally, gene expression was studied from isolated synovium tissue proving anti-osteoarthritic potential of OA-F2.Oral administration of OA-F2 has significantly prevented knee swelling compared to OAC; OA-F2 and DICLO, significantly reduced paw volume compared to OAC. Paw latency was remarkably increased by OA-F2 compared to OAC. OA-F2L (-0.670, p < 0.001), M (-0.110, p < 0.05) and H (0.073) has markedly reduced levels of CRP compared to DICLO. OA-F2L (p < 0.05), M (p < 0.001) and H (p < 0.05) significantly reduced ALP levels, compared to DICLO. GAG release in the serum was also significantly lowered in OA-F2 treated group compared to DICLO. Radiological and histopathological observations showed cartilage protection by OA-F2. OA-F2 has upregulated SOD and GPx. Upregulated CAT expression was observed in OA-F2M and H. Considerable down-regulation of expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9 was observed in all the groups. Up-regulation of TIMP-1 was observed in rats treated with OA-F2L, H and DICLO.OA-F2 has shown therapeutic effects in rat model of collagenase induced OA by demonstrating cartilage protection through controlling MMPs and improving anti-oxidant levels in arthritic synovium and is a potent candidate for further drug development and treatment for OA."
2012,22382311,Recent advances in the study on resveratrol.,"Appropriate long-term drinking of red wine is associated with a reduced risk for lifestyle-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, making resveratrol, a constituent of grapes and various other plants, an attractive compound to be studied. Historically, resveratrol has been identified as a phytoalexin, antioxidant, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inducer, silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) activator, and more. Despite scepticism concerning the biological availability of resveratrol, a growing body of in vivo evidence indicates that resveratrol has protective effects in several stress and disease models. Here, we provide a review of the studies on resveratrol, especially with respect to COX, PPAR, and eNOS activities, and discuss its potential for promoting human health."
2013,23750500,Reduced-energy cranberry juice increases folic acid and adiponectin and reduces homocysteine and oxidative stress in patients with the metabolic syndrome.,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises pathological conditions that include insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, visceral adiposity and dyslipidaemia, which favour the development of CVD. Some reports have shown that cranberry ingestion reduces cardiovascular risk factors. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this fruit in subjects with the MetS. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of reduced-energy cranberry juice consumption on metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with the MetS, and to verify the effects of cranberry juice concomitantly on homocysteine and adiponectin levels in patients with the MetS. For this purpose, fifty-six individuals with the MetS were selected and divided into two groups: control group (n 36) and cranberry-treated group (n 20). After consuming reduced-energy cranberry juice (0·7 litres/d) containing 0·4mg folic acid for 60 d, the cranberry-treated group showed an increase in adiponectin (P=0·010) and folic acid (P=0·033) and a decrease in homocysteine (P<0·001) in relation to baseline values and also in comparison with the controls (P<0·05). There was no significant change in the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6. In relation to oxidative stress measurements, decreased (P<0·05) lipoperoxidation and protein oxidation levels assessed by advanced oxidation protein products were found in the cranberry-treated group when compared with the control group. In conclusion, the consumption of cranberry juice for 60 d was able to improve some cardiovascular risk factors. The present data reinforce the importance of the inverse association between homocysteine and adiponectin and the need for more specifically designed studies on MetS patients."
2003,14665725,Angiotensin-converting enzyme and metals in untreated essential hypertension.,"Hypertension is an important health problem throughout the world and a risk factor for many diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, has an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Zinc (Zn), a trace element with important biological functions, is located in the catalytic site of ACE. Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) also appear to be involved in hypertension pathogenesis. In this study, plasma ACE activities and Cat, Cai, Mg, Na, K, and plasma/erythrocyte Zn levels of 20 untreated patients with essential hypertension and 28 healthy individuals were evaluated. Plasma ACE activities (p<0.05) and erythrocyte Zn concentrations (p<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with essential hypertension than values of the control group. No significant difference was found between plasma Zn concentrations of the groups (p>0.05). Plasma Cat (p<0.001) and Mg levels (p<0.05) in essential hypertension were significantly lower than those of controls. Plasma Na, K, and Cai levels remained normal in essential hypertension. There are complex associations between metals and arterial pressure. Ca and Mg deficiencies seem to be associated with increased prevalence of hypertension. Increases in erythrocyte Zn may have a future potential use for diagnosis of hypertension."
2008,18997395,Preference for dried bonito broth in olfactory-blocked or taste nerve-sectioned mice in the two-bottle choice test.,"We investigated how gustatory and olfactory information contributes to the preference for dried bonito broth in mice. In the two-bottle preference test, intact mice consumed dried bonito broth in preference to water or an amino acid-nucleotide (AN) solution containing the same concentration of amino acids and nucleotides as that in dried bonito broth. It was observed that mice with transected bilateral chorda tympani (CT) nerves, those with transected bilateral glossopharyngeal (GL) nerves, and those that were intranasally administered with zinc sulfate preferred dried bonito broth to water. Zinc sulfate was used to produce a temporary loss of olfaction. In the two-bottle preference test with dried bonito broth and an AN solution, the preference for the former was reduced in mice with transected bilateral GL nerves and in those with an olfactory blockade, but not in mice with transected bilateral CT nerves. These results suggest that dried bonito broth was preferred over the AN solution, and that simultaneous inputs from olfaction and the GL nerve contributed to this preference."
2019,31449274,Fatty Acids in Some Cooking Oils as Agents of Hormonal Manipulation in a Rat Model of Benign Prostate Cancer.,"Anti-androgenic substances, mainly prostate 5α-reductase inhibitors, used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have been associated with side effects in man and animals. To reduce these side effects as well as suppress BPH development, the management of the condition has come to include dietary interventions. This study investigated the effect of some cooking oils on testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate in rats. Male Sprague-dawley rats were distributed into eighteen groups (n=6) as A-R. A negative control group was injected subcutaneously with soya oil; while prostatic hyperplasia was induced subcutaneously in groups B-R with 3mg/kg testosterone daily for 14days. Group B was the positive control (BPH group) while groups C-R were also administered orally 800mg/kg of coconut, castor, canola, cottonseed, pomegranate, blackseed, sheabutter, olive oil, codliver, sardine, palm, repeatedly heated palm (RHPO), vegetable, repeatedly-heated vegetable (RHVO), sesame, and groundnut oils respectively, daily, for 14 days. Blood sample was drawn via retro-orbital sinus for the estimation of serum testosterone(T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level and rats were thereafter euthanized to obtain the prostates for T and DHT determination as well as tissue weights. Data are mean ± SEM, compared by ANOVA. The oils significantly reduced the increase in prostate weight (PW) to body weight (BW) ratio induced by testosterone. Apart from the fact that all the oils reduced the PW:BW ratio, the blackseed, sheabutter, sardine, vegetable and groundnut oils suppressed the DHT level in the serum, while pomegranate, olive, RHPO reduced DHT level in the prostate compared to the BPH rats. This study suggests that blackseed, sheabutter, sardine, vegetable, groundnut, pomegranate, olive, and RHPO oils could inhibit testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate and therefore may be beneficial in the management of BPH."
2016,26988522,Synthesis and emulsifying properties of carbohydrate fatty acid esters produced from Agave tequilana fructans by enzymatic acylation.,"Carbohydrate fatty acid esters are non-ionic surfactants with a broad spectrum of applications. These molecules are generally synthesized using short carbohydrates or linear fructans; however in this research carbohydrate fatty acid esters were produced for the first time with branched fructans from Agave tequilana. Using immobilized lipases we successfully acylated A. tequilana fructans with vinyl laurate, obtaining products with different degrees of polymerization (DP). Lipozyme 435 was the most efficient lipase to catalyze the transesterification reaction. HPLC and ESI-MS analysis proved the presence of a mixture of acylated products as a result of the chemical complexity of fructans in the A. tequilana. The ESI-MS spectra showed a molecular mass shift between 183 and 366g/mol for fructooligosaccharides with a DP lower than 6, which indicated the presence of Agave fructans that had been mono- and diacylated with lauric acid. The carbohydrate fatty acid esters (CFAE) obtained showed good emulsifying properties in W/O emulsions."
2013,23811558,Ginsenoside Rh1 eliminates the cytoprotective phenotype of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-transduced human macrophages by inhibiting the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1.,"Red ginseng (the steamed root of Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER, Araliaceae), which contains ginsenosides as its main constituents, is frequently used to treat tumor, inflammation, diabetes, stress and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in Asian countries. Of these ginsenosides, only protopanaxadiol compound K has been reported to abolish the cytoprotective phenotype of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-transfected human macrophages. Here, we investigated the anti-cytoprotective effect of protopanaxatriol ginsenoside Rh1 on Tat-expressing cytoprotective CHME5 cells and D3-infected human primary macrophages. Treatment with ginsenoside Rh1 in the presence of lipopolysaccharide/cycloheximide (LPS/CHX) potently abolished the cytoprotective phenotype of Tat-transduced CHME5 cells as well as D3-infected human primary macrophages. Ginsenoside Rh1 significantly inhibited LPS/CHX-induced Akt phosphorylation, as well as mammalian target of rapamycin and Bcl-2-associated death promoter activation in both cell types. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rh1 inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1) phosphorylation. However, ginsenoside Rh1 did not inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase phosphorylation. Ginsenosides Rh1 in the presence of miltefosine (5 µM) additively increased the anti-cytoprotective activity against HIV-1 Tat-expressing macrophages. On the basis of these findings, we propose that ginsenoside Rh1 could possibly eliminate HIV-1 infected macrophages by inhibiting the PDK1/Akt pathway. "
2016,27234530,"In vivo and in vitro effectiveness of Azadirachta indica-synthesized silver nanocrystals against Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum, and their potential against malaria mosquitoes.","Malaria transmission is a serious emergence in urban and semiurban areas worldwide, becoming a major international public health concern. Malaria is transmitted through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. The extensive employ of synthetic pesticides leads to negative effects on human health and the environment. Recently, plant-synthesized nanoparticles have been proposed as highly effective mosquitocides. In this research, we synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the Azadirachta indica seed kernel extract as reducing and stabilizing agent. AgNP were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, SEM, EDX, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. The A. indica seed kernel extract was toxic against Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae, LC50 were 232.8ppm (larva I), 260.6ppm (II), 290.3ppm (III), 323.4ppm (IV), and 348.4ppm (pupa). AgNP LC50 were 3.9ppm (I), 4.9ppm (II), 5.6ppm (III), 6.5ppm (IV), and 8.2ppm (pupa). The antiplasmodial activity of A. indica seed kernel extract and AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of A. indica seed kernel extract were 63.18μg/ml (CQ-s) and 69.24μg/ml (CQ-r). A. indica seed kernel-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50, of 82.41μg/ml (CQ-s) and 86.12μg/ml (CQ-r). However, in vivo anti-plasmodial experiments conducted on Plasmodium berghei infecting albino mice showed moderate activity of the A. indica extract and AgNP. Overall, this study showed that the A. indica-mediated fabrication of AgNP is of interest for a wide array of purposes, ranging from IPM of mosquito vectors to the development of novel and cheap antimalarial drugs.

2014,25273130,A comparative analysis of characteristic floral scent compounds in Prunus mume and related species.,"In order to investigate the difference in their characteristic floral scents between Prunus mume Siebold & Zucc. and the related Prunus species, their headspace volatiles and endogenous extraction were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The efficiency of substrate utilization of the flowers was studied by incubating them with different alcohol substrates. Our results indicated that benzyl acetate is a dominant compound influencing the characteristic floral scent of P. mume. An alcohol substrate concentration of 4 mmol L(-1) and a reaction time of 2 h were constituted the reaction condition for catalysis of exogenous alcohol substrates by the flowers. Under these conditions, Prunus sibirica exhibited the highest utilization efficiency for benzyl alcohol substrate while the utilization efficiency of Prunus persica was the lowest. Comparative analysis of several alcohol substrates indicated that the flowers of the tested species had selective specificity for benzyl alcohol substrates."
2019,30888914,Osteoprotective Effects of Tribulus terrestris L.: Relationship Between Dehydroepiandrosterone Levels and Ca2+-Sparing Effect.,"Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease that is characterized by impairments in bone strength that predispose an individual to a higher risk of fractures. Despite the various etiologies, undoubtedly the most important factors are aging of the population and hypogonadism. Although several therapeutic options are available, pharmacological treatments have some risks. Among these are increases in the incidence of thrombosis, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and muscle injury, among others. Herbal medication may be an alternative for the treatment of osteoporosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a standardized extract of Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in rats. Female rats were first subjected to OVX and treated with TT (3, 30, and 300 mg/[kg·day]) or furosemide (25 mg/kg) orally for 28 days. Bone densitometry and tibial histology were performed, and acute renal function and testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estradiol levels were assessed. Prolonged treatment with TT stimulated bone mass gain in all ovariectomized animals, raising bone mass to levels that were similar to sham-operated rats. DHEA levels significantly increased in TT-treated rats. The TT group also had lower calcium (Ca2+) excretion that OVX control and furosemide-treated rats. Finally, the histopathological analyses showed the maintenance of bone turnover in all TT-treated groups. Overall, the results indicate that the standardized extract of T. terrestris exerted a bone-protective effect by increasing bone mineral density. This activity may be at least partially attributable to an increase in serum DHEA levels and a Ca2+-sparing effect."
2008,18405890,"Immune up regulatory response of a non-caloric natural sweetener, stevioside.","Immunomodulation is a process, which alters the immune system of an organism by interfering with its functions. This interference results in either immunostimulation or immunosuppression. An immunomodulator is any substance that helps to regulate the immune system. This ""regulation"" is a normalization process, so that an immunomodulator helps to optimise immune response. Immunomodulators are becoming very popular in the worldwide natural health industry as these do not tend to boost immunity, but to normalize it. Keeping this in view, major efforts have to be directed to modulate the immune responses, to permit effective treatment of various ailments associated with immune system and thus the development of a safe and effective immunomodulator for clinical us. Leaves of Stevia rebaudiana are a source of several sweet glycosides of steviol. The major glycoside, stevioside, diterpenoid glycoside--is used in oriental countries as a food sweetener. Its medical use is also reported as a heart tonic. Besides, it is used against obesity, hypertension, and stomach burn and to lower uric acid levels. Here in this study, stevioside was tested for its immunomodulatory activity on different parameters of the immune system at three different doses (6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg p.o.) on normal as well as cyclophosphamide treated mice. Stevioside was found effective in increasing phagocytic activity, haemagglutination antibody titre and delayed type hypersensitivity. In parallel, stevioside substantially increase proliferation in the LPS and Con A stimulated B and T cells, respectively. Present study, therefore, reveals that the drug holds promise as immunomodulating agent, which acts by stimulating both humoral as well as cellular immunity and phagocytic function."
2012,22791241,Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a serious complication of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the domains affected are well established, but new affected domains such as theory of mind are still being identified. The evidence that disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) improve and prevent the development of CI in MS is not solid. Recent studies on the prevalence of CI in MS among people treated with DMT, although not as solid as studies completed prior to DMT introduction, suggest that CI remains a problem even among people on DMTs and that CI occurs frequently even at the very earliest stages of MS. Functional MRI studies and studies using diffusion tractography show that the impact of lesions on cognition depends on the particular cortical networks affected and their plasticity. Cognitive rehabilitation and L-amphetamine appear promising symptomatic treatments for CI in MS, while, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have failed, and data on Ginkgo and exercise are limited. We need more work to understand better CI in MS and develop treatments for this serious complication of MS."
2019,31000046,Effect of sodium nitroprusside treatment on shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways of apple fruit.,"Blue mould caused by Penicillium expansum is one of the important diseases of apple fruit during storage. Phenylpropanoid pathway is an important induction mechanism that can utilize downstream metabolites of shikimate pathway to synthesize a series of secondary metabolites. Apple fruit (cv. Fuji) were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to study its effect on blue mould, shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. The results showed that 1.0 mmol L-1 SNP significantly inhibited lesion development of apple fruit inoculated with P. expansum. The results also indicated that SNP enhanced MdDHQS, MdSKDH, MdSK and MdEPSPS genes expressions, increased shikimic acid, tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine contents in apple fruit. The activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase, 4-coumarate: coenzyme A, ligase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, lignin, total phenolic compounds and flavonoids contents in apple fruit were also increased by SNP treatment. These results suggest that SNP might modulate shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways to enhance disease resistance of apple fruit."
,10967716,[Diuretic and hypotensive effects of Nigella sativa in the spontaneously hypertensive rat].,"Nigella sativa (ranunculaceae) is used in Arab folk medicine as a diuretic and hypotensive plant. We report here the diuretic and hypotensive effects of dichloromethane extract of Nigella sativa seeds in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). An oral dose of Nigella sativa extract (0.6 ml/kg/day) and furosemide (5 mg/kg/day) increased significantly the diuresis by 16 and 30 per cent respectively after 15 days of treatment; urinary excretion of Cl-, Na+, K+ and urea is also increased. Simultaneously, the mean arterial pressure decreased respectively by 22 and 18 per cent in the Nigella sativa treated rat and nifédipine treated rat (0.5 mg/kg/day). In conclusion, the diuretic activity observed in the SHR rat treated with Nigella sativa seeds may be partially responsible for its diuretic action; it seems that other pathways may also be involved in their cardiovascular effects."
1980,6774611,Factor II antigen in liver disease and warfarin-induced vitamin K deficiency: correlation with coagulant activity using Echis venom.,"Four coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X) are synthesized in the liver as precursor forms. Vitamin K is necessary for their conversion to functional factors. Factor II precursor is antigenically similar to factor II and can be activated to form thrombin by Echis carinatus venom. Forty-one patients with liver disease and 30 patients with vitamin K deficiency (Warfarin treated), were compared with 51 normal patients. Rats with CCl4-induced hepatic necrosis and animals given Warfarin were also studied. The following measurements were made: standard prothrombin time; Echis clotting time; factor II coagulant assay with thromboplastin; factor II assay with Echis venom; and factor II antigen (human) by electroimmunoassay. In animals and humans with liver disease, factor II was reduced, as measured by all techniques. With vitamin K deficiency functional factor II was reduced, but factor II antigen and Echis factor II activity were normal. THe data suggest that the prothrombin time and Echis coagulation methods can be used to differentiate whether the coagulopathy in liver disease is due to reduced precursor levels of factor II, vitamin K deficiency (ie, impaired formation of functional from precursor factor II), or both."
2004,14970734,Serum levels of sex hormones and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women: a case-control study (USA).,"High levels of serum estrogens and androgens have been convincingly linked with an increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women. By contrast, the role of blood levels of these hormones in the etiology of premenopausal breast cancer is not well understood. In a case-control study, we sought to examine associations between levels of serum estradiol, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, androstenedione and progesterone and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Cases of breast cancer under age 45 were identified using rapid ascertainment systems in Seattle/Puget Sound, Washington and control subjects were identified from the same area through random digit dialing methods. A total of 169 eligible breast cancer cases and 195 control subjects donated blood (either before or six or more weeks after surgery) and were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. The fully adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the highest versus lowest tertiles of estradiol, according to menstrual cycle phase, were 3.10 (0.8-12.7) for early follicular, 0.54 (0.2-1.7) for late follicular and 0.60 (0.3-1.4) for luteal. Risks for highest versus lowest quartiles of SHBG and androgens were 0.81 (0.4-1.6) for SHBG, 2.42 (1.1-5.2) for DHEA, 1.12 (0.6-2.5) for testosterone, and 1.33 (0.6-2.8) for androstenedione. For luteal progesterone, the RR for the highest versus lowest tertile was 0.55 (0.2-1.4). In summary, we did not find a convincing association between serum SHBG, estradiol, testosterone or androstenedione and premenopausal breast cancer risk. Observed differences between cases and controls subjects in serum levels of DHEA and luteal phase progesterone should be investigated further in large prospective studies."
2013,22580766,Chronic GVHD: Where are we? Where do we want to be? Will immunomodulatory drugs help?,"Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is an important problem after allotransplants. Some risk factors for cGVHD are similar to those of acute GVHD (aGVHD) but others are distinct indicating sometimes overlapping but unique pathogeneses. Precise incidence and prevalence data of cGVHD are lacking because of diverse diagnostic criteria but a 50% risk is a reasonable estimate. Incidence and prevalence of cGVHD are probably growing because of increased use of unrelated donors, blood rather than bone marrow (BM) grafts, decreased early transplant-related mortality (TRM) and increasing frequency of allotransplants. Pathophysiology of cGVHD is complex and poorly understood. Notably, no reliable surrogate end point to predict mechanism(s) of cGVHD has been identified. Therapy of cGVHD is unsatisfactory. Corticosteroids are effective but other drugs are controversial and few are rigorously tested in randomized trials. Highly variable response rates are reported because of small sample sizes and inconsistencies in eligibility, diagnostic and response criteria. We focus on the possible role of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), thalidomide lenalidomide and pomalidomide, in preventing and treating cGVHD. The data suggest activity of thalidomide but at doses not clinically practical in many instances. There are few data with lenalidomide. Trials of pomalidomide, which has immune activities like thalidomide but with fewer adverse effects, are beginning. Because cGVHD is not recently reviewed in Bone Marrow Transplantation, we give a brief background and discuss challenges in diagnosing, understanding and treating cGVHD including the recently proposed National Institutes of Health consensus criteria for cGVHD."
2012,22953827,Development and validation of the high performance liquid chromatography-ion exclusion method for detection of lactic acid in milk.,"The present work reports the development and validation of an analytical method for lactic acid quantification in milk by ion exclusion-HPLC with UV detection. This method showed good precision (variation coefficient <7.0%) and good accuracy (97.6-99.6%). Calibration curves were linear (R(2)>0.996) at the tested range of 5.0-25.0mmolL(-1); and the detection and quantification limits were 0.5 and 1.0mmolL(-1), respectively. Analysis of lactic acid in fermented milk (FM) or NaOH neutralised fermented milk (FNM) was performed using samples obtained during 9h of fermentation. An ANOVA analysis combined with the Tukey test was used to show that the method was insensitive to the differences between FM and FNM. The proposed method therefore proved to be a useful quality control tool in laboratories because it was able to determine milk acidity even in adulterated samples."
2018,28980138,Effect of Selenium on Ion Profiles and Antioxidant Defense in Mice Livers.,"Se entering the mammalian body from diverse sources shows different liver accumulation patterns. However, the effects of Se from diverse sources on the body's I on spectrum and the relationship between the changes in the ion spectrum and antioxidant function are not clear. In this study, 80 3-week-old female mice were randomly divided into four groups: a control group, sodium selenite group, yeast Se group, and seaweed Se group. The estimated Se contents were 0.03, 0.23, 0.23, and 0.23 mg/kg, respectively. The liver was collected from mice on day 60. The results showed that, compared with the control group, sodium selenite significantly reduced Na and Li contents and significantly increased Cr, Ni, Se, and Sb contents (P < 0.05); yeast Se significantly increased Mg, Ca, Si, Cr, Fe, Co, Cu, Se, Sb, and Al contents, and significantly reduced Tl, As, and Hg contents (P < 0.05); seaweed Se significantly increased B, Si, Cr, Fe, Se, As, and Hg contents, and significantly reduced Zn and Tl contents (P < 0.05). The results of antioxidant parameter analysis showed that Se from three sources increased total superoxide dismutase content and significantly reduced malondialdehyde content (P < 0.05), whereas no clear effect was observed on total antioxidant capacity (P > 0.05). Combined with the ion spectrum and antioxidant test results, yeast Se was found to most effectively promote the accumulation of beneficial elements, enhance antioxidant capacity, and reduce the concentration of toxic elements. The variety of ion spectrum antioxidants followed a similar trend, which indicated that the ion spectrum might be related to antioxidant activity."
2012,22640402,The anticancer effect of saffron in two p53 isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines.,"Saffron extract, a natural product, has been shown to induce apoptosis in several tumor cell lines. Nevertheless, the p53-dependency of saffron's mechanism of action in colon cancer remains unexplored.In order to examine saffron's anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in colorectal cancer cells, we treated two p53 isogenic HCT116 cell lines (HCT wildtype and HCT p53-/-) with different doses of the drug and analyzed cell proliferation and apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. MTT viability and crystal violet assays were performed in order to determine the effective dose of saffron on both cell lines. The cell cycle progress was examined by Flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin-PI-staining and Western Blotting for caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. Autophagy was determined by Western Blotting of the light chain 3 (LC3)-II and Beclin 1 proteins. The protein content of phospho-H2AX (γH2AX), a sensor of DNA double strand breaks, was also analyzed by Western Blotting.Saffron extract induced a p53-dependent pattern of cell cycle distribution with a full G2/M stop in HCT116 p53 wildtype cells. However, it induced a remarkable delay in S/G2 phase transit with entry into mitosis in HCT116 p53 -/- cells. The apoptotic Pre-G1 cell fraction as well as Annexin V staining and caspase 3 cleavage showed a more pronounced apoptosis induction in HCT116 p53 wildtype cells. Obviously, the significantly higher DNA-damage, reflected by ɣH2AX protein levels in cells lacking p53, was coped by up-regulation of autophagy. The saffron-induced LC3-II protein level was a remarkable indication of the accumulation of autophagosomes, a response to the cellular stress condition of drug treatment.This is the first study showing the effect of saffron in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with different p53 status. Saffron induced DNA-damage and apoptosis in both cell lines. However, autophagy has delayed the induction of apoptosis in HCT116 p53 -/- cells. Considering the fact that most tumors show a functional p53 inactivation, further research is needed to elucidate the long-term effects of saffron in p53 -/- tumors."
1995,8533970,In vitro modulation of bovine blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells by oxytetracycline.,"The effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) on bovine blood mononuclear cells and neutrophil functions was examined in vitro. Neutrophil functions tested include respiratory burst, peroxidase, and antibacterial activities. Neutrophils were treated with OTC (10 to 1,500 micrograms/ml) before exposure to either opsonized zymosan or bacteria. A dose-response inhibition of antibacterial activity to high concentrations of OTC (500 to 1,000 micrograms/ml) was observed. Beginning at a concentration of 15 micrograms/ml, OTC treatment of neutrophil lysates resulted in decreased peroxidase activity. A dose response was not observed. In contrast, respiratory burst, measured by nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, increased after OTC exposure, but only at high concentrations (500 and 1,000 micrograms/ml) of OTC. Mitogen-induced proliferation of blood mononuclear cells cocultured with OTC and concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin-P, or pokeweed mitogen was inhibited at an OTC concentration of 100 micrograms/ml at 48 and 72 hours of culture. These results indicate that blood mononuclear cells are more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of OTC than are neutrophils. Furthermore, the OTC-mediated inhibition of neutrophil antimicrobial activity is inversely related to the increase in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. This suggests that OTC is uncoupling the hexose monophosphate shunt from production of secreted oxygen radicals. These results also suggest that the peroxidase enzyme system has a large biological reserve capacity."
2011,21854562,Effect of a Herbal-Leucine mix on the IL-1β-induced cartilage degradation and inflammatory gene expression in human chondrocytes.,"Conventional treatments for the articular diseases are often effective for symptom relief, but can also cause significant side effects and do not slow the progression of the disease. Several natural substances have been shown to be effective at relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA), and preliminary evidence suggests that some of these compounds may exert a favorable influence on the course of the disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory/chondroprotective potential of a Herbal and amino acid mixture containing extract of the Uncaria tomentosa, Boswellia spp., Lepidium meyenii and L-Leucine on the IL-1β-induced production of nitric oxide (NO), glycosaminoglycan (GAG), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), aggrecan (ACAN) and type II collagen (COL2A1) in human OA chondrocytes and OA cartilage explants.Primary OA chondrocytes or OA cartilage explants were pretreated with Herbal-Leucine mixture (HLM, 1-10 μg/ml) and then stimulated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml). Effect of HLM on IL-1β-induced gene expression of iNOS, MMP-9, MMP-13, ACAN and COL2A1 was verified by real time-PCR. Estimation of NO and GAG release in culture supernatant was done using commercially available kits.HLM tested in these in vitro studies was found to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, as evidenced by strong inhibition of iNOS, MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression and NO production in IL-1β-stimulated OA chondrocytes (p < 0.05). Supporting these gene expression results, IL-1β-induced cartilage matrix breakdown, as evidenced by GAG release from cartilage explants, was also significantly blocked (p < 0.05). Moreover, in the presence of herbal-Leucine mixture (HLM) up-regulation of ACAN and COL2A1 expression in IL-1β-stimulated OA chondrocytes was also noted (p < 0.05). The inhibitory effects of HLM were mediated by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB in human OA chondrocytes in presence of IL-1β.Our data suggests that HLM could be chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent in arthritis, switching chondrocyte gene expression from catabolic direction towards anabolic and regenerative, and consequently this approach may be potentially useful as a new adjunct therapeutic/preventive agent for OA or injury recovery."
2012,22141426,Effect of sibutramine on 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels and selected oxidative biomarkers on brain regions of female rats in the presence of zinc.,"A number of drugs, like sibutramine, which are used clinically in weight control, act on serotonergic metabolism. However, their relation with zinc and free radical (FR) production in central nervous system remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sibutramine and zinc on FR production. Female Wistar rats (about 250 g) were used in this study. The animals received 400 μg/kg of zinc and 10 mg/kg of sibutramine intraperitoneally every 36 hr for 15 days. At the end of the study, the rats were killed and their brains used for the measurement of lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ), calcium and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, all by means of validated methods. Corporal weight and food consumption were found to be decreased in the zinc/sibutramine group. TBARS decreased in cortex, hemispheres and medulla oblongata. GSH decreased in cortex, hemispheres and cerebellum in the sibutramine group. Zinc given alone and in combination with sibutramine decreased H(2) O(2)  concentration in cortex, hemispheres and cerebellum but increased calcium and 5-HIAA concentration in all brain regions. Our results suggest that sibutramine and zinc are associated with weight loss, an effect that was more pronounced in the group treated with both drugs. Reduction in oxidative stress may be involved in these effects."
2019,31573167,Anticoagulation: Updated Guidelines for Outpatient Management.,"Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for preventing, treating, and reducing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and preventing stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line agents for eligible patients for treating venous thromboembolism and preventing stroke in those with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists are recommended for patients with mechanical valves and valvular atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists inhibit the production of vitamin K-related factors and require a minimum of five days overlap with parenteral anticoagulants, whereas direct oral anticoagulants directly inhibit factor II or factor Xa, providing more immediate anticoagulation. The immediate effect of direct oral anticoagulants permits select patients at low risk to initiate treatment in the outpatient setting for venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin continues to be recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with venous thromboembolism and active cancer, although there is growing evidence of effectiveness for the use of direct oral anticoagulants in this patient population. Validated bleeding risk assessments such as HAS-BLED should be performed at each visit and modifiable factors should be addressed. Major bleeding should be treated with vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for patients already being treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Idarucizumab has been effective for reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, and andexanet alfa has been effective for reversing the effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban."
2018,29421519,Improvement of antihyperglycemic activity of nano-thymoquinone in rat model of type-2 diabetes.,"Thymoquinone is a bioactive constituent of Nigella sativa seeds. It has been reported to possess antihyperglycemic effect in rats. However, the effect of nanoformulation (NF) of thymoquinone has not been reported in literature. So, the present study was designed with the aim to investigate the effect of nanoformulation of thymoquinone in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type-2 diabetic rats and compare its effect with pure bioactive compound as well as metformin, a standard antidiabetic drug. It is the first study reporting the use of thymoquinone NF against diabetes. Polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) of thymoquinone and metformin were prepared by nanoprecipitation method using gum rosin, a biocompatible polymer. Box-Behnken statistical analysis tool was used for the optimization of polymer and other excipients. The NCs were then characterized with respect to particle size, stability, morphology, and in vitro drug dissolution profiles. Furthermore, thymoquinone (20, 40 & 80 mg/kg), metformin (150 mg/kg) and their nanoformulations (20, 40 & 80 mg/kg for thymoquinone and 80 mg/kg for metformin) per se were administered for 21 successive days to type-2 diabetic rats. Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured every week for 3 weeks. Serum lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin were estimated on 22nd day. The nanocapsules were stable, spherical in shape and size was less than 100 nm. Thymoquinone-and metformin-loaded NCs showed sustained release profile as compared to their pure forms. Oral administration of thymoquinone, metformin and their nanoformulations significantly decreased blood glucose level and glycated haemoglobin; and improved the lipid profile of diabetic rats as compared to diabetic control rats. Thymoquinone-loaded NCs (containing 10, 20 and 40 mg of thymoquinone) produced dose-dependent antihyperglycemic effect and this effect was comparable to thymoquinone and metformin. In conclusion, thymoquinone nanocapsules (actually containing half of the doses of thymoquinone) produced better antihyperglycemic effect in type-2 diabetic rats as compared to thymoquinone alone."
2007,17888406,"Effects of resveratrol, a grape polyphenol, on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.","We report the effects of resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the skins of red grapes, on catecholamine secretion and synthesis in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Resveratrol suppressed catecholamine secretion and (22)Na(+) and (45)Ca(2+) influx induced by acetylcholine, an agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=20.4, 11.0, and 62.8 microM, respectively). Resveratrol also inhibited catecholamine secretion induced by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, and 56 mM K(+), an activator of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, at concentrations similar to those for (45)Ca(2+) influx. Resveratrol directly inhibited the current evoked by acetylcholine in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (IC(50)=25.9 microM). Furthermore, resveratrol (IC(50)=5.32 microM) attenuated (14)C-catecholamine synthesis induced by acetylcholine. The present findings suggest that resveratrol inhibits acetylcholine-induced catecholamine secretion and synthesis through suppressing ion influx in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells."
2019,31034797,Activation of G protein-coupled receptor 30 by flavonoids leads to expression of acetylcholinesterase in cultured PC12 cells.,"Flavonoids, considered as phytoestrogen mainly deriving from fruit and vegetable, are known to have beneficial effects in brain functions. The role of flavonoids in induction of a cholinergic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), was being explored here. In cultured PC12 cells, twenty-four commonly found flavonoids were tested for its induction on AChE activity. Fourteen flavonoids showed induction, and five of them had robust effect, i.e. daidzin, alpinetin, irisflorentin, cardamonin and lysionotin. The induction of AChE was fully blocked by pre-treatment of G15 (a selective G protein-coupled receptor 30 [GPR 30] antagonist), suggesting a direct involvement of a membrane-bound estrogen receptor, named as GPR 30, in the cultures. In addition, daidzin was further identified to induce expression of tetrameric globular form of proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA)-linked AChE. In parallel, application of daidzin in cultured PC12 cells significantly induced expression of neurofilaments, markers for neuronal differentiation. Taken together, flavonoids could induce the expression of AChE via GPR 30 in cultured PC12 cells, which could be a good candidate for possible treatment of the brain diseases."
2016,26642334,Prognostic impact of progression to induction chemotherapy and prior paclitaxel therapy in patients with germ cell tumors receiving salvage high-dose chemotherapy in the last 10 years: a study of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Solid Tumors Working Party.,"Little is known about the prognostic impact of prior paclitaxel therapy and response to induction chemotherapy defined as the regimen preceding high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) for the salvage therapy of advanced germ cell tumors. Twenty European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers contributed data on patients treated between 2002 and 2012. Paclitaxel used in either prior lines of therapy or in induction-mobilization regimens was considered. Multivariable Cox analyses of prespecified factors were undertaken on PFS and overall survival (OS). As of October 2013, data for 324 patients had been contributed to this study. One hundred and ninety-two patients (59.3%) had received paclitaxel. Sixty-one patients (19%) had a progression to induction chemotherapy, 234 (72%) a response (29 (9%) missing or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor without chemotherapy). Both progression to induction chemotherapy and prior paclitaxel were significantly associated with shorter OS univariably (P<0.001 and P=0.032). On multivariable analysis from the model with fully available data (N=216) progression to induction was significantly prognostic for PFS and OS (P=0.003), but prior paclitaxel was not (P=0.674 and P=0.739). These results were confirmed after multiple imputation of missing data. Progression to induction chemotherapy could be demonstrated as an independent prognostic factor, in contrast to prior paclitaxel. "
2019,31369988,Roman chamomile inhalation combined with clomipramine treatment improves treatment-resistant depression-like behavior in mice.,"It is well known that chamomile is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and has been used to treat various disorders, but it is mainly German chamomile. The effects of Roman chamomile on depression still unclear. In this study, we used chronically stressed mice to investigate whether inhalation of Roman chamomile essential oil affects depression-like behavior. We previously reported that restraint and water immersion stress produce depression-like behavior and a blunted response to the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. Each mouse was exposed to restraint and water immersion stress for 15 days, and resistance to the effect of clomipramine was induced in a behavioral despair paradigm. In the present study, we found that cotreatment with clomipramine and inhalation of Roman chamomile attenuated depression-like behavior in a forced swim test. Next, we examined the hippocampal mRNA levels of two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6); a neurotrophic factor, brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and nerve growth factor (NGF). TNF alpha, IL-6 and BDNF mRNA levels did not change in the hippocampus of stressed mice. However, the NGF mRNA level was significantly decreased, and this decrease was not attenuated by treatment with clomipramine or inhalation of Roman chamomile alone. We also examined whether Roman chamomile combined with clomipramine treatment affects hippocampal neurogenesis and serum corticosterone levels. Stressed mice had fewer doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, but this was significantly attenuated by Roman chamomile and clomipramine treatment. In addition, the serum corticosterone level was also significantly decreased by treatment with Roman chamomile and clomipramine. These results suggest that Roman chamomile inhalation may enhance the antidepressant effect of clomipramine by increasing hippocampal neurogenesis and modulating corticosterone levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression."
2014,25036131,"Antioxidative activity, moisture retention, film formation, and viscosity stability of Auricularia fuscosuccinea, white strain water extract.","This study showed that both water extracts (WAF-W) and ethanol extracts (EAF-W) of Auricularia fuscosuccinea (Montagne) Farlow, white strain (AF-W) demonstrated significantly stronger antioxidative effects than did commercially available Tremella fuciformis sporocarp extracts (WSK; with the exception of EAF-W in terms of superoxide radical scavenging activity levels). The moisture retention capacity of WAF-W is as potent as that of sodium hyaluronate (SHA), but less than that of WSK. No corrugation or fissures were observed in WAF-W film; only the SHA and WSK films demonstrated such effects in low-moisture conditions. The WAF-W solution also exhibited stable viscosity at high temperatures, indicating that the WAF-W film was more stable compared with the SHA and WSK films. WAF-W induced no adverse effects when a hen's egg test was performed on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). This study demonstrated that WAF-W exhibits excellent potential as a topical material for skin moisturizing and anti-aging effects. "
2018,29193285,"Bioaccumulation, uptake, and toxicity of carbamazepine in soil-plant systems.","Since the detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in various environmental media, research has explored the potential uptake and toxicity of these chemicals to species inhabiting these matrices. Specifically, pharmaceuticals, including the antiepileptic API carbamazepine (CBZ), are taken up from soil by a range of plants. Many short-term studies have also suggested that certain APIs induce toxicity in plants. However, the effects of APIs on fruiting plants remain relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the uptake, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of CBZ in Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) from seed to full maturity across a range of CBZ exposure concentrations in soil (0.1-20 mg/kg). Results of biomass, chlorophyll, starch and total nitrogen (N) concentration in C. pepo indicated toxicity at soil concentrations of ≥10 mg/kg. There were clear visual indications of increasing toxicity on leaves, including chlorosis and necrosis, from soil concentrations of 1 up to 20 mg/kg. The present study also revealed novel insights into the effect of CBZ accumulation on C. pepo fruiting: female C. pepo flowers were unable to set fruit when leaf concentrations were ≥14 mg/kg. These findings may have implications for future agricultural productivity in areas where reclaimed wastewater containing APIs is a source of irrigation. Detectable CBZ concentrations were found in edible C. pepo fruit, indicating the possibility of trophic transfer. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1122-1130. © 2017 SETAC."
2013,23371804,"Evaluation of DA-9801, a new herbal drug for diabetic neuropathy, on metabolism-mediated interaction.","DA-9801, the mixture extract of Dioscoreae rhizoma and Dioscorea nipponica Makino, is a new herbal drug currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Korea. The inhibitory potentials of DA-9801, D. rhizoma extract, D. nipponica Makino extract, and dioscin, an active component of DA-9801, on eight human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and four UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes were investigated in human liver microsomes using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. DA-9801 showed slight inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9 enzyme activities with IC(50) values of 396.4, 449.9, 226.0, and 408.8 μg/mL, respectively. D. rhizoma extract showed negligible inhibition of CYP and UGT activities, but D. nipponica extract slightly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9 activities with IC(50) values of 264.2, 237.1, 206.8, 302.4, and 383.1 μg/mL, respectively. DA-9801 showed volume per dose index values of 0.44-0.88 L for a 200-mg dose, suggesting that they may not cause the inhibition of the metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9-catalyzed drugs in humans. These results suggest that the administration of DA-9801 in human may not cause clinically relevant inhibition of these enzymes."
2016,27809818,Essential oils from two Allium species exert effects on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the mouse dentate gyrus by modulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor and acetylcholinesterase.,"In the present study, we investigated the effects of oil products from two Allium species: Allium sativum (garlic) and Allium hookeri (Chinese chives) on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the mouse dentate gyrus.Using corn oil as a vehicle, the essential oil from garlic (10 ml/kg), or Chinese chives (10 ml/kg) was administered orally to 9-week-old mice once a day for 3 weeks. One hour following the last treatment, a novel object recognition test was conducted and the animals were killed 2 h after the test.In comparison to the vehicle-treated group, garlic essential oil (GO) treatment resulted in significantly increased exploration time and discrimination index during the novel object recognition test, while Chinese chives essential oil (CO) reduced the exploration time and discrimination index in the same test. In addition, the number of Ki67-immunoreactive proliferating cells and doublecortin-immunoreactive neuroblasts significantly increased in the dentate gyrus of GO-treated animals. However, administration of CO significantly decreased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation. Administration of GO significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampal homogenates. In contrast, administration of CO decreased BDNF protein levels and had no significant effect on AChE activity, compared to that in the vehicle-treated group.These results suggest that GO significantly improves novel object recognition as well as increases cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, by modulating hippocampal BDNF protein levels and AChE activity, while CO impairs novel object recognition and decreases cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, by reducing BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus."
2011,21736852,Proline betaine and its biotransformation products in fasting urine samples are potential biomarkers of habitual citrus fruit consumption.,"The lack of robust measures of dietary exposure hinders a quantitative understanding of causal relationships between diet and health. Non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting was used to explore the relationships between citrus exposure in free-living human subjects, estimated by a FFQ, and the chemical content of urine. Volunteers (study 1, n 12; study 2, n 11) were classified into high-, medium- and low-frequency citrus consumption groups. Overnight and spot fasting urine samples were obtained after exposure to a standardised citrus-free evening meal. The urine samples were analysed by flow injection electrospray-ionisation MS followed by supervised multivariate data classification analysis to discover discriminatory features associated with the level of citrus exposure. Good separation of high and low citrus consumption classes was achieved. Deeper exploration of high-ranked explanatory mass signals revealed several correlated signals derived from proline betaine. Targeted analysis of the relative levels of proline betaine in both fasting and overnight urine samples demonstrated good correlation with FFQ exposure data. Acute exposure of volunteers to orange juice resulted in the appearance of proline betaine and several biotransformed products in postprandial urine samples. Biomarker validation showed sensitivities of 80·8-92·2 % and specificities of 74·2-94·1 % (false discovery rate-adjusted P values < 0·05) for elevated proline betaine in participants who reported high citrus consumption. Proline betaine biotransformation products displayed weaker quantitative relationships with habitual citrus exposure. Targeted screening for the presence of biotransformation products of hesperidin and narirutin, known to be abundant in oranges, revealed that they were relatively poor indicators of citrus exposure."
1996,8615394,Dehydroepiandrosterone reduces plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and tissue plasminogen activator antigen in men.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may help prevent heart disease in men. To test the hypothesis that DHEA might exert its effects by enhancing endogenous fibrinolytic potential, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted that assessed the effects of DHEA administration on plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen. Eighteen men received 50 mg DHEA orally and 16 men received a placebo capsule thrice daily for 12 days. Serum DHEA-sulfate and plasma PAI-1 and tPA antigen were measured before and after treatment. In the DHEA group, serum DHEA-sulfate (from 7.5 +/- 1.2 micromol/L to 20.2 +/- 1.5 micromol/L (P < 0.0001), androstenedione (from 2.6 +/- 0.2 nmol/L to 4.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/L; P < 0.005) and estrone (from 172 +/- 21 pmol/L to 352 +/- 28 pmol/L; P < 0.005) increased, whereas plasma PAI-1 (from 55.4 +/- 3.8 ng/mL to 38.6 +/- 3.3 ng/mL; P < 0.0001) and tPA antigen (from 8.1 +/- 1.9 ng/mL to 5.4 +/- 1.3 ng/mL; P < 0.0005) decreased. In the placebo group, serum DHEA-sulfate declined slightly from 8.0 +/- 3.3 micromol/L to 7.3 +/- 3.4 micromol/L (P < 0.05), but no other measured steroid changed. Plasma PAI-1 and tPA antigen did not change in the placebo group. These findings suggest that DHEA administration reduces plasma PAI-1 and tPA antigen concentrations in men."
2012,22705646,The vascular targeting agent Combretastatin-A4 directly induces autophagy in adenocarcinoma-derived colon cancer cells.,"Recent clinical data demonstrated that the vascular targeting agent Combretastatin-A4 phosphate (CA-4P) prolonged survival of patients with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer without any adverse side effects. However, as a single agent CA-4 failed to reduce tumour growth in the murine CT-26 adenocarcinoma colon cancer model. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of the innate resistance of HT-29 human adenocarcinoma cells to CA-4 is largely unknown. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that prolonged exposure to CA-4 and an azetidinone cis-restricted analogue, CA-432 (chemical name; 4-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-phenyl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-azetidin-2-one) induced autophagy in adenocarcinoma-derived CT-26, Caco-2 and HT-29 cells but not in fibrosarcoma-derived HT-1080 cells. Autophagy is a fundamental self-catabolic process which can facilitate a prolonged cell survival in spite of adverse stress by generating energy via lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic constituents. Autophagy was confirmed by acridine orange staining of vesicle formation, electron microscopy and increased expression of LC3-II. Combretastatin-induced autophagy was associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and elongation of the mitochondria. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by the vacuolar H(+)ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin-A1 (BAF-A1) significantly enhanced CA-432 induced HT-29 cell death. Both CA-4 and its synthetic derivative, CA-432 induced the formation of large hyperdiploid cells in Caco-2 and CT-26 cells. The formation of these polyploid cells was significantly inhibited by autophagy inhibitor, BAF-A1. Results presented within demonstrate that autophagy is a novel response to combretastatin exposure and may be manipulated to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of this class of vascular targeting agents."
2008,18239286,Protective Effects of macelignan on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity is associated with JNK activation.,"Cisplatin is one of the most effective antineoplastic drugs, but it has undesirable side effects such as hepatotoxicity at high doses. This study investigated the protective effect of macelignan, isolated from Myristica fragrans HOUTT. (nutmeg), against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity and the possible mechanisms involved in these effects in mice. Pretreatment with macelignan for 4 d significantly prevented the increased serum enzymatic activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase in a dose-dependent manner. The results also showed that the protective effects of macelignan on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity may be associated with the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase1/2 (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) was abrogated by pretreatment with macelignan, however, that of p38 was not significantly affected. It was also found that macelignan attenuated the expression of phosphorylated c-Jun in cisplatin-treated mice. Accordingly, it is suggested that the hepatoprotective effects of macelignan could be related to activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, especially JNK and c-Jun, its substrate. The present findings suggest that co-treatment of cisplatin with macelignan may provide more advantage than cisplatin treatment alone in cancer therapy."
2018,29571495,"Impact of roasting on the flavan-3-ol composition, sensory-related chemistry, and in vitro pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of cocoa beans.","Roasting is an important cocoa processing step, but has been reported to reduce the polyphenol content in the beans. We investigated the impact of whole-bean roasting on the polyphenol content, aroma-related chemistry, and in vitro pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory activity of cocoa under a range of roasting conditions. Total phenolics, (-)-epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin (PAC) dimer - pentamer content was reduced by roasting. By contrast, roasting at 150 °C or greater increased the levels of catechin and PAC hexamers and heptamers. These compounds have greater PL inhibitory potency. Consistent with these changes in PAC composition and this previous data, we found that roasting at 170 °C time-dependently increased PL inhibitory activity. Cocoa aroma-related compounds increased with roasting above 100 °C, whereas deleterious sensory-related compounds formed at more severe temperatures. Our results indicate that cocoa roasting can be optimized to increase the content of larger PACs and anti-PL activity, while maintaining a favorable aroma profile."
2006,16317106,Blood pressure and heart rate effects following a single dose of bitter orange.,"The ingredients of numerous ""ephedra-free"" dietary supplements used for weight loss include bitter orange, which contains sympathomimetic alkaloids such as synephrine. Due to the similarity in chemical structure to ephedrine and the potential sympathomimetic effects of synephrine, it is hypothesized that bitter orange may increase blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).To determine the effects on BP and HR after a single dose of bitter orange in healthy adults.In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 15 young, healthy, adult subjects received either a single dose of Nature's Way Bitter Orange--a 900 mg dietary supplement extract standardized to 6% synephrine--or matching placebo, with a one week washout period. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR were measured at baseline and every hour for 6 hours after administration.SBP after bitter orange was significantly increased versus placebo at hours 1-5 (p < 0.0001); the peak difference was 7.3 +/- 4.6 mm Hg. Although the baseline DBP was higher than after administration of both placebo and bitter orange, DBP after bitter orange was significantly increased versus placebo at hours 4 and 5 (p < or = 0.02); the peak difference was 2.6 +/- 3.8 mm Hg. HR was significantly increased after bitter orange versus placebo for hours 2-5 (p < 0.01); the peak difference was 4.2 +/- 4.5 beats/min.SBP, DBP, and HR were higher for up to 5 hours after a single dose of bitter orange versus placebo in young, healthy adults."
2009,19675304,"Vitamin K promotes mineralization, osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition, and an anticatabolic phenotype by {gamma}-carboxylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms.","The vitamin K family members phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and the menaquinones (vitamin K2) are under study for their roles in bone metabolism and as potential therapeutic agents for skeletal diseases. We have investigated the effects of two naturally occurring homologs, phytonadione (vitamin K1) and menatetrenone (vitamin K2), and those of the synthetic vitamin K, menadione (vitamin K3), on human primary osteoblasts. All homologs promoted in vitro mineralization by these cells. Vitamin K1-induced mineralization was highly sensitive to warfarin, whereas that induced by vitamins K2 and K3 was less sensitive, implying that gamma-carboxylation and other mechanisms, possibly genomic actions through activation of the steroid xenobiotic receptor, are involved in the effect. The positive effect on mineralization was associated with decreased matrix synthesis, evidenced by a decrease from control in expression of type I collagen mRNA, implying a maturational effect. Incubation in the presence of vitamin K2 or K3 in a three-dimensional type I collagen gel culture system resulted in increased numbers of cells with elongated cytoplasmic processes resembling osteocytes. This effect was not warfarin sensitive. Addition of calcein to vitamin K-treated cells revealed vitamin K-dependent deposition of mineral associated with cell processes. These effects are consistent with vitamin K promoting the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition in humans. To test whether vitamin K may also act on mature osteocytes, we tested the effects of vitamin K on MLO-Y4 cells. Vitamin K reduced receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand expression relative to osteoprotegerin by MLO-Y4 cells, an effect also seen in human cultures. Together, our findings suggest that vitamin K promotes the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition, at the same time decreasing the osteoclastogenic potential of these cells. These may be mechanisms by which vitamin K optimizes bone formation and integrity in vivo and may help explain the net positive effect of vitamin K on bone formation."
2017,28965514,"Parental nutritional programming and a reminder during juvenile stage affect growth, lipid metabolism and utilisation in later developmental stages of a marine teleost, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).","Nutrition during periconception and early development can modulate metabolic routes to prepare the offspring for adverse conditions through a process known as nutritional programming. In gilthead sea bream, replacement of fish oil (FO) with linseed oil (LO) in broodstock diets improves growth in the 4-month-old offspring challenged with low-FO and low-fishmeal (FM) diets for 1 month. The present study further investigated the effects of broodstock feeding on the same offspring when they were 16 months old and were challenged for a second time with the low-FM and low-FO diet for 2 months. The results showed that replacement of parental moderate-FO feeding with LO, combined with juvenile feeding at 4 months old with low-FM and low-FO diets, significantly (P<0·05) improved offspring growth and feed utilisation of low-FM/FO diets even when they were 16 months old: that is, when they were on the verge of their first reproductive season. Liver fatty acid composition was significantly affected by broodstock or reminder diets as well as by their interaction. Moreover, the reduction of long-chain PUFA and increase in α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in broodstock diets lead to a significant down-regulation of hepatic lipoprotein lipase (P<0·001) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 6 (P<0·01). Besides, fatty acid desaturase 2 values were positively correlated to hepatic levels of 18 : 4n-3, 18 : 3n-6, 20 : 5n-3, 22 : 6n-3 and 22 : 5n-6. Thus, this study demonstrated the long-term nutritional programming of gilthead sea bream through broodstock feeding, the effect of feeding a 'reminder' diet during juvenile stages to improve utilisation of low-FM/FO diets and fish growth as well as the regulation of gene expression along the fish's life-cycle."
2011,21415532,Curcumin attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced renal inflammation.,"Renal inflammation is the main pathological change in many acute and chronic kidney diseases. Curcumin, a yellow pigment present in the rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa L. Zingiberaceae), was found to be a potential anti-inflammatory agent. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of curcumin on the inflammation of mice kidney and cultured renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to explore the mechanism. Curcumin was injected intraperitoneally before LPS administration. Renal inflammation was assessed by evaluating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and macrophage infiltration in renal tissue using immunohistochemical methods, and also by measuring renal MCP-1 mRNA level using Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HK-2 cells were cultured to investigate the in vitro effect of curcumin against LPS-induced renal inflammation. The expression of MCP-1 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNA was measured by Real-Time PCR. The expression of MCP-1 and IL-8 protein in supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results demonstrated that curcumin could inhibit LPS-induced renal MCP-1 mRNA expression. Curcumin also significantly inhibited the expression of MCP-1 and IL-2 mRNA in HK-2 cells, and partially inhibited the secretion of MCP-1 and IL-8. Furthermore, curcumin was found to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. The present study demonstrated that curcumin has a protective effect on LPS-induced experimental renal inflammation, and this effect might be attributed to its inhibitory effects on MCP-1 mRNA expression and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Hence, curcumin might be potentially useful in some kidney diseases by preventing renal inflammation."
2019,30606987,"Acute and Chronic Antihypertensive Effect of Fractions, Tiliroside and Scopoletin from Malva parviflora.","Hypertension is a disease of high prevalence and morbidity where vascular inflammation and associated oxidative stress (endothelial dysfunction) is the underlying cause of this pathology. We are reporting the antihypertensive activity of extracts and fractions of Malva parviflora in mice with chronic and acute hypertension. Also, the treatments of this plant were able to counteract the kidney inflammation and associated oxidative stress. The chronic hypertension model consisted of administration of angiotensin II (AGII) during 12 weeks, causing a sustained increase in systolic (SBP) or diastolic (DBP) pressure, with values of pharmacological constants of: ED50 = 0.038 mg/kg y Emax = 135 mmHg for SBP and ED50 = 0.046 mg/kg y Emax = 98 mmHg for DBP. The chronic hypertension caused the inflammation and lipid peroxidation in kidneys, measured by of tissue level of cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), IL-10 and malondialdehyde, and treatments for M. parviflora were able to modulate these parameters. The chemical fractionation allowed to identify three compounds: oleanolic acid, tiliroside and scopoletin, which were tested in a model of acute hypertension. The pharmacodynamic parameters for SBP were ED50 = 0.01 and 0.12 mg/kg while Emax = 33.22 and 37.74 mmHg for scopoletin and tiliroside, respectively; whereas that for DBP data were ED50 = 0.01 and 0.02 mg/kg; with an Emax = 7.00 and 6.24 mmHg, in the same order. M. parviflora, is able to counteract the effect of chronic and acute administration of AGII, on hypertension, but also the inflammatory and oxidative damage in the kidney. The oleanolic acid, scopoletin and tiliroside are the compounds responsible for such activities."
2011,21930120,Therapeutic potential of cannabidiol against ischemia/reperfusion liver injury in rats.,"The therapeutic potential of cannabidiol, the major non-psychotropic Cannabis constituent, was investigated in rats exposed to ischemia/reperfusion liver injury. Ischemia was induced by clamping the pedicle of the left hepatic lobe for 30 min, and cannabidiol (5mg/kg, i.v.) was given 1h following the procedure and every 24h thereafter for 2 days. Ischemia/reperfusion caused significant elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide levels, associated with significant decrease in hepatic reduced glutathione. Cannabidiol significantly attenuated the deterioration in the measured biochemical parameters mediated by ischemia/reperfusion. Histopathological examination showed that cannabidiol ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion-induced liver damage. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cannabidiol significantly reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, nuclear factor-κB, Fas ligand and caspase-3, and increased the expression of survivin protein in ischemic/reperfused liver tissue. These results emphasize that cannabidiol represents a potential therapeutic option to protect the liver against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury."
2017,27979238,Addition of calcium compounds to reduce soluble oxalate in a high oxalate food system.,"Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is often used as a base vegetable to make green juices that are promoted as healthy dietary alternatives. Spinach is known to contain significant amounts of oxalates, which are toxic and, if consumed regularly, can lead to the development of kidney stones. This research investigates adding 50-500mg increments of calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium citrate and calcium sulphate to 100g of raw homogenates of spinach to determine whether calcium would combine with the soluble oxalate present in the spinach. Calcium chloride was the most effective additive while calcium carbonate was the least effective. The formation of insoluble oxalate after incubation at 25°C for 30min is a simple practical step that can be incorporated into the juicing process. This would make the juice considerably safer to consume on a regular basis."
2009,19641880,Natural anti-inflammatory compounds for the management and adjuvant therapy of inflammatory bowel disease and its drug delivery system.,This project aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of mastic [(Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia (Anacardiaceae)] extracted from the Chios mastic plant to help reduce intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Mastic and mastic resin were obtained from the Chios Mastiha Growers Association (www.mastihashop.com). The resin was ground into a fine powder using a pestle and mortar and formulated in factorial design manner. Evaluation of the efficacy of specific anti-inflammatory/antioxidant compounds in mitigating the clinical colitis parameters in a mouse model of colitis were performed with mastic itself and combination of tocopherol compounds. Colonic drug delivery system was developed consisting of two compartment model and its release profile was also investigated.
2015,25976821,Phenolic trend and hygienic quality of green table olives fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum starter culture.,"In this paper, four different olive cultivars from Southern Italy, Carolea, Cassanese, Nocellara del Belice, Nocellara Messinese table olives, produced according to traditional fermentation processes, were evaluated with the aim of assessing the effect of selected starter cultures on growth of bacterial population and on olive phenols during fermentation. Only Cassanese and Nocellara del Belice inoculated samples reached a safe pH value under 4.6 after 90 days while maintaining it until the end of storage. The most representative phenols in brine samples analysed by HPLC-MS/MS were hydroxytyrosol and verbascoside. Among the analysed phenols, only hydroxytyrosol, caffeic acid and ferulic acid always increased during fermentation, while the others increased up to 90-120 days and then decreased. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on pH and phenol values highlighted three clusters of olive cultivars. Throughout the brining period, lactic acid bacteria were always present while staphylococci and coliform bacteria disappeared after 30 and 90 days, respectively."
2017,28566637,"2,4-Bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol from Cinnamomum loureirii Improves Cognitive Deficit, Cholinergic Dysfunction, and Oxidative Damage in TMT-Treated Mice.","We previously reported that the extract of Cinnamomum loureirii (C. loureirii) significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and identified 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol (BP) from C. loureirii as a potential AChE inhibitor. The present study, therefore was undertaken to demonstrate the effects of BP from C. loureirii on learning and memory impairment in trimethyltin (TMT)-treated ICR mice. Y-maze and passive avoidance tests were used to test cognitive ability. Further, changes in biochemical parameters in the brain tissue were also assessed in response to TMT injection and BP intervention. BP pre-administration (20, 40 mg/kg/d) in mice significantly protected cognitive dysfunction induced by TMT (p<0.05). Moreover, BP reduced AChE activity and lipid peroxidation but increased acetylcholine levels in the brain. In conclusion, we suggested that BP protected against TMT-induced cognitive dysfunction, and might be a potential agent for alleviating symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, via modulating cholinergic functions."
2010,20629350,Fortification of flour with folic acid.,"After randomized, controlled trials established that consumption of folic acid before pregnancy and during the early weeks of gestation reduces the risk of a neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancy, the United States Public Health Service recommended in 1992 that all women capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 microg folic acid daily. In 1998, folic acid fortification of all enriched cereal grain product flour was fully implemented in the United States and Canada.To provide guidance on national fortification of wheat and maize flours to prevent 50 to 70% of the estimated 300,000 NTD-affected pregnancies worldwide.An expert workgroup reviewed the latest evidence of effectiveness of folic acid flour fortification and the safety of folic acid.Recent estimates show that in the United States and Canada, the additional intake of about 100 to 150 microg/day of folic acid through food fortification has been effective in reducing the prevalence of NTDs at birth and increasing blood folate concentrations in both countries. Most potential adverse effects associated with folic acid are associated with extra supplement use not mandatory fortification. Fortification of wheat flour has a proven record of prevention in other developed countries. In 2009, 51 countries had regulations written for mandatory wheat flour fortification programs that included folic acid.NTDs remain an important cause of perinatal mortality and infantile paralysis worldwide. Mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid has proved to be one of the most successful public health interventions in reducing the prevalence of NTD-affected pregnancies. Most developing countries have few, if any, common sources of folic acid, unlike many developed countries, which have folic acid available from ready-to-eat cereals and supplements. Expanding the number of developed and developing countries with folic acid flour fortification has tremendous potential to safely eliminate most folic acid-preventable NTDs."
2008,18425433,The effect of peripheral administration of zinc on food intake in rats fed Zn-adequate or Zn-deficient diets.,"Zinc deficiency induces a striking reduction of food intake in animals. To elucidate the mechanisms for this effect, two studies were connectedly conducted to determine the effects of peripheral administration of zinc on food intake in rats fed the zinc-adequate or zinc-deficient diets for a 3-week period. In study 1, two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided diets made either adequate (ZA; 38.89 mg/kg) or deficient (ZD; 3.30 mg/kg) in zinc. In study 2, after feeding for 3 weeks, both ZA and ZD groups received intraperitoneal (IP) injection of zinc solution with three levels (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 microg zinc/g body weight, respectively) and cumulative food intake at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h, and plasma hormones concentrations were measured. The results in study 1 showed rats fed the ZD diets revealed symptoms of zinc deficiency, such as sparse and coarse hair, poor appetite, susceptibility to surroundings, lethargy, and small movements. Zinc concentrations in serum, femur, and skeletal muscle of rats fed the ZD diets declined by 26.58% (P < 0.01), 27.32% (P < 0.01), and 24.22% (P < 0.05), respectively, as compared with ZA control group. These findings demonstrated that rat models with zinc deficiency and zinc adequacy had been fully established. The results in study 2 showed that IP administration of zinc in both ZA and ZD rats did not influence food intake at each time points (P > 0.05), although zinc deficiency suppressed food intake. Plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY) was higher, but insulin and glucagon were lower in response to zinc deficiency or zinc administration by contrast with their respective controls (P < 0.05). Leptin, T3, and T4 concentrations were uniformly decreased (P < 0.05) in rats fed the ZD diets in contrast to ZA diets; however, no differences (P > 0.05) were observed during zinc injection. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was unaffected (P > 0.05) by either zinc deficiency or zinc administration. The present studies suggested that zinc administration did not affect short-term food intake in rats even in the zinc-deficient ones; the reduced food intake induced by zinc deficiency was probably associated with the depression in thyroid hormones. The results also indicated that NPY and insulin varied conversely during the control of food intake."
2010,20642450,The effect of licorice drink on the systemic exposure of verapamil in rabbits.,"The effect of licorice root drink (aqueous extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra Fabaceae) on plasma concentration of verapamil, using rabbits as animal model, was investigated. Two groups of locally inbred New Zealand male rabbits were used. The first group was given a single dose of licorice drink (4 ml/kg body weight) concomitantly with 30 mg/kg verapamil, and the second group was given a daily dose of licorice drink (4 ml/kg body weight) for two weeks, with single doses of verapamil on days, 7 and 14. Single dose treatment resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in mean C(max) by 33.2% (P = 0.41), but in a significant decrease of AUC(0-24) and AUC(0-infinity) by 60.5% and 63.6%, respectively (P = 0.01). First period of multiple dose treatment study (7 days), resulted in a significant reduction in mean C(max), AUC(0-24) and AUC(0-infinity) by 55.0%, 47.0% and 45.7%, respectively (P = 0.02, 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). A more pronounced effect was seen at second period of multiple dose treatment study (14 days), where the corresponding decrease was, 85.4%, 76.8% and 73.3%, respectively (P < 0.01). Mean T(max) was significantly increased 4.2-fold over control period at day 14 of multiple dose study (P = 0.02). In conclusion, licorice root drink decreased verapamil systemic exposure both after single dose and after daily doses for 14 days."
1993,8217828,Vitamin K metabolism and vitamin K1 status in human liver samples: a search for inter-individual differences in warfarin sensitivity.,"Vitamin K-dependent parameters in human liver samples were investigated to find a clue to the inter-individual differences in sensitivity for oral anticoagulants. Vitamin K epoxide reductase and vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity differed 2-3-fold between the samples. Microsomal warfarin binding correlated significantly with the reductase activity. Microsomal vitamin K epoxide reductase of the different samples showed equal sensitivity for warfarin inhibition, I50 about 0.1 microM. Vitamin K epoxide reductase activity stimulated by NADH/lipoamide and microsomal lipoamide dehydrogenase activity showed higher inter-subject variability than the reductase activity by itself. Liver vitamin K1 levels varied 4-5-fold. Total and liver microsomal vitamin K1 levels were correlated. One of the liver samples was obtained from a donor anticoagulated with phenprocoumon and additionally treated with vitamin K1. High levels of the vitamin and its epoxide were present. Phenprocoumon was essentially irreversibly bound to the microsomes. In general the results confirm inter-individual differences in the hepatic vitamin K-dependent systems; the differences as such were found to be small. However, as the various parameters can work synergistically in the same direction, they may well account for the wide dose range observed in oral anticoagulant therapy."
2004,15518786,Mucocutaneous lesions in transplant recipient in a tropical country.,"Dermatological manifestations are common in renal transplant patients, but differ markedly with ethnic group and geographical location. We studied mucocutaneous lesions in 54 renal allograft recipients (related donors = 30; unrelated donors = 24) living in tropical atmospheres. Their gender was 50 males, and 4 females ranging in age between 15 and 63 years (mean = 37.84 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 124 months (range = 4 to 173 months). All patients received kidneys from living donors and were kept on immunosupression with mean daily doses of prednisolone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine of 10.2 mg, 68.6 mg, and 252 mg, respectively. The mean trough concentration of cyclosporine was 185 ng/mL. The mucocutaneous lesions were divided into four groups: drug-induced (n = 24, 44.4%), fungal (n = 18, 33.3%), viral (n = 9, 16.6%), and bacterial (n = 10, 18.5%). Cushingoid features, gum hypertrophy, and hypertrichosis were seen in 7 (12.9%) patients. Steroid acne was seen in three cases. Pityriasis versicolor was the most common (20.3%) fungal infection of the skin. In addition, Tinea unguium and mucocutaneous candidiasis were noted in four and three cases respectively. Herpes virus infection (Herpes zoster 5; Herpes simplex 2) was noted in 7 (12.9%) cases. Chicken pox at 5 years posttransplant and cutaneous vasculitis associated with cytomegalovirus disease at 6 months posttransplant were seen in one case each. We have not seen warts in our patients. Pyogenic bacterial infection of skin in the form of abscess (n = 6), cellulitis (n = 3), and pyoderma (n = 1) were observed in 10 (18.5%) patients. Thus, drug-induced mucocutaneous side effects and skin fungal infections are the most common dermatological manifestations among renal transplant recipients living in a tropical country."
2007,17703742,Matrix properties of a new plant gum in controlled drug delivery.,"A new plant gum, Okra (extracted from the pods of Hibiscus esculentus), has been evaluated as a controlled-release agent in modified release matrices, in comparison with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), using Paracetamol as a model drug. Tablets were produced by direct compression and the in-vitro drug release was assessed in conditions mimicking the gastro intestinal system, for 6 h. Okra gum matrices provided a controlled-release of Paracetamol for more than 6 h and the release rates followed time-independent kinetics. The release rates were dependent on the concentration of the drug present in the matrix. The addition of tablet excipients, lactose and Avicel, altered the dissolution profile and the release kinetics. Okra gum compared favourably with NaCMC, and a combination of Okra gum and NaCMC, or on further addition of HPMC resulted in near zeroorder release of paracetamol from the matrix tablet. The results indicate that Okra gum matrices could be useful in the formulation of sustained-release tablets for up to 6 h."
2008,18451538,Antinociceptive activity of (-)-carvone: evidence of association with decreased peripheral nerve excitability.,"(-)-Carvone is a monoterpene ketone that is the main active component of Mentha plant species like Mentha spicata. This study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive activity of (-)-carvone using different experimental models of pain and to investigate whether such effects might be involved in the nervous excitability elicited by others monoterpenes. In the acetic acid-induced writhing test, we observed that (-)-carvone-treated mice exhibited a significant decrease in the number of writhes when 100 and 200 mg/kg was administered. It was also demonstrated that (-)-carvone inhibited the licking response of the injected paw when 100 and 200 mg/kg was administered (i.p.) to mice in the first and second phases of the formalin test. Since naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.), an opioid antagonist, showed no influence on the antinociceptive action of (-)-carvone (100 mg/kg), this suggested nonparticipation of the opioid system in the modulation of pain induced by (-)-carvone. Such results were unlikely to be provoked by motor abnormality, since (-)-carvone-treated mice did not exhibit any performance alteration on the Rota-rod apparatus. Because the antinociceptive effects could be associated with neuronal excitability inhibition, we performed the single sucrose gap technique and observed that (-)-carvone (10 mM) was able to reduce the excitability of the isolated sciatic nerve through a diminution of the compound action potential amplitude by about 50% from control recordings. We conclude that (-)-carvone has antinociceptive activity associated with decreased peripheral nerve excitability."
2018,29842870,Impact of prepubertal exposure to dietary protocatechuic acid on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in rats.,"Protocatechuic acid (PCA; 3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is a phenolic compound widely found in many edible fruits, vegetables, grape wine and plant-derived beverages. The present study investigated the impact of PCA on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis of rats orally treated with PCA during the period of prepubertal development to adulthood. Protocatechuic acid was administered to prepubertal male rats at doses of 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg body for 45 consecutive days. The results revealed no treatment-related changes in the body weight gain and organo-somatic indices of the hypothalamus, testes, epididymis, prostate gland and seminal vesicle in rats administered with PCA when compared with control. However, prepubertal exposure to PCA significantly enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione level whereas it markedly decreased biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the hypothalamus, testes and epididymis of the treated rats. Protocatechuic acid significantly increased circulatory concentrations of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone with concomitant increase in serum and intra-testicular testosterone levels. Moreover, PCA-treated rats exhibited significant increase in marker enzymes of testicular function namely acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase without statistically significant increase in spermatogenesis and sperm functional characteristics including sperm count, motility and viability. Light microscopic examination of the hypothalamus, testes and epididymis of rats treated with PCA showed histo-architectures similar to control. In conclusion, prepubertal exposure to PCA is safe and positively impacted reproductive function at sexual maturity in male rats. The observed beneficial effects of PCA is related to its anti-inflammatory and redox regulatory mechanisms."
2015,25802070,"Effective suppression of pro-inflammatory molecules by DHCA via IKK-NF-κB pathway, in vitro and in vivo.","Dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DHCA), a lignan compound isolated from Cucurbita moschata, has previously been shown to contain anti-adipogenic and antilipogenic effects on 3T3-L1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. As some of phytochemicals derived from natural plants show anti-inflammatory or antioxidative activities, we determined whether DHCA affects the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and also investigated its underlying mechanisms.Raw264.7, a murine macrophage cell line, and primary murine macrophages derived from bone marrow cells were treated with LPS in the presence of DHCA. Furthermore, cells were treated with LPS and palmitate in the presence of DHCA to examine its effect on inflammasomes. The production of various pro-inflammatory mediators was examined and the underlying mechanisms investigated using a variety of molecular biological techniques. To test whether DHCA exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, mouse dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model was used.DHCA reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and CCL2) and mediators (iNOS, COX-2 and ROS) by down-regulating the activity of I-κB kinase and, subsequently, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Moreover, DHCA effectively suppressed the palmitate-mediated activation of inflammasomes, which resulted in decreased production of IL-1β. DHCA also showed therapeutic effects in the mouse DSS-induced colitis model by suppressing the production of TNF-α and IL-1β and thus preventing weight loss and colon shrinkage.Our data suggest that DHCA is a novel phytochemical that by regulating key molecules involved in inflammation and oxidative stress might exert a broad range of anti-inflammatory activities."
1992,1358016,"Modulation, in vivo and in vitro, of surface expression of CD18 by bovine neutrophils.","A series of experiments was designed to elucidate some of the factors that may influence surface expression of CD18 by bovine neutrophils. Expression of CD18 was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Neutrophils recovered from the uterus of cows (n = 9) after intrauterine administration of sterile oyster glycogen solution expressed (mean +/- SD) 123 +/- 21% more CD18 than did circulating neutrophils recovered simultaneously from the same cows (P = 0.003). In 8 cows given 20 mg of dexamethasone IM daily for 3 days, expression of CD18 on blood neutrophils was 29.6 +/- 8% less after treatment than before treatment (P = 0.0078). Neutrophils from 12 cows or bulls exposed to phorbol myristate acetate in vitro increased expression of CD18 by 137 +/- 37% (P = 0.0035). Likewise, exposure of neutrophils from 8 cattle to zymosan-activated bovine plasma increased CD18 exposure by 10.6 +/- 3.8% (P = 0.029). These findings indicate that expression of CD18 by bovine neutrophils is a dynamic system, capable of responding to inflammatory stimuli. Inadvertent activation of neutrophils may be responsible for some of the variance in expression observed when examining large groups of cattle for CD18 expression by neutrophils. The ability of bovine neutrophils to respond rapidly to various stimuli by increasing surface expression of CD18 indicates that a pool of intracellular CD18 may be available for inclusion in the plasmalemma, as has been reported for human neutrophils."
2002,12065059,Inhibition of phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) by quercetin in human adult and foetal livers.,"1. Quercetin is one of the most abundant flavonoids in edible vegetables, fruit and wine. The aim was to study the type of inhibition of SULT1A1 by quercetin in the human adult and foetal livers. 2. The activity of SULT1A1 was measured with 4 microM 4-nitrophenol and 0.4 microM 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulphate-[(35)S], and its mean (+/-SD) and median were 769 +/- 311 and 740 pmol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively (adult liver, n = 10), and 185 +/- 98 and 201 pmol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively (foetal liver, n = 8, p < 0.0001). 3. In non-inhibited samples, K(m) for SULT1A1 (mean +/- SD) was 0.31 +/- 0.14 microM (adult liver) and 0.49 +/- 0.17 microM (foetal liver, n.s.). V(max) for SULT1A1 (mean +/- SD) was 885 +/- 135 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (adult liver) and 267 +/- 93 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (foetal liver, p = 0.007). 4. The IC(50) of quercetin for SULT1A1 was measured in three samples of adult and foetal livers and was 13 +/- 2.1 and 12 +/- 1.4 nM, respectively. 5. The type of inhibition was mixed non-competitive in adult and foetal livers and K(i) was 4.7 +/- 2.5 nM (adult liver) and 4.8 +/- 1.6 nM (foetal liver). 6. In the adult liver, the intrinsic clearance (mean +/- SD) was 3.3 +/- 1.5 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (non-inhibited samples), 0.9 +/- 0.4 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (12.5 nM quercetin) and 0.5 +/- 0.06 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (25 nM quercetin). In the foetal liver, the intrinsic clearance (mean +/- SD) was 0.5 +/- 0.2 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (non-inhibited samples), 0.12 +/- 0.01 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (12.5 nM quercetin) and 0.2 +/- 0.09 ml min(-1) mg(-1) (25 nM quercetin). 7. In conclusion, quercetin is a potent inhibitor of human adult and foetal liver SULT1A1. It reduces the sulphation rate and intrinsic clearance of 4-nitrophenol in both human adult and foetal livers. This suggests that quercetin may inhibit the sulfation rate of those drugs sulphated by SULT1A1. The inhibition of SULT1A1 is complex and not due solely to competition at the catalytic site of SULT1A1."
2012,21824633,The advantages of using a combination of LDL and glutamine in comparison with TRIS egg yolk and Equex® STAMP extenders in the cryopreservation of canine semen.,"Twenty semen samples taken from 5 dogs were frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C in four different extenders: one control extender based on 20% egg yolk, 6% LDL alone (low density lipoproteins: the active cryoprotective principle in chicken egg yolk), 6% LDL combined with 20 mmol glutamine, and Equex® (a reference extender that we wish to compare with the LDL-glutamine combination). After thawing, spermatozoal motility was evaluated using a HAMILTON THORNE CERROS 12 image analyzer; the percentage of motile spermatozoa was 27.7% in the egg yolk extender (p<0.05), 49.9% with 6% LDL alone (p>0.05), 54.7% in the 6% LDL+20 mmol glutamine extender, and 47.9% with Equex® (p>0.05). The motility parameters (VAP, VCL, VSL and ALH) were also superior in the 6% LDL+20 mmol glutamine extender in comparison with the other extenders. Finally, the spermatozoa were generally better protected during freezing with the 6% LDL+20 mmol glutamine association than with the egg yolk, 6% LDL, or Equex extenders in terms of the flagellar plasma membrane (HOS test), DNA (Acridine orange test), and acrosome integrity (Spermac® test: no significant difference). The Equex® extender obtained the best results for the acrosome, followed by 6% LDL+20 mmol glutamine (FITC-PSA test: p<0.05 between each extender)."
2019,31253285,Chemical features and bioactivity of grain flours colonized by macrofungi as a strategy for nutritional enrichment.,"Agaricus blazei, Auricularia fuscosuccinea and Pleurotus albidus mycelia were obtained in solid-state cultivation (SSC), using grains (brown rice, canjica corn and wheat) as raw material. Colonized grain flours were analysed for their nutritional, physical and physico-chemical characteristics and biological activity in vitro. Wheat flour with P. albidus showed higher values for protein (18.34 g/100 g), ergosterol (0.60 mg/g), mycelial biomass (183 mg/g) and total amino acids (58.34 mg/g). Corn flour with A. fuscosuccinea showed the highest total phenolic content (2.38 mg GAE/g), antioxidant activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (8.90 μmol TEAC/g) and 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (16.52 μmol TEAC/g) assay. Wheat flour with P. albidus were more effective at inhibiting of pancreatic lipase (74.5%) and of α-glucosidase (98.2%). In conclusion, grains colonized by macrofungi mycelia through SSC can enrich the nutritional value and the biological activity of the flours, which presents a potential for functional foods."

The study of the prescription containing mineral drug with adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate phosphodiesterase].","Twenty five Chinese herbal medicinal prescriptions containing gypsum, kaolin, longgu, oyster shell and sodium sulfate were studied for the inhibitory activity of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate phosphodiesterase. The inhibitory activity of 15 prescriptions without mineral drug was higher than that of each original prescription. On the contrary, four were lower and six were not recognized to be different. All 11 prescriptions containing gypsum with an exception increased the inhibitory activity by removing gypsum. The half prescriptions containing kaolin or sodium sulfate also increased the inhibitory activity by removing the drug."
2020,30927245,Animals in Iodine Deficiency or Sulfadimethoxine Models of Thyroid Damage Are Differently Affected by the Consumption of Brassica Sprouts.,"The study was primarily aimed at investigating the effect of brassica sprout consumption, namely rutabaga (Brassica napus L. var. napobrassica) sprouts (R) generally recognized as antithyroid agent due to its goitrogenic substance content, on hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters in rats. Sprouts were tested alone and in a combination with other antithyroid factors, such as iodine deficiency (RDI) and sulfadimethoxine (RS). The expression of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene in the thyroid as a stress-inducible protein was determined. The thermographic analysis was also estimated. The intake of rutabaga sprouts by healthy rats did not reveal any significant, harmful effect on the thyroid function. Both body temperature and expression of HO-1 remained unchanged in response to the consumed sprouts. In animals with hypothyroidism, rutabaga sprouts enhanced the negative effect of iodine deficiency or sulfadimethoxine ingestion on the organism by increasing the WBC (RDI), TNF-α (RS), creatinine (RS), and triglyceride (RDI and RS) levels, as well as decreasing PLT (RS) level. Moreover, rutabaga sprout consumption by rats with iodine deficiency and sulfadimethoxine decreased their body temperature. Additionally, the concomitant administration of sprouts and iodine depletion significantly reduced the expression of HO-1 in the thyroid. The results may prove useful in confirming rutabaga sprout consumption to be safe, though the seeds of this vegetable provide a well-known antithyroid agent. Our results have shown that rutabaga sprout consumption may be also a factor that enhances the negative clinical features only when combined with iodine deficiency and sulfadimethoxine ingestion."
1997,9113109,Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761): inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) on the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. EGb 761 inhibited nitrite and nitrate production, taken as an index for NO, in a concentration-dependent fashion. The IC50 for inhibition of nitrite production by activated macrophages was about 100 micrograms/mL EGb 761. The inducible NO synthase (iNOS) enzyme activity of cytosolic preparations from activated RAW 264.7 cells was inhibited by treatment with EGb 761. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the expression of iNOS mRNA in activated macrophages was suppressed by high concentrations of EGb 761. However, NF-kappa B DNA binding activity induced by activation with LPS/IFN-gamma was not inhibited by EGb 761. These findings indicate that not only does EGb 761 directly act as an NO scavenger but also that it inhibits NO production in LPS/IFN-gamma-activated macrophages by concomitant inhibition of induction of iNOS mRNA and the enzyme activity of iNOS. Thus, EGb 761 may act as a potent inhibitor of NO production under tissue-damaging inflammatory conditions."
2012,23179953,Berberine attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury via regulation of adenosine-5'-monophosphate kinase activity in both non-ischemic and ischemic areas of the rat heart.,"Berberine exhibits numerous pharmacological effects, but the mechanism for its protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion cardiac injury is unknown.Male Wistar rats were treated with berberine (100 mg/Kg/day, ig) for 14 days and controls treated with water. Hearts were isolated in vitro and perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion and hemodynamic data examined. In a separate set of experiments, hearts were subjected in vivo to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 30 min followed by 120 min reperfusion and hemodynamic data, type and duration of arrhythmias, and myocardial infarct size determined. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level, ADP/ATP and AMP/ATP ratios were examined in non-ischemic areas and risk areas of the heart.Subsequent to ischemia-reperfusion injury, left ventricular developed pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure and maximum rate of intraventricular pressure contractility and relaxation were significantly improved in the berberine treatment groups compared to controls. Berberine treatment decreased infarct size and diminished the duration and incidence of arrhythmias compared to controls. Berberine treatment significantly decreased AMPK protein concentration, and the ratio of ADP/ATP and AMP/ATP in the myocardial risk areas. In contrast, berberine treatment significantly increased AMPK protein concentration, and the ratio of ADP/ATP and AMP/ATP in the non-ischemia areas compared to controls.These findings suggest that berberine may exert its cardioprotective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury via regulation of AMPK activity in both non-ischemic areas and risk areas of the heart."

Scanning electron microscopic analysis of sections of celery revealed that silver particles were deposited on the secondary wall thickenings, indicating that the staining was due to the deposition of silver through the interaction of the stain with lignin. This method is more sensitive than the acidified phloroglucinol method."
1992,1348152,"[Primary decontamination: vomiting, gastric irrigation or only medicinal charcoal?].","Procedures to reduce the absorption of ingested poisons have been employed widely for decades in the management of intoxicated patients. However, evidence of substantial clinical benefit to the majority of patients undergoing such treatments is lacking. Volunteer studies suggest that activated charcoal is generally more effective than either syrup of ipecacuanha or gastric lavage, though lavage may be more effective than syrup of ipecacuanha. Studies in poisoned patients have shown that although lavage is more effective than syrup of ipecacuanha, it led to a better outcome in comatose patients only if performed less than one hour after overdose. Syrup of ipecacuanha did not alter the outcome beneficially in those who were alert on presentation and is known to produce significantly more complications than charcoal alone even in patients who are awake with a gag reflex. A recent study suggests that activated charcoal may be superior both to lavage and syrup of ipecacuanha. Based on these studies it would seem reasonable to recommend that 50 to 100 g activated charcoal be administered to patients who have taken a substantial amount of a toxic substance less than one hour previously. This may be done conveniently by using an orogastric tube, which would also allow lavage to be undertaken with possible additional benefit."
2007,17666828,Cell wall beta-glucan derived from Candida albicans acts as a trigger for autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice.,"SKG mice are a recently established experimental model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although they spontaneously develop chronic autoimmune arthritis under conventional conditions, SKG mice failed to develop chronic arthritis in a strictly controlled specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment. Beta-glucan (BG) from Laminaria digitata, laminarin (LAM), induced arthritis under SPF conditions, thus BG would be a pathogenic factor for arthritis in SKG mice. Therefore, we prepared BG from Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus and investigated whether BG from C. albicans induced arthritis in SKG mice under SPF conditions. SKG mice were injected intraperitoneally with particulate BG (oxidative-Candida albicans (OX-CA)), soluble BG (Candida soluble beta-glucan (CSBG)) from C. albicans and LAM as a positive control. In addition, schizophyllan (SPG) from Schizophyllum commune or Mycobacterium whole cells were injected into SKG mice to induce arthritis. Mice injected with OX-CA, CSBG and SPG had more severe arthritis than with LAM, and whole Mycobacterium cells. IL-6 concentration in sera from SKG mice injected with OX-CA or CSBG was high, whereas not detected in sera from mice treated with LAM. In histological analysis, infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in SKG mice injected with BG. These results suggest that fungal infection may be a factor to induce and exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as RA."
2009,19571387,"Anti-clastogenic effect of magnolol-containing Hange-koboku-to, Dai-joki-to, Goshaku-san, and Magnoliae Cortex on benzo(a)pyrene-induced clastogenicity in mice.","Magnolol was previously shown to inhibit genotoxicity induced by environmental mutagens both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we investigate the effects of the magnolol-containing kampo (traditional) medicines Hange-koboku-to, Dai-joki-to, and Goshaku-san, as well as Magnoliae Cortex, on the clastogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) using the mouse micronucleus test. The mice were first treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of B(a)P, followed by a single oral dose of Hange-koboku-to, Dai-joki-to, Goshaku-san, or Magnoliae Cortex. Peripheral blood specimens were prepared 48 h after B(a)P administration and analyzed using the acridine orange (AO) technique. The anti-clastogenic mechanisms employed by the kampo medicines and Magnoliae Cortex were also investigated by evaluating in vivo CYP1A1 activity using the zoxazolamine paralysis test. Results show that Hange-koboku-to, Dai-joki-to, and Magnoliae Cortex, which contain high levels of magnolol, significantly inhibited the clastogenesis induced by B(a)P and sufficiently inhibited in vivo CYP1A1 activity. In contrast, Goshaku-san, which contains low levels of magnolol, had little inhibitory effect on clastogenicity and in vivo CYP1A1 activity. These findings suggest that magnolol is a major contributor to the inhibition of B(a)P-induced clastogenesis, and that kampo medicines exert significant anti-clastogenic effects."
1997,9250142,Role of food in the stimulation of cytokine production.,"To study the role of food in the stimulation of cytokine production, the effects of lactic bacteria on production of interferon alpha, beta, and gamma; interleukin 1 beta; and tumor necrosis factor alpha were evaluated in mice and humans. Yogurt bacteria induced plasma interferon alpha and beta production in mice. Yogurt intake containing 10(11) bacteria led to increased 2'-5' A synthetase activity in human blood mononuclear cells. This result may suggest an interferon action in a peripheral way. This effect was also found when subjects consumed 10(8) yogurt bacteria/d for 15 d. In an in vitro model, blood mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of yogurt bacteria produced interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon alpha and gamma. These results suggest the involvement of a certain type of food in cytokine production under healthy conditions."
2017,28519901,Inhibition of soil microbial activity by nitrogen-based energetic materials.,"We investigated individual toxicities of the nitrogen-based energetic materials (EMs) 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT); 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT); 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT); and nitroglycerin (NG) on microbial activity in Sassafras sandy loam (SSL) soil, which has physicochemical characteristics that support very high qualitative relative bioavailability for organic chemicals. Batches of SSL soil for basal respiration (BR) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) assays were separately amended with individual EMs or acetone carrier control. Total microbial biomass carbon (biomass C) was determined from CO2 production increases after addition of 2500 mg/kg of glucose-water slurry to the soil. Exposure concentrations of each EM in soil were determined using US Environmental Protection Agency method 8330A. Basal respiration was the most sensitive endpoint for assessing the effects of nitroaromatic EMs on microbial activity in SSL, whereas SIR and biomass C were more sensitive endpoints for assessing the effects of NG in soil. The orders of toxicity (from greatest to least) were 4-ADNT > 2,4-DNT = 2-ADNT > NG for BR; but for SIR and biomass C, the order of toxicity was NG > 2,4-DNT > 2-ADNT = 4-ADNT. No inhibition of SIR was found up to and including the greatest concentration of each ADNT tested in SSL. These ecotoxicological data will be helpful in identifying concentrations of contaminant EMs in soil that present acceptable ecological risks for biologically mediated processes in soil.

GBE showed a promoting effect on the hair regrowth. GBE had the inhibitory effects on blood platelet aggregation, thrombin activity and fibrinolysis. GBE inhibited the increase of serum the triglyceride level in high cholesterol diet-treated rats. These results suggested that GBE promotes the hair regrowth and could be used as a hair tonic."
1983,6651228,Chemical and nutritional evaluation of sweet lupines.,"Sweet lupines are presently being cultivated at the Experimental Station in Gorbea (Chile). Four cultivars, Lupinus albus cv Astra, L. albus cv Multolupa, Lupinus luteus cv Aurea and Lupinus angustifolius, were examined for the chemical composition of whole and dehulled seeds and testa. Whole seeds contain 34-35% protein. The varieties of L. albus contain 13% oil. L. luteus and L. angustifolius contain about 5% ether extract. Crude fiber ranged from 11 to 17% in the whole seed. Unsaturated fatty acids, especially oleic and linoleic, make up about 80% of total fatty acids. The alkaloid content of the seed was 0.02%. The amino acid composition of the protein indicated that the main deficiency corresponds to the sulfur-containing amino acids, i.e. methionine + cystine. The protein efficiency ratio values for L. albus cv Multolupa was 1.08 and 2.50 for casein. Supplementation with DL-methionine at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4% of the diet significantly increased the basal value from 1.08 to 2.14, for the supplemented diet with 0.1% (p less than 0.01). Higher levels of supplementation did not cause significant increases in the protein efficiency ratio. Apparent protein digestibility for the rat was 75% for unsupplemented lupine. This value increased to about 79% (p less than 0.01) for the supplemented diets (casein 88.7%)."
2000,11049985,Platelet release of trimolecular complex components MT1-MMP/TIMP2/MMP2: involvement in MMP2 activation and platelet aggregation.,"Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) has been reported to be secreted by collagen-stimulated platelets, and active MMP2 has been shown to play a role in platelet aggregation. It has been demonstrated that MMP2 activation is dependent on the complex (membrane type 1 [MT1]-MMP/tissue inhibitor of MMP2 [TIMP2]) receptor and MMP2. We have investigated human platelets as a possible source of MT1-MMP, and we have studied its role in MMP2 activation and in platelet aggregation. Gelatin zymograms showed the existence of MMP2 at proforms (68 kd) and activated-enzyme forms (62-59 kd) in supernatants of resting and activated platelets, respectively. No gelatinolytic activity was associated with the platelet pellet after aggregation, suggesting a total release of MMP2 during cell activation. By Western blot analysis in nonreduced conditions, MT1-MMP was found on resting platelet membranes in 2 forms-the inactive 45-kd form and an apparent 89-kd form, which totally disappeared under reduced conditions. After platelet degranulation, only the 45-kd form was detected. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed the expression in platelets of messenger RNA encoding for MMP2, MT1-MMP, and TIMP2. Flow cytometry analysis showed that MT1-MMP, MMP2, and TIMP2 expressions were enhanced at the activated platelet surface. MMP inhibitors, recombinant TIMP2, and synthetic BB94 inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the role of activated MT1-MMP in the modulation of platelet function. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the expression of the trimolecular complex components (MT1-MMP/TIMP2/MMP2) by blood platelets as well as the ability of MMP inhibitors to modulate the aggregating response."
2001,11487044,Roles of platelets and factor XI in the initiation of blood coagulation by thrombin.,"To account for the variable hemostatic defect in patients with factor XI (FXI) deficiency, with normal hemostasis in contact factor deficiencies, a coagulation paradigm is presented whereby trace quantities of thrombin, generated transiently by exposure of tissue factor at sites of vascular injury, activates FXI bound to the platelet surface in the presence of prothrombin or high Mr kininogen (HK). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) limits the flux of thrombin generated by the tissue factor pathway, and protease nexin II (PNII), released from activated platelets, inhibits solution phase FXIa and localizes FIX activation to the platelet surface where FXIa is protected from inactivation by PNII. Either prothrombin or HK binds to the Apple 1 (A1) domain of FXI, thereby exposing a platelet-binding site in the FXI A3 domain. Dimeric FXI binds to activated platelets directly through the A3 domain of one monomer. After proteolytic activation of platelet-bound FXI by thrombin (or FXIIa), a substrate binding site for FIX is exposed in the opposite monomer that promotes FIX activation on the platelet surface resulting in the local explosive generation of thrombin and the formation of hemostatic thrombi at sites of vascular injury."
1988,3223640,[Automated monitoring of respiratory parameters in the anesthetized patient in mechanical respiration].,"The constant monitoring of respiratory elastance and resistance can be of interest in patients who present a high risk of peroperative bronchospasm. The constant inspiratory flow method, proposed by Bates et al. (J Appl Physiol, 58: 1840, 1985) was chosen and automated. The inspiratory flow rate and pressure were measured respectively by a pneumotachograph linked to a differential pressure, and by a differential pressure transducer, both placed at the outlet of the inspiratory circuit. The pressure and flow signals were low-pass filtered, sampled, and then processed by an Apple II microcomputer, in order to obtain respiratory elastance and resistance. New results were displayed on the screen about every minute. The automated method was first tested in a series of 18 guinea-pigs; the respiratory parameters were compared with those obtained by the occlusion method proposed by Rossi et al. (J Appl Physiol, 58: 1849, 1985). They were found not significantly different and very strongly correlated (p less than 0.001). The ability of the constant flow method to detect changes in respiratory mechanics was then tested in a series of nine patients, after anaesthetic induction. The results obtained were in accordance with those previously published: a rise in both respiratory elastance and resistance. After giving 1 mg atropine intravenously, the respiratory resistance fell rapidly over a 5 min period, and then reached a plateau. The constant flow method, which avoids interruption in the mechanical ventilation and is sensitive to small changes in respiratory parameters, appears particularly convenient for the peroperative monitoring of patients."
2001,11705464,"Immunomodulatory activity of resveratrol: suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, development of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine production.","trans-Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes, wine, and other plant products, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities. Many of these beneficial effects of resveratrol require participation of the cells of the immune system; however, the effect of resveratrol on the development of immunological responses remains unknown. We have investigated the effect of resveratrol on mitogen/antigen-induced proliferation of splenic lymphocytes, induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, and the production of the cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-12. We found that mitogen-, IL-2-, or alloantigen-induced proliferation of splenic lymphocytes and the development of antigen-specific CTLs were suppressed significantly at 25-50 microM resveratrol. The generation of LAK cells at similar concentrations was less sensitive to the suppressive effect of resveratrol. The suppression of cell proliferation and CTL generation by resveratrol was not only reversible, but in some cases the response (mitogen/IL-2-induced proliferation and CTL generation) was actually enhanced following pretreatment of cells with resveratrol. Resveratrol also inhibited the production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by splenic lymphocytes, and the production of TNF-alpha and IL-12 by peritoneal macrophages. The inhibition of cytokine production by resveratrol was irreversible. Further, resveratrol blocked the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB without affecting basal NF-kappaB activity. The latter result suggests that resveratrol inhibits cell proliferation, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine production, at least in part through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation."
2007,17213652,Human MDR1 and MRP1 recognize berberine as their transport substrate.,"To examine whether human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a role in the detoxification of plant alkaloid berberine, we investigated berberine transport using multidrug resistance protein1 (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein1 (MRP1). Cells expressing MDR1 or MRP1 accumulated less berberine. Berberine accumulation depended on the cellular ATP level, and was reversed by typical inhibitors of MDR1, suggesting that human MDR1 and MRP1 directly efflux berberine as their substrate."
2015,25987270,Zinc Regulates Lipid Metabolism and MMPs Expression in Lipid Disturbance Rabbits.,"Lipid disturbance induced by high-fat diet is a worldwide problem, and it can induce inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo. Zinc is considered as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent. Since matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9)'s expressions are changed under many pathological conditions, we would like to know how zinc affects lipid metabolism and MMP2, MMP9's expressions in the lipid disturbance rabbits. Twenty-four male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had six rabbits, and they were fed with regular diet, high-fat diet, high-fat diet+zinc, and regular diet+zinc separately for 12 weeks. High-fat diet induced lipid disturbance significantly which raised the level of aspartate aminotransferase (p<0.01) and alanine transaminase (p<0.05) in the high-fat diet group, but zinc supplement reversed this phenomenon (p<0.05). Zinc did not reduce total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p>0.05), but it lowered triglyceride (TG) and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p<0.01). Zinc also reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p<0.01) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)'s expressions (p<0.05). Zinc reduced the epicardial adipose tissue and alleviated the hepatic steatosis. Zinc suppressed MMP2 and MMP9's expressions in vivo, but it did not alleviate the aorta fatty streak's severity in the lipid disturbance rabbits. Zinc protected the liver, reduced TG, hs-CRP, and IL-6 and raised HDL-C in the lipid disturbance rabbits. Zinc suppressed MMP2 and MMP9's expressions in vivo, but it did not alleviate the severity of aorta fatty streak induced by the high-fat diet."
2013,23583258,Phenolic compounds present in Sardinian wine extracts protect against the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxysterols in CaCo-2 human enterocyte-like cells.,"Cholesterol auto-oxidation products, namely oxysterols, are widely present in cholesterol-rich foods. They are thought to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the human digestive tract, playing a role in intestinal mucosal damage. This report concerns the marked up-regulation in differentiated CaCo-2 colonic epithelial cells of two key inflammatory interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, caused by a mixture of oxysterols representative of a high cholesterol diet. This strong pro-inflammatory effect appeared to be dependent on the net imbalance of red-ox equilibrium with the production of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species through the colonic NADPH-oxidase NOX1 activation. Induction of NOX1 was markedly while not fully inhibited by CaCo-2 cell pre-incubation with phenolic extracts obtained from well-selected wines from typical grape varieties grown in Sardinia. Oxysterol-dependent NOX1 activation, as well as interleukin synthesis, were completely prevented by Cannonau red wine extract that contains an abundant phenolic fraction, in particular phenolic acids and flavonoids. Conversely, cell pre-treatment with Vermentino white wine extract with smaller phenolic fraction showed only a partial NOX1 down-regulation and was ineffective in interleukin synthesis induced by dietary oxysterols. It is thus likely that the effects of Sardinian wine extracts against intestinal inflammation induced by dietary oxysterols are mainly due to their high phenolic content: low doses of phenolics would be responsible only for direct scavenging oxysterol-dependent ROS production. Besides this direct activity, an excess of phenolic compounds detectable in red wine, may exert an additional indirect action by blocking oxysterol-related NOX1 induction, thus totally preventing the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory events triggered by dietary oxysterols."

We hypothesize nuciferine might affect vascular reactivity. This study aimed at determining the effects of nuciferine on vasomotor tone and the underlying mechanismNuciferine-induced relaxations in rings of rat main mesenteric arteries were measured by wire myographs. Endothelial NOS (eNOS) was determined by immunoblotting. Intracellular NO production in HUVECs and Ca(2+) level in both HUVECs and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from rat mesenteric arteries were assessed by fluorescence imaging.Nuciferine induced relaxations in arterial segments pre-contracted by KCl or phenylephrine. Nuciferine-elicited arterial relaxations were reduced by removal of endothelium or by pretreatment with the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME or the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ. In HUVECs, the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1177) and increase in cytosolic NO level induced by nuciferine were mediated by extracellular Ca(2+) influx. Under endothelium-free conditions, nuciferine attenuated CaCl2-induced contraction in Ca(2+)-free depolarizing medium. In the absence of extracellular calcium, nuciferine relieved the vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine and the addition of CaCl2. Nuciferine also suppressed Ca(2+) influx in Ca(2+)-free K(+)-containing solution in VSMCs.Nuciferine has a vasorelaxant effect via both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These results suggest that nuciferine may have a therapeutic effect on vascular diseases associated with aberrant vasoconstriction."
2016,26801102,Flavonoids of Polygonum hydropiper L. attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory injury via suppressing phosphorylation in MAPKs pathways.,"Polygonum hydropiper L. is widely used as a traditional remedy for the treatment of dysentery, gastroenteritis. It has been used to relieve swelling and pain, dispel wind and remove dampness, eliminate abundant phlegm and inflammatory for a long time. Previous study showed that antioxidants especially flavonoids pretreatment alleviated sepsis-induced injury in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, the possible anti-inflammatory effect of flavonoids from normal butanol fraction of Polygonum hydropiper L. extract (FNP) against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was evaluated in vivo and in vitro.The content of total flavonoid of FNP was determined by the aluminum colorimetric method. The content of rutin, quercetin and quercitrin was determined by HPLC method. Mice received FNP orally 3 days before an intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Total superoxidase dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), glutathione (GSH), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Tumor necrosis factor-α levels in serum and tissue was measured. mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung were assessed by Real-Time PCR. Histopathological changes were evaluated in lung, ileum and colon. We also investigated FNP on reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression, phosphorylation of MAPKs and AMPK in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.FNP increased the levels of T-SOD, T-AOC, GSH-PX and GSH, decreased the levels of TNF-α, MPO and MDA, attenuate the histopathological lesion in LPS-stimulated mice. FNP inhibited production of inflammatory cytokines, ROS and NO, protein expressions of iNOS and COX-2, phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and c-JUN in MAPKs, promoted phosphorylation of AMPKα suppressed by LPS.These results suggested in vivo anti-inflammatory activities of FNP might contributed to its enhancement in antioxidant capacity, its inhibitory effects may be mediated by inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and c-JUN in MAPKs signaling pathways."
2018,28946294,The use of atmospheric pressure plasma as a curing process for canned ground ham.,"This study investigated the potential use of atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatment as a curing process for canned ground ham. APP treatment for 60min while mixing increased the nitrite content in the meat batters from 0.64 to 60.50mgkg-1 while the pH and the total content of aerobic bacteria in the meat batters were unchanged. The canned ground hams cured by the APP treatment for 30min displayed no difference in their physicochemical qualities, such as nitrosyl hemochrome, color, residual nitrite, texture, lipid oxidation, and protein oxidation, compared with those of canned ground hams cured with sodium nitrite or celery powder at 42mgkg-1 of nitrite. The canned ground hams cured by the APP treatment received a higher score in taste and overall acceptability than those cured with sodium nitrite. Canned ground ham can be cured by the APP treatment without nitrite additives."
2011,20661235,European guidelines for antifungal management in leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: summary of the ECIL 3--2009 update.,"In 2005, several groups, including the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the European Organization for Treatment and Research of Cancer, the European Leukemia Net and the Immunocompromised Host Society created the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL). The main goal of ECIL is to elaborate guidelines, or recommendations, for the management of infections in leukemia and stem cell transplant patients. The first sets of ECIL slides about the management of invasive fungal disease were made available on the web in 2006 and the papers were published in 2007. The third meeting of the group (ECIL 3) was held in September 2009 and the group updated its previous recommendations. The goal of this paper is to summarize the new proposals from ECIL 3, based on the results of studies published after the ECIL 2 meeting: (1) the prophylactic recommendations for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were formulated differently, by splitting the neutropenic and the GVHD phases and taking into account recent data on voriconazole; (2) micafungin was introduced as an alternative drug for empirical antifungal therapy; (3) although several studies were published on preemptive antifungal approaches in neutropenic patients, the group decided not to propose any recommendation, as the only randomized study comparing an empirical versus a preemptive approach showed a significant excess of fungal disease in the preemptive group."
2016,27132834,"Development of a novel gold nanoparticle-based method to determine antioxidant capacity of Brassica oilseeds, white flakes and meal.","Antioxidant capacity (AC) of Brassica oilseeds, white flakes and meal was determined by a new spectrophotometric method. The proposed assay (AuNP) based on the formation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in an acetic buffer medium (pH=4.6) was compared with the previously described silver nanoparticle-based (AgNP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) procedures. The novel AuNP method was validated using standard antioxidants such as phenolic acids and quercetin. The AC of rapeseed, white flakes and meal varied from 10.0 to 86.7μmolsinapicacid(SA)/g, 26.5-160.3μmolSA/g, 6.8-103.0μmolSA/g, 23.0-259.3μmolSA/g and 6.9-92.1μmolSA/g for AuNP, AgNP, FRAP, DPPH and FC methods, respectively. The proposed AuNP method is simple, precise (intra-day RSD=0.27-2.11% and inter-day RSD=2.05-4.87%) and accurate (recovery=96.2-104.3%) and can be useful in the routine analysis of the AC. "
2017,28317758,Analysis of free and total sulfur dioxide in wine by using a gas-diffusion analytical system with pH detection.,"The use of sulfur dioxide as preservative in winemaking industry has a direct impact on wine quality. The standard methods to analyze this parameter require several processes and are time consuming. In this paper a simple and rapid analytical method for free and total sulfur dioxide detection is proposed. This method is based on the separation of the analyte from the sample with a permeable gas diffusion membrane and its indirect detection with a pH sensor. The system has been validated and optimized for free sulfur dioxide detection in the range of 1-60mgL-1 and for total sulfur dioxide in the range of 30-300mgL-1 with a limit of detection of 0.5mgL-1. Validation of the system has been carried out using a total of 70 samples of white and red wines and two standard methods, the Ripper and the Paul method. The obtained values have demonstrated a good agreement for both methods."
2018,30169119,"Prevalence, Enterotoxin Genes, and Antibiotic Resistance of Bacillus cereus Isolated from Raw Vegetables in Korea.","Bacillus cereus has long been recognized as an important pathogen in foodborne poisoning worldwide. Fresh vegetables are often contaminated with enterotoxigenic B. cereus and have been implicated as a vehicle for the transmission of this bacterium. This study reports on the occurrence, virulence gene profile, and antibiotic resistance of B. cereus in fresh vegetables. Of 102 examined samples, 48 (47%) of the samples were contaminated with B. cereus (>1 log CFU/g) and 7 (6.8%) of the samples showed more than 3 log CFU/g. In total, 118 B. cereus isolates were examined for the virulence genes nheA, nheB, nheC, hblA, hblC, hblD, cytK, and entFM and for resistance to antibiotics. Of these B. cereus isolates, 70% harbored nheA, nheB, nheC, and cytK. Eighteen (80%) of 21 isolates from bell peppers possessed eight enterotoxin genes. B. cereus isolates were susceptible to imipenem, vancomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, whereas 22.4% of isolates from garlic chives, 48.7% from perilla leaf, and 40.5% from romaine lettuce showed antibiotic resistance to rifampin and 6% of isolates from garlic chives exhibited resistance to tetracycline. Three isolates from garlic chives were resistant to both tetracycline and rifampin. Raw vegetables were revealed to be major sources of B. cereus containing multiple toxin genes and exhibiting antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the potential health risks of consuming these vegetables raw or undercooked should not be underestimated. This study provides basic information for monitoring the antibiotic resistance and toxigenicity of B. cereus in the food chain during vegetable distribution and for developing food safety management to reduce the contamination with and transmission of B. cereus."
2006,17112808,Effect of grapefruit juice on cytochrome P450 2A6 and nicotine renal clearance.,"Grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme and transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion transporting polypeptides, leading to clinically important interactions. Our objective was to study the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine, which is primarily metabolized by the CYP2A6 enzyme.Ten volunteers were given a 2-mg oral dose of deuterium-labeled nicotine on 3 occasions together with 1 L of water, full-strength grapefruit juice, or half-strength grapefruit juice. Concentrations of nicotine and its metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine for 8 hours.Grapefruit juice inhibited the formation of cotinine from nicotine (area under the plasma cotinine concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 hours of 6807 min.ng/mL, 7805 min.ng/mL, and 8007 min.ng/mL for full-strength grapefruit juice, half-strength grapefruit juice, and water, respectively; repeated-measures ANOVA, P=.009). The time to peak plasma concentration of cotinine was delayed (216 minutes, 159 minutes, and 147 minutes, respectively; ANOVA, P=.011), and the peak plasma concentration was lower with grapefruit juice compared with water (18 ng/mL, 21 ng/mL, and 22 ng/mL, respectively; ANOVA, P=.010). Oral clearance, peak plasma concentration, and time to peak plasma concentration of nicotine were not affected. Grapefruit juice increased the renal clearance of nicotine (231 mL/min, 219 mL/min, and 123 mL/min, respectively; ANOVA, P=.045) and cotinine (19 mL/min, 14 mL/min, and 16 mL/min, respectively; ANOVA, P=.002).Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism of nicotine to cotinine, a pathway mediated by CYP2A6, and increases the renal clearance of nicotine and cotinine. Nicotine oral clearance is not affected by grapefruit juice because the inhibition of hepatic metabolism is offset by the increase in the renal clearance of nicotine. However, other compounds metabolized by CYP2A6, as well as other drugs excreted via renal clearance mechanisms similar to those of nicotine, may be susceptible to significant pharmacokinetic grapefruit juice interactions."
2005,15927936,Folic acid fortified milk increases blood folate and lowers homocysteine concentration in women of childbearing age.,"Daily consumption of 400 microg folic acid prior to conception and during early pregnancy is recommended for the prevention of neural tube defects (NTD). Strategies to increase folic acid consumption include supplements and fortified foods. Milk is consumed by women and can be fortified with folic acid but little is known about the effect of fortified milk on blood folate concentration in women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to determine whether daily consumption of milk fortified with 375 microg folic acid increases blood folate and lowers homocysteine concentrations in women of childbearing age. Seventy-three non-pregnant women (aged 18-47 y) were randomized to receive either 75 g/d of a fortified or unfortified (control) milk powder for 12 weeks. Women who consumed the folic acid fortified milk had mean (95% CI) red blood cell and plasma folate concentrations that were 539 nmol/L (436, 641) and 35 nmol/L (30, 41) higher, respectively, than in the control group. Women drinking fortified milk had a 14% lower mean plasma homocysteine concentration at week 12 than women consuming the control milk. Daily consumption of fortified milk powder providing 375 microg folic acid increases blood folate and lowers homocysteine concentrations over 12 weeks in women of childbearing age. Daily consumption of fortified milk would be expected to reduce NTD risk."
2005,16041136,Antioxidative and antihypertensive effects of Welsh onion on rats fed with a high-fat high-sucrose diet.,"The effects of Welsh onion on the development of hypertension and autoxidation were studied in 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were fed with a control diet or a high-fat high-sucrose (HFS) diet with or without 5% Welsh onion (green-leafy type or white-sheath type) for 4 weeks. The systolic blood pressure was elevated and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma were increased in the rats fed with the HFS diet without Welsh onion. The rats fed with the HFS diet containing Welsh onion, especially the green-leafy type, had lower blood pressure. They also had a higher level of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in both the urine and plasma, lower activity of NADH/NADPH oxidase in the aorta, and suppressed angiotensin II production. The effect of white Welsh onion on decreasing the blood pressure was not significant, although the effects on increasing NO metabolites in the urine and decreasing NADH oxidase activity in the aorta were significant. The TBARS value in the plasma was lowered in the rats fed with either green or white Welsh onion, but the in vitro radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative activities were much higher with green Welsh onion than with the white type. These results suggest that the green-leafy Welsh onion, but not the white type, reduced superoxide generation by suppressing the angiotensine II production and then the NADH/NADPH oxidase activity, increasing the NO availability in the aorta, and consequently lowering the blood pressure in the rats fed with the HFS diet. The radical scavenging and reducing antioxidative activities of green Welsh onion may also be effective in decreasing superoxide."
2008,18838800,"Structural determination and functional analysis of a soluble matrix protein associated with calcification of the exoskeleton of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii.","A novel matrix protein named calcification-associated soluble protein-2 (Casp-2) was isolated from the acetic acid-soluble fraction of the exoskeleton of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, and its primary structure was determined by a combination of peptide sequencing, mass spectral analysis, and cDNA cloning. Casp-2 consists of 117 amino acid residues and has a chitin-binding consensus sequence, the so-called Rebers-Riddiford (R-R) consensus sequence. Casp-2 exhibited an inhibitory activity on calcium carbonate precipitation from its supersaturated solution in vitro, suggesting association with calcification of the exoskeleton. Reverse transcription PCR and Northern blot analyses indicated that the Casp-2 gene was expressed only at the epidermis throughout the molting stages, and most strongly at the late pre-molt stage. Recombinant Casp-2 showed weak affinity to chitin in spite of having the R-R consensus sequence. These results indicate that Casp-2 interacts loosely with chitin fibrils and regulates calcification in the cuticle."
2007,17298705,"Influence of prebiotics and antioxidants in bread on the immune system, antioxidative status and antioxidative capacity in male smokers and non-smokers.","Interest in functional foods is increasing. The aim of the present study was to investigate breads supplemented with functional components. One was bread supplemented with inulin, linseed and soya fibre (prebiotic bread). The other was a prebiotic antioxidant bread (pre-aox-bread), which additionally contained green tea powder, herbs and tomato paste. The effects of these two breads on immunological and antioxidative parameters were compared with control bread (placebo). Twenty smokers and eighteen non-smokers were enrolled in the randomised parallel study, which consisted of a control period and an intervention period, each lasting for 5 weeks. Daily intake of bread and nutrients did not differ between the intervention and the control period. Most of the twenty-three investigated immunological parameters measured in peripheral blood were unaffected. However, the percentage of CD19 increased after intervention with prebiotic bread, whereas intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CD3+NK+ (P < 0.05) decreased in both intervention arms. The ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) was increased after consumption of the pre-aox-bread for non-smokers (1256 v. 1147 micromol/l; P = 0.019) and remained unchanged for smokers consuming the pre-aox-bread. All analysed carotenoids (P <or= 0.001) in plasma were increased after the consumption of pre-aox-bread. The concentrations of uric acid and alpha-tocopherol rose after intervention with both breads. ICAM-1 as a marker of stress decreased after consuming the prebiotic bread. In conclusion, increased plasma concentrations of carotenoids and the responses observed with the FRAP assay after intervention with the pre-aox-bread indicate a unique response in terms of antioxidative potentials for this type of functional food."
2005,16088341,"Anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and gastric effects of Hypericum perforatum in rats.","The pharmacological activity of Hypericum perforatum was assessed using models of inflammation, nociception, and gastric mucosal injury in rats. H. perforatum was given systemically as well as orally. When administered systemically, H. perforatum (50-300 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a dose-related and significant inhibition of the edematogenic response to s.p. injection of carrageenan. The percentages of maximal inhibition by the above doses were 53.7, 61.3, and 75.3%, respectively (compared to 90% after 50 mg/kg fluoxetine and 60.7% after 72 mg/kg etodolac). In tests of nociception, H. perforatum, administered orally, displayed antinociceptive activity in the tail electric stimulation and hot plate tests. The antinociceptive activity was observed with 25 mg/kg and a maximal increase in hot plate latency by 50% (compared to 73.2 and 77.8% increases by 5 or 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, respectively). In contrast, the acetic acid-induced (0.6%, i.p.) writhing was significantly reduced by fluoxetine or etodolac, but not H. perforatum. Also, the nociceptive response caused by i.p. injection of capsaicin (1.6 microg/paw) was unaffected by H. perforatum, but reduced by fluoxetine. Injection of H. perforatum (50, 125, or 250 mg/kg, s.c.) to pylorus-ligated rats, decreased gastric acid secretion, but increased indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal lesions dose dependently. These results demonstrate that H. perforatum exhibits antiedematogenic and antinociceptive properties, which may be of value for the management of inflammatory painful conditions. The agent, however, causes gastric irritation and may aggravate that of NSAIDs."
2005,16044456,Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia after single-agent treatment with fludarabine for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"A 70-year-old man with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received single-agent treatment with the purine analogue fludarabine, which led to complete remission. After 8 years, he presented with pancytopenia. Marrow examination showed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with trilineage myelodysplasia (MDS). Cytogenetic analysis showed an unbalanced der(1;7)(p10;q10) that resulted effectively in deletion 7q; confirming the diagnosis of therapy-related AML (t-AML). No residual CLL was present. Together with previous reports of secondary cancers after fludarabine treatment and the association of monosomy 7/7q- with another purine analogue azathioprine, results suggest that t-AML might develop after fludarabine therapy."
2009,18802672,"Maternal milk concentration of zinc, iron, selenium, and iodine and its relationship to dietary intakes.","The dietary intake of zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), selenium (Se), and iodine (I) of 31 lactating Mexican-American women attending the Hidalgo County WIC program in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas was estimated from 24-h dietary recall interviews. Milk samples were obtained from lactating mothers who had infants 3 months of age and younger. Milk samples were collected in two visits to assess change in breast milk composition after 1-3 months postpartum: group A--after 30-45 days and group B--75-90 days. Dietary intakes indicated that the study participants had significantly inadequate percent energy intakes than the DRI (Dietary Recommended Intakes) percent recommended kilocalorie values but protein intakes were substantially higher than the percent recommended values. The estimated percent Zn, Fe, Se, and I intakes were also significantly lower than the DRI percent recommended values. The lactating mothers consumed significantly less Zn, Se, and I when compared to the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) even though Fe intake was higher than the RDA value. Breast milk concentration of Zn, Fe, and Se were in agreement within the range of representative values for Constituents of Human Milk but I has significantly less concentration than the representative value. There was no statistically significant correlation observed between dietary intake and milk concentration of Zn, Fe, Se, and I. This study compares the estimated dietary intake of zinc, iron, selenium, and iodine to the concentration of these trace elements in the maternal milk of lactating women of Mexican-American heritage who attend the Rio Grande Valley WIC clinic."
2015,25391643,"Curcuma oil attenuates accelerated atherosclerosis and macrophage foam-cell formation by modulating genes involved in plaque stability, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.","In the present study, the anti-atherosclerotic effect and the underlying mechanism of curcuma oil (C. oil), a lipophilic fraction from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), was evaluated in a hamster model of accelerated atherosclerosis and in THP-1 macrophages. Male golden Syrian hamsters were subjected to partial carotid ligation (PCL) or FeCl3-induced arterial oxidative injury (Ox-injury) after 1 week of treatment with a high-cholesterol (HC) diet or HC diet plus C. oil (100 and 300 mg/kg, orally). Hamsters fed with the HC diet were analysed at 1, 3 and 5 weeks following carotid injury. The HC diet plus C. oil-fed group was analysed at 5 weeks. In hyperlipidaemic hamsters with PCL or Ox-injury, C. oil (300 mg/kg) reduced elevated plasma and aortic lipid levels, arterial macrophage accumulation, and stenosis when compared with those subjected to arterial injury alone. Similarly, elevated mRNA transcripts of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45), TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-1β and IL-6 were reduced in atherosclerotic arteries, while those of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL-10 were increased after the C. oil treatment (300 mg/kg). The treatment with C. oil prevented HC diet- and oxidised LDL (OxLDL)-induced lipid accumulation, decreased the mRNA expression of CD68 and CD36, and increased the mRNA expression of PPARα, LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in both hyperlipidaemic hamster-derived peritoneal and THP-1 macrophages. The administration of C. oil suppressed the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ and increased the expression of TGF-β in peritoneal macrophages. In THP-1 macrophages, C. oil supplementation prevented OxLDL-induced production of TNF-α and IL-1β and increased the levels of TGF-β. The present study shows that C. oil attenuates arterial injury-induced accelerated atherosclerosis, inflammation and macrophage foam-cell formation."
2008,18713456,Pharmacokinetic and metabolic effects of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in healthy volunteers receiving the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir.,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is prevalent among HIV-infected patients to reduce the toxicity of antiretroviral therapy. Ginseng has been used for treatment of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, a common side effect of some HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI). However, it is unknown whether American ginseng (AG) can reverse insulin resistance induced by the PI indinavir (IDV), and whether these two agents interact pharmacologically. We evaluated potential pharmacokinetic interactions between IDV and AG, and assessed whether AG improves IDV-induced insulin resistance.After baseline assessment of insulin sensitivity using the insulin clamp technique, healthy volunteers received IDV 800 mg q8 h for 3 days and then IDV and AG 1g q8h for 14 days. IDV pharmacokinetics and insulin sensitivity were assessed before and after AG co-administration.There was no difference in the area-under the plasma-concentration-time curve after the co-administration of AG, compared to IDV alone (n = 13). Although insulin-stimulated glucose disposal per unit of insulin (M/I) decreased by an average of 14.8 +/- 5.9% after 3 days of IDV (from 0.113 +/- 0.012 to 0.096 +/- 0.014 mg/kgFFM/min per muU/ml of insulin, p = 0.03, n = 11), M/I remained unchanged after co-administration of IDV and AG.IDV decreases insulin sensitivity, which is unaltered by AG co-administration. AG does not significantly affect IDV pharmacokinetics."
2018,29070527,Extracellular Vesicles Released by Cardiomyocytes in a Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiac Injury Mouse Model Contain Protein Biomarkers of Early Cardiac Injury.,"Purpose: Cardiac injury is a major cause of death in cancer survivors, and biomarkers for it are detectable only after tissue injury has occurred. Extracellular vesicles (EV) remove toxic biomolecules from tissues and can be detected in the blood. Here, we evaluate the potential of using circulating EVs as early diagnostic markers for long-term cardiac injury.Experimental Design: Using a mouse model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiac injury, we quantified serum EVs, analyzed proteomes, measured oxidized protein levels in serum EVs released after DOX treatment, and investigated the alteration of EV content.Results: Treatment with DOX caused a significant increase in circulating EVs (DOX_EV) compared with saline-treated controls. DOX_EVs exhibited a higher level of 4-hydroxynonenal adducted proteins, a lipid peroxidation product linked to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Proteomic profiling of DOX_EVs revealed the distinctive presence of brain/heart, muscle, and liver isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), and their origins were verified to be heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, respectively. The presence of brain/heart GP (PYGB) in DOX_EVs correlated with a reduction of PYGB in heart, but not brain tissues. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) overexpression, as well as pretreatment with cardioprotective agents and MnSOD mimetics, resulted in a reduction of EV-associated PYGB in mice treated with DOX. Kinetic studies indicated that EVs containing PYGB were released prior to the rise of cardiac troponin in the blood after DOX treatment, suggesting that PYGB is an early indicator of cardiac injury.Conclusions: EVs containing PYGB are an early and sensitive biomarker of cardiac injury.

2013,23542225,Reduced intensity conditioning is effective for hematopoietic SCT in dyskeratosis congenita-related BM failure.,"BM failure (BMF) is a major and frequent complication of dyskeratosis congenita (DKC). Allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) represents the only curative treatment for BMF associated with this condition. Transplant-related morbidity/mortality is common especially after myeloablative conditioning regimens. Herein, we report nine cases of patients with DKC who received an allo-SCT at five different member centers within the Eastern Mediterranean Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry. Between October 1992 and February 2011, nine DKC patients (male, 7 and female, 2), with a median age at transplantation of 19.1 (4.9-31.1) years, underwent an allo-HSCT from HLA-matched, morphologically normal-related donors (100%). Preparative regimens varied according to different centers, but was reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in eight patients. Graft source was unstimulated BM in five cases (56%) and G-CSF-mobilized PBSCs in four (44%) cases. The median stem cell dose was 6.79 (2.06-12.4) × 10(6) cells/kg body weight. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA in all nine cases; MTX or mycophenolate mofetil were added in five (56%) and two (22%) cases, respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin was administered at various doses and scheduled in four (44%) cases. Median time-to-neutrophil engraftment was 21 (17-27) days. In one case, late graft failure was noted at 10.4 months post allo-HSCT. Only one patient developed grade II acute GVHD (11%). Extensive chronic GVHD was reported in one case, whereas limited chronic GVHD occurred in another four cases. At a median follow-up of 61 (0.8-212) months, seven (78%) patients were still alive and transfusion independent. One patient died of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and graft failure was the cause of death in another patient. This study suggests that RIC preparative regimens are successful in inducing hematopoietic cell engraftment in patients with BMF from DKC. Owing to the limited sample size, the use of registry data and heterogeneity of preparative as well as GVHD prophylaxis regimens reported in this series, we are unable to recommend a particular regimen to be considered as the standard for patients with this disease.

2017,28950768,Induction of plant disease resistance upon treatment with yeast cell wall extract.,"It has been reported that treatment with yeast cell wall extract (YCWE) induces PDF1 and PR-1 gene expression; these transcripts are important markers of plant disease resistance, though the detailed signaling mechanisms that induce these defense responses are still unknown. In this report, we found that YCWE treatment triggered rice cell suspension cultures to accumulate phenylalanine (Phe), cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), 12-hydroxyjasmonoyle isoleucine (12OHJA-Ile), and azelaic acid (AzA). YCWE treatment also reduced endogenous triacylglycerol (TG) content. The addition of 13C-uniform-labeled oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids to the rice cell suspension cultures gave rise to 13C-uniform-labeled AzA. It was also found that YCWE treatment for Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in accumulations of OPDA, AzA, Phe, and camalexin together with enhanced resistance against Botrytis cinerea infection. This suggested that YCWE treatment upon plants may activate JA and AzA signaling systems to induce plant disease resistance."
1986,3954524,An outbreak of type 4b Listeria monocytogenes infection involving patients from eight Boston hospitals.,"During September and October 1979, 23 patients admitted to hospitals in the Boston area had systemic Listeria monocytogenes infection. Twenty (87%) of these isolates were L monocytogenes type 4b, whereas only nine (33%) of the isolates serotyped during the preceding 26 months had been 4b. Patients with type 4b Listeria infection during the epidemic period (case patients) differed from patients with sporadic Listeria infection in the preceding two years in that more of the case patients had hospital-acquired infection (15/20 vs 4/18), had received antacids or cimetidine before the onset of listeriosis (12/20 vs 3/18), and had gastrointestinal tract symptoms that began at the same time as fever (17/20 vs 4/18). In addition, more case patients took antacids or cimetidine compared with patients matched for age, sex, and date of hospitalization (12/20 vs 10/40). Three foods were preferred by case patients more frequently than by control patients: tuna fish, chicken salad, and cheese. However, the only common feature appeared to be the serving of these foods with raw celery, tomatoes, and lettuce. The raw vegetables may have been contaminated with Listeria, which was able to survive ingestion because of gastric acid neutralization and subsequently to cause enteritis, bacteremia, and meningitis in susceptible hosts. However, we cannot exclude pasteurized milk as a source of this outbreak."
2011,21584658,Magnesium supplementation through seaweed calcium extract rather than synthetic magnesium oxide improves femur bone mineral density and strength in ovariectomized rats.,"Commercially available seaweed calcium extract can supply high amounts of calcium as well as significant amounts of magnesium and other microminerals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the degree to which the high levels of magnesium in seaweed calcium extract affects the calcium balance and the bone status in ovariectomized rats in comparison to rats supplemented with calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide. A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley female rats (7 weeks) were divided into four groups and bred for 12 weeks: sham-operated group (Sham), ovariectomized group (OVX), ovariectomized with inorganic calcium and magnesium supplementation group (OVX-Mg), and ovariectomized with seaweed calcium and magnesium supplementation group (OVX-SCa). All experimental diets contained 0.5% calcium. The magnesium content in the experimental diet was 0.05% of the diet in the Sham and OVX groups and 0.1% of the diet in the OVX-Mg and OVX-SCa groups. In the calcium balance study, the OVX-Mg and OVX-SCa groups were not significantly different in calcium absorption compared to the OVX group. However, the femoral bone mineral density and strength of the OVX-SCa group were higher than those of the OVX-Mg and OVX groups. Seaweed calcium with magnesium supplementation or magnesium supplementation alone did not affect the serum ALP and CTx levels in ovariectomized rats. In summary, consumption of seaweed calcium extract or inorganic calcium carbonate with magnesium oxide demonstrated the same degree of intestinal calcium absorption, but only the consumption of seaweed calcium extract resulted in increased femoral bone mineral density and strength in ovariectomized rats. Our results suggest that seaweed calcium extract is an effective calcium and magnesium source for improving bone health compared to synthetic calcium and magnesium supplementation."
2011,21294856,"Eriobotrya japonica hydrophilic extract modulates cytokines in normal tissues, in the tumor of Meth-A-fibrosarcoma bearing mice, and enhances their survival time.","Cytokines play a key role in the immune response to developing tumors, and therefore modulating their levels and actions provides innovative strategies for enhancing the activity of antigen presenting cells and polarizing towards T helper 1 type response within tumor microenvironment. One of these approaches could be the employment of plant extracts that have cytokine immunomodulation capabilities. Previously, we have shown that the Eriobotrya japonica hydrophilic extract (EJHE) induces proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo.The present study explored the in vivo immunomodulatory effect on interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) evoked by two water-extracts prepared from EJ leaves in the tissues of normal and Meth-A-fibrosarcoma bearing mice.Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 μg of EJHE and EJHE-water residue (WR), prepared from butanol extraction, increased significantly IFN-γ production in the spleen (p < 0.01) and lung (p < 0.03) tissues at 6-48 hours and suppressed significantly TGF-β1 production levels (p < 0.001) in the spleen for as long as 48 hours. The latter responses, however, were not seen in Meth-A fibrosarcoma-bearing mice. On the contrary, triple i.p. injections, 24 hours apart; of 10 μg EJHE increased significantly IFN-γ production in the spleen (p < 0.02) while only EJHE-WR increased significantly IFN-γ, TGF-β1 and IL-17 (p < 0.03 - 0.005) production within the tumor microenvironment of Meth-A fibrosarcoma. In addition, the present work revealed a significant prolongation of survival time (median survival time 72 days vs. 27 days of control, p < 0.007) of mice inoculated i.p. with Meth-A cells followed by three times/week for eight weeks of i.p. administration of EJHE-WR. The latter prolonged survival effect was not seen with EJHE.The therapeutic value of EJHE-WR as an anticancer agent merits further investigation of understanding the effect of immunomodulators' constituents on the cellular components of the tissue microenvironment. This can lead to the development of improved strategies for cancer treatment and thus opening up a new frontier for future studies."
1995,8575037,Synthetic nucleosides and nucleotides. XXXV. Synthesis and biological evaluations of 5-fluoropyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides of 3-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranose and related compounds.,"1-O-Acetyl-2,5-di-O-p-chlorobenzoyl-3-deoxy-D-ribofuranose (1), derived from the antibiotic cordycepin was coupled with trimethylsilylated derivatives (2a-c) of N4-propionylcytosine, N4-p-toluoyl-5-fluorocytosine and 5-fluorouracil in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMS-triflate) to give fully acylated nucleosides (3a-b and 3d, respectively). Selective removal of the N4-propionyl group of 3a by treatment with hydrazine hydrate gave 2',5'-di-O-p-chlorobenzoyl-3'-deoxycytidine (4). Deamination of 4 with sodium nitrite in trifluoroacetic acid afforded 2',5'-di-O-p-chlorobenzoyluridine (3c) in good yield. Compounds 3a-d were saponified to give free 3'-deoxycytidine (5a), 5-fluoro-3'-deoxycytidine (5b), 3'-deoxyuridine (5c), and 5-fluoro-3'-deoxyuridine (5d), respectively. These 3'-deoxyribonucleosides (5a-d) were then converted to corresponding 5'-monophosphate and further phosphorylated to the 5'-triphosphates by the phosphoroimidazolidate method. The nucleosides (5a-d) were examined for growth-inhibitory effects on mouse leukemic L5178Y cells, and their IC50 values (microgram/ml) were 1.8, 33, 6.5, and 18, respectively. On the other hand, the antiviral activities of these compounds on a rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), were moderate (IC50 = 100-500 micrograms/ml in CHSE-214 cells). The 5'-triphosphates showed remarkable inhibitory effects on DNA polymerase beta and DNA polymerase alpha-primase purified from testes of the cherry salmon, Oncorhynchus masou, but not on common DNA polymerase alpha from same source."
2018,29536560,Haploidentical transplantation outcomes for secondary acute myeloid leukemia: Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) study.,"Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) traditionally has inferior outcomes compared to de novo AML. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the sole potentially curative therapy. This study analyzes the outcomes for unmanipulated haploidentical HCT (haploHCT) for sAML using the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) registry of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). We identified 154 patients with sAML who underwent haploHCT from 2006 to 2016. Median age at HCT was 60 years with time from diagnosis to HCT 5 months. At transplantation, 69 patients were in first CR and 85 had active disease. Fifty-seven (38.0%) patients underwent myeloablative conditioning and 97 (62.0%) reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) conditioning. Multivariate analysis showed that there was no difference in RI, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), leukemia free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), or GVHD-free/relapse free survival (GRFS) for conditioning intensity, age, performance status, or graft source. Active disease was associated with higher RI and inferior LFS, OS, and GRFS compared with patients in CR at time of transplant. T-cell depletion with anti-thymoglobulin resulted in higher NRM and inferior LFS, OS, and GRFS compared to post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) (HR 2.25, 2.01, 2.16, and 1.73, respectively with P values <.05). Our data shows that haploHCT is a feasible alternative for sAML when matched transplantation is unavailable."
2019,30309522,Particulate organohalogens in edible brown seaweeds.,"Brown algae, rich in antioxidants and other bioactive compounds, are important dietary seaweeds in many cultures. Like other marine macroalgae, brown seaweeds are known to accumulate the halogens iodine and bromine. Comparatively little is known about the chemistry of chlorine in seaweeds. We used synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to measure total non-volatile organochlorine and -bromine in five edible brown seaweeds: Laminaria digitata, Fucus vesiculosus, Pelvetia canaliculata, Saccharina latissima, and Undaria pinnatifida. Organochlorine concentrations range from 120 to 630 mg·kg-1 dry weight and organobromine from 150 to 360 mg·kg-1, comprising mainly aromatic organohalogens in both cases. Aliphatic organochlorine exceeds aliphatic organobromine but is positively correlated with it among the seaweeds. Higher organochlorine levels appear in samples with more lipid moieties, suggesting lipid chlorination as a possible formation pathway. Particulate organohalogens are not correlated with antioxidant activity or polyphenolic content in seaweed extracts. Such compounds likely contribute to organohalogen body burden in humans and other organisms."
2019,31533701,Efficacy evaluation of ethanolic extract of Tamarindus indica L. leaves as possible alternate therapy in septic arthritis model of rabbit.,"Our previous study exhibited free radicals scavenging and antioxidant activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Tamarindus indica L. leaves in chronic sodium fluoride poisoning in rats. Tamarindus indica L. seed extract was also reported to have anti-arthritic efficacy by inhibiting cartilage and bone degrading factors. Therefore, an attempt was made to evaluate the effects of ethanolic extract of Tamarindus indica L. leaves in septic arthritis.The safety study was performed by oral dosing of ethanolic extract of the plant leaves at 2 g kg- 1 for consecutive 28 days in rabbits. Septic arthritis was induced in rabbits by single intra-articular inoculation of 104 c.f.u. of Staphylococcus aureus to the left stifle joint and was monitored by bacterial colony count, some relevant biochemical parameters and histopathological interpretation of the affected joint. For efficacy evaluation in septic arthritis, linezolid at 75 mg kg- 1 twice daily for 10 days and the ethanolic extract of Tamarindus indica L. at 500 and 1000 mg kg- 1 for consecutive 14 days were administered orally to the rabbits after 48 h of induction of arthritis.In sub-acute toxicity study of Tamarindus indica L. leaves ethanolic extract, no significant change between days was found for aspertate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine compared to day 0 values of the same group. The bacterial colony count of synovial fluid following Staphylococcus aureus inoculation to left stifle joint was found to be 1.08 ± 0.47 and 1.19 ± 0.29 c.f.u. mL- 1 in ethanolic extract low dose and high dose groups respectively, on day 2 which was reduced to 0.057 ± 0.036 c.f.u. mL- 1 and nil on day 16. The test extract was also found to markedly reduce simultaneous glucose difference, total protein ratio of serum and synovial fluid, joint radius and joint narrowing.Ethanolic extract of Tamarindus indica L. leaves at 500 mg kg- 1 and 1000 mg kg- 1 produced anti-arthritic effects against S. aureus induced septic arthritis in rabbits. However, the ethanolic extract at 1000 mg kg- 1 orally for consecutive 14 days showed better effects in septic arthritis."
2012,22184404,"A phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of elotuzumab in patients with advanced multiple myeloma.","This multicenter, first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab. A standard 3 + 3 design was used to determine maximum tolerated dose; dose-limiting toxicities were assessed during cycle 1. Thirty-five patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma were treated with intravenous elotuzumab at doses ranging from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients who achieved at least stable disease after 4 treatments could receive another 4 treatments. No maximum tolerated dose was identified up to the maximum planned dose of 20 mg/kg. The most common adverse events, regardless of attribution, were cough, headache, back pain, fever, and chills. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and adverse events attributed to study medication were primarily infusion-related. Plasma elotuzumab levels and terminal half-life increased with dose whereas clearance decreased, suggesting target-mediated clearance. CS1 on bone marrow-derived plasma cells was reliably saturated (≥ 95%) at the 10-mg/kg and 20-mg/kg dose levels. Using the European Group for Bone and Marrow Transplantation myeloma response criteria, 9 patients (26.5%) had stable disease. In summary, elotuzumab was generally well tolerated in this population, justifying further exploration of this agent in combination regimens."
2018,29655733,Particulate nanocomposite from oyster (Crassostrea rivularis) hydrolysates via zinc chelation improves zinc solubility and peptide activity.,"An oyster protein hydrolysates-zinc complex (OPH-Zn) was prepared and investigated to improve zinc bioaccessibility. Zinc ions chelating with oyster protein hydrolysates (OPH) cause intramolecular and intermolecular folding and aggregation, homogeneously forming the OPH-Zn complex as nanoclusters with a Z-average at 89.28 nm (PDI: 0.16 ± 0.02). The primary sites of zinc-binding in OPH were carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, and amino groups, and they were related to the high number of charged amino acid residues. Furthermore, formation of the OPH-Zn complex could significantly enhance zinc solubility both under specific pH conditions as well as during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, compared to the commonly used ZnSO4. Additionally, after digestion, either preserved or enhanced antioxidant activity of OPH was found when chelated with zinc. These results indicated that the OPH-Zn complex could be a potential functional ingredient with improved antioxidant bioactivity and zinc bioaccessibility."
2016,27457362,Anthelmintic activity of silver-extract nanoparticles synthesized from the combination of silver nanoparticles and M. charantia fruit extract.,"Present study has been conducted to know the anthelmintic activity of polyaniline coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from Momordica charantia fruit extract.By reduction of AgNO3 in presence of NaBH4, silver nanoparticles were prepared. After mixing silver nanoparticles and extracts, coating was given on nanoparticles using polyaniline. Prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Visual, UV, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM techniques, and TEM analysis.The FTIR results implied that AgNPs were successfully synthesized and capped with bio-compounds present in the extract. The result showed that death times of worm were 35.12 ± 0.5 and 59.3 ± 0.3 minutes for M. charantia extract and Ag-nanoparticles individually. But when these two combined together, paralysis and death time fall drastically which were only 6.16 ± 0.6 and 9.1 ± 0.4 minutes respectively. Albendazole tablet was used as standard, which made worms death in 3.66 ± 0.1 minutes.Ag-Extract NPs showed strong anthelmintic activity against worm. This study has paved the way for further research to design new anthelmintic drug from the combination of M. charantia and AgNPs."
2006,16427181,Effect of in vivo phenol or hydroquinone exposure on events related to neutrophil delivery during an inflammatory response.,"Phenol (PHE) and hydroquinone (HQ) are metabolites of benzene that affect leukocytes after solvent intoxication. Hence, we investigated the effects of PHE or HQ exposure on neutrophil mobilization during an inflammatory response. Male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of PHE, HQ or vehicle only and assays were performed 24 h after the last dose. Quantifications of bone marrow or circulating leukocytes showed that only HQ exposure induced neutrophilia, probably due to the accelerated mobilization from the bone marrow compartment, since reduced numbers of segmented cells in the last phase of maturation were detected there. Intravital microscopy showed that circulating leukocytes of HQ-exposed rats increased their rolling behavior and adherence to the mesenteric postcapillary venule wall in vivo. The enhanced leukocyte-endothelium interaction was not dependent on microvascular reactivity or perivascular mast cell degranulation. Instead, it was the result of neutrophil activation, demonstrated by a decrease in L-selectin and an increase in beta2 integrin expression on neutrophil membranes. This pattern of neutrophil activation may have contributed to the higher number of neutrophils in the subcutaneous inflammatory response of HQ-exposed rats after oyster glycogen injection. Taken together, our results indicate that HQ exposure alters neutrophil mobilization, which results in an exacerbated response after an injury. Although PHE is endogenously metabolized to HQ, PHE exposure only induced an increment in rolling behavior, which was not sufficient to alter the inflammatory response."
2011,23140694,Indigenous proteases in the skin of unicorn leatherjacket (Alutherus monoceros) and their influence on characteristic and functional properties of gelatin.,"Indigenous proteases in the skin of unicorn leatherjacket (Alutherus monoceros) were characterised using autolytic study. Maximised autolysis was found at pH 7 and 50°C. Autolysis was markedly inhibited by 0.04mM soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), suggesting that heat activated serine protease was predominant in the skin. The impact of indigenous proteases on the properties of gelatin extracted from unicorn leatherjacket skin was investigated. Gelatin was extracted from unicorn leatherjacket skin using distilled water at 50°C for 12h in the presence and absence of 0.04mM SBTI. In the presence of SBTI, the degradation was markedly inhibited, but a lower gelatin extraction yield was obtained (P<0.05). Extracted gelatins contained α(1) and α(2) chains as the predominant components with some degradation peptides. FTIR spectra indicated a greater loss of molecular order of the triple helix and a higher degradation was found in gelatin extracted in the absence of 0.04mM SBTI. The net charge of gelatin samples extracted with and without 0.04mM SBTI became zero at pHs of 8.45 and 7.31, respectively, as determined by ζ-potential titration. Higher gel strength (320.68±3.02g) was obtained in gelatin extracted with SBTI, compared with that of gelatin extracted without SBTI (288.63±1.44g). High emulsifying activity index but lower emulsifying stability index was observed in the former. Therefore, heat-activated serine protease was involved in the degradation of gelatin molecules, thereby affecting the yield, proteinaceous components and properties of gelatin from unicorn leatherjacket skin."
2018,29739588,"Chemical composition, antifungal activity and potential anti-virulence evaluation of the Eugenia uniflora essential oil against Candida spp.","The development of fungal resistance to antifungal drugs has been worsening over the years and as a result research on new antifungal agents derived from plants has intensified. Eugenia uniflora L. (pitanga) has been studied for its various biological actions. In this study the chemical composition and antifungal effects of the E. uniflora essential oil (EULEO) were investigated against Candida albicans (CA), Candida krusei (CK) and Candida tropicalis (CT) standard strains. The essential oil obtained through hydro-distillation was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To determine the IC50 of the oil, the cellular viability curve and the inhibitory effects were measured by means of the oil's association with Fluconazole in a broth microdilution assay with spectrophotometric readings. The Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) was determined by solid medium subculture with the aid of a guide plate while the assays used to verify morphological changes emerging from the action of the fractions were performed in microculture chambers at concentrations based on the microdilution. Two major oil constituents stand out from the chemical analysis: selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (36.37%) and selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one epoxide (27.32%). The concentration that reduced microorganismal growth was ≥8,192 μg/mL while the IC50 varied, this being between 1892.47 and 12491.80 μg/mL (oil), 10.07 - 80.78 μg/mL (fluconazole) and 18.53 - 295.60 μg/mL (fluconazole + oil). The combined activity (fluconazole + oil) resulted in indifference and antagonism. A MFC of the oil in association with fluconazole was recorded at the concentration of 8,192 μg/mL against CA and CK. The oil caused the inhibition of CA and CT morphological transition. In view of the results obtained, additional research is needed to elucidate the activity of the E. uniflora oil over genetic and biochemical processes regarding its effect on Candida spp. virulence."
2011,22039263,"Engineering pro-angiogenic peptides using stable, disulfide-rich cyclic scaffolds.","Fragments from the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and osteopontin and a sequence from VEGF have potent proangiogenic activity despite their small size (< 10 residues). However, these linear peptides have limited potential as drug candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis because of their poor stability. In the present study, we show that the therapeutic potential of these peptides can be significantly improved by ""grafting"" them into cyclic peptide scaffolds. Momordica cochinchinensis trypsin inhibitor-II (MCoTI-II) and sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 (SFTI-1), naturally occurring, plant-derived cyclic peptides of 34 and 14 residues, respectively, were used as scaffolds in this study. Using this approach, we have designed a peptide that, in contrast to the small peptide fragments, is stable in human serum and at nanomolar concentration induces angiogenesis in vivo. This is the first report of using these scaffolds to improve the activity and stability of angiogenic peptide sequences and is a promising approach for promoting angiogenesis for therapeutic uses."
2016,27721178,Foeniculum vulgare Mill. increases cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry in vascular endothelial cells.,"This study assessed the effects of essential oil of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel oil) and of trans-anethole, the main component of fennel oil, on extracellular Ca2+-induced store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) into vascular endothelial (EA) cells and their mechanisms of action. Components of fennel oil were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) in EA cells was determined using Fura-2 fluorescence. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, fennel oil significantly increased [Ca2+]c in EA cells; this increase was significantly inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blockers La3+ and nifedipine. In contrast, fennel oil induced [Ca2+]c was significantly lower in Ca2+-free solution, suggesting that fennel oil increases [Ca2+]c mainly by enhancing Ca2+ influx into EA cells. [Ca2+]c mobilization by trans-anethole was similar to that of fennel oil. Moreover, SOCE was suppressed by fennel oil and trans-anethole. SOCE was also attenuated by lanthanum (La3+), a non-selective cation channel (NSC) blocker; 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB), an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor and SOCE blocker; and U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC). Further, SOCE was more strongly inhibited by La3+ plus fennel oil or trans-anethole than by La3+ alone. These findings suggest that fennel oil and trans-anethole significantly inhibit SOCE-induced [Ca2+]c increase in vascular endothelial cells and that these reactions may be mediated by NSC, IP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, and PLC activation."
2009,19252301,Synergistic effect of kaempferol glycosides purified from Laurus nobilis and fluoroquinolones on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"In a previous study, we reported that two kaempferol glycosides isolated from Laurus nobilis L., kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2'',4''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C2) and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl-4''-Z-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C3), showed strong antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Thereafter we found that these compounds greatly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of some fluoroquinolones in MRSA. In other words, C2 and C3 greatly potentiated anti-MRSA activity of fluoroquinolones. The effect of C2 and C3 with fluoroquinolones was found to be synergistic. The potentiation activity was observed with hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, such as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not with hydrophobic quinolones. We also found that norfloxacin reduced MICs of C2 and C3. The effect was synergistic. Possible mechanism of the synergistic effect was discussed."
2008,18239280,"Antinociceptive effects of St. John's wort, Harpagophytum procumbens extract and Grape seed proanthocyanidins extract in mice.","Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort, SJW), Harpagophytum procumbens extract (HPE) and Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) have a broad spectrum of biological activities including antidepressant, anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant effects. The aim of this study was to clarify antinociceptive properties of SJW, HPE and GSPE in mice with mechanisms that might potentially underlie these activities. Also, the effects of these herbal extracts on the antinociception and plasma and brain concentrations of morphine were examined. Oral pretreatment with SJW (100-1000 mg/kg) and HPE (30-300 mg/kg) attenuated significantly times of licking/biting both first and second phases of formalin injection in mice in the dose-dependent manner, and GSPE (10-300 mg/kg) suppressed second phase. Naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated antinociceptive effect of HPE but not SJW and GSPE. Formalin injection resulted in significant increase in the content of nitrites/nitrates (NO(x)) in mouse spinal cord. The rise of spinal NO(x) content by formalin was significantly attenuated by HPE and SJW. The pretreatment with SJW significantly potentiated an antinociceptive effect of morphine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), although concentrations of morphine in plasma and brain were not significantly changed by these herbal extracts. In conclusion, the present study has shown that SJW, HPE and GSPE exert significant antinociceptive effects in the formalin test of mice. In addition, opioidergic system seems to be involved in the antinociceptive effect of HPE but not SJW and GSPE. Furthermore, SJW potentiates morphine-induced antinociception possibly by pharmacodynamic interaction."
2014,24678980,"Medicinal attributes of Solanum xanthocarpum fruit consumed by several tribal communities as food: an in vitro antioxidant, anticancer and anti HIV perspective.","Solanum xanthocarpum (Solanaceae) has been used for treatment of many infectious and degenerative diseases in traditional medicine. Present study reports the medicinal efficacy of S. xanthocarpum fruit as antioxidant, anticancer and anti HIV agents.Extracts were prepared using Soxhlet apparatus and partially characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Total flavonoid content was determined spectrophotometrically. Reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays were used for measurement of antioxidant potential. Cytotoxic (SRB assay) and anti-HIV RT inhibition (RT assay kit, Roche) activities were determined using ELISA.TLC revealed the diversity of phytoconstituents in various sequential extracts of S. xanthocarpum fruit. Total flavonoid contents in extracts ranged between 10.22-162.49 μg quercetin equivalent/mg. Spectroscopic scanning of water soluble phenolics showed maximum absorbance at 250 and 280 nm. Polar extracts displayed potent radical scavenging activity (>80%). Several sub-fractions (spots) of extracts separated on TLC plates also exhibited powerful radical scavenging activity. Considerable reducing power was observed in extracts. Hexane fraction provided 55% lipoprotection in rat kidney homogenate. Non-polar extracts exhibited appreciable cytotoxic activity (70-91%) against leukemia (THP-1) and lung cancer (HOP-62) cell lines. Lower inhibitory activity was observed in extracts against HIV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme.The study demonstrated considerable antioxidant and anticancer activities in S. xanthocarpum fruit."
2005,16215873,"MnSOD Val-9Ala genotype, pro- and anti-oxidant environmental modifiers, and breast cancer among women on Long Island, New York.","Excessive oxidative stress may induce and promote breast carcinogenesis. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is critical to management of oxidative stress by catalyzing the formation of hydrogen peroxide from two superoxide anions. To examine the relationship between MnSOD Val-9Ala polymorphism, breast cancer and potential modifiers, we analyzed data from a large population-based case-control study. Study participants completed an in-home interviewer-administered questionnaire, and self-completed a Block food frequency questionnaire. Age-adjusted unconditional logistic models included 1034 cases and 1084 controls. As compared with Val/Val genotype, we found no association between MnSOD Ala/Val (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.79-1.21) and Ala/Ala (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.79-1.28) genotypes and breast cancer. Results did not differ by menopausal status, stage of tumor, or estrogen and progesterone receptor status. No discernable patterns of interaction were found between this MnSOD variant and anti-oxidative exposures, including fruit and vegetable intake or NSAID use, or pro-oxidant exposures, including smoking and alcohol. This study provides little evidence that variation in Val-9Ala polymorphism of MnSOD alone or through substantial interaction with key exposures believed to be pro- or anti-oxidant properties influences breast cancer risk."
2012,22411046,Oxidative damage and antioxidant response of Allium cepa meristematic and elongation cells exposed to metronidazole.,"The toxicity of metronidazole (MTZ) in meristematic and elongation zones of Allium cepa roots was analyzed for 30 h of exposition. Toxic effects were evaluated by lipid peroxidation (content of thiobarbituric-reactive substances [TBARS]), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, ascorbate acid and dehydroascorbate acid content, and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. The root zones showed differentiated susceptibility to MTZ. In the elongation zone, MTZ induced an increase of TBARS content and a significant rise in GSH levels, whereas in the meristematic zone, lipid peroxidation was not observed and all antioxidant defense parameters analyzed were significantly increased. These results indicate that MTZ exposure induced oxidative stress in A. cepa roots, and that the antioxidant defenses in the meristematic zone are more efficient compared with the elongation zone, which is probably related to higher oxidative metabolism of meristematic tissue."
1992,1575899,[Dispersion of ragweed in the Drome-Ardèche region].,"Over the last ten years Ambrosia has spread considerably in the middle Rhône area; this is especially true of the Drôme, along the river Rhône, but also in remote, very sheltered localities to the East and South-East of the province. Rural areas are not spared (grain crops, peach orchards). The Ardèche is also being invaded from North to South, and further to the West, Ambrosia is starting to besiege the mountains, up to an altitude of around 2,900 feet, despite its reputation of only growing in the plains. The 1990 season was an especially difficult one, of very great intensity, and did not respond to the usual therapy (desensitization, antihistamine drugs at the maximum dose, even cortisone derivatives). A record pollen density was registered on P. Cour's pollen counter at Lyon-Bron in early September: 340 grains per square meter of air. The curative and preventative treatment of this pollinosis remains problematic and deserves a consensus."
2011,21827045,"Simultaneous determination of liensinine, isoliensinine and neferine from seed embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. in rat plasma by a rapid HPLC method and its application to a pharmacokinetic study.","A rapid and specific HPLC method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of liensinine (CAS 2586-96-1), isoliensinine (CAS 6817-41-0) and neferine (CAS 2292-16-2) in rat plasma. The sample was prepared by a liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether and the recovery was above 80% from the plasma for the three compounds. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a Hypersil BDS C18 column (4.0 mm x 250 mm, particle size 5 microm). A mobile phase consisting of methanol: 0.2 M KH2PO4:0.2 M NaOH:triethylamine (71:17:12:0.002, v/v/v/v, pH 9.2-9.3) was slowly delivered at 0.8 ml/min in isocratic mode with a detection wavelength of 282 nm. The linearity of calibration curves were good (r > 0.999) in the concentration range of 0.031-2.00 microg/ ml. The lower limit of quantification can reach 0.03 microg/ml for the three compounds. The intra-day and inter-day variations estimated with QC samples were less than 8% for the three tested concentration levels. This developed method was applied in the plasma pharmacokinetic study of total bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (TAL) of the lotus flower (Lian Zi Xin) following a single oral and intravenous administration of TAL in rats."
1997,9094756,Hydrolysis of big endothelin-1 by a serine protease in the membrane fraction of human lung.,"The hydrolysis of human big endothelin 1-38 (bigET-1) was investigated in the membrane fractions from three human lung specimens. The hydrolysis products were identified by HPLC or by amino acid analysis, peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry, and the contractile effects of synthetic bigET-1, synthetic ET-1 and the major metabolite were tested on isolated rabbit pulmonary arteries. The dominating hydrolysis product was identified as bigET1-31, formed by a chymostatin-sensitive enzyme. Soybean trypsin inhibitor also suppressed bigET1-31 formation, while two other serine protease inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and aprotinin, had no (or a limited) inhibitory effect. Through a partly phosphoramidon-sensitive enzymatic activity, endothelin-1 (ET-1) was formed independently of bigET1-31. On isolated pulmonary arteries, bigET1-31 had a contractile effect similar to that of synthetic bigET-1, with pEC50% values of 7.3 +/- 0.1 (n = 6) and 7.1 +/- 0.1 (n = 8), respectively. The pEC50% value of ET-1 was 9.2 +/- 0.3 (n = 6). These results indicate that human pulmonary membranes, besides hydrolysing bigET-1 to ET-1, also express serine protease activity that is responsible for the formation of the biologically active product, bigET1-31."
2005,15667596,Effect of sodium azulene sulfonate on capsaicin-induced pharyngitis in rats.,"Sodium azulene sulfonate is a water-soluble derivative of azulene which is an antiinflammatory component of chamomile of the family of Asteraceae. Sodium azulene sulfonate is clinically used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of pharyngitis as well as other inflammatory diseases such as tonsillitis, stomatitis and conjunctivitis. There has been no documentation on the effect of sodium azulene sulfonate on pharyngitis in laboratory models, probably because of no availability of such models. We recently established a pharyngitis model using capsaicin application on pharyngeal mucosa in rats. The present study investigated the antipharyngitis activity of sodium azulene sulfonate comparing with those of ruthenium red (vanilloid receptor antagonist, 8.5 and 85 mg/ml), ascorbic acid (antioxidative compound, 100 microg/ml), povidone iodine (gargle as disinfectant, oxidative compound, 5 and 20 mg/ml) and diclofenac sodium (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml). As an antipharyngeal effect, the capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa of the rat was evaluated. The capsaicin-induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa was inhibited by sodium azulene sulfonate (100 and 200 microg/ml) as well as ruthenium red and ascorbic acid, but not by povidone iodine and dicrofenac sodium; povidone iodine rather promoted the plasma exudation. In conclusion, the antipharyngitis effect of sodium azulene sulfonate was demonstrated for the first time in a laboratory model. Although the mechanism by which sodium azulene sulfonate inhibited the capsaicin-induced pharyngitis is not yet unraveled, antioxidative effect, but not inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase pathway, might be involved."
2017,27631328,Estimation of Mineral and Trace Element Profile in Bubaline Milk Affected with Subclinical Mastitis.,"The milk samples from buffaloes of Murrah breed at mid lactation stage, reared at an organised dairy farm, were screened for subclinical mastitis based on bacteriological examination and somatic cell count following International Dairy Federation criteria. Milk samples from subclinical mastitis infected and healthy buffaloes were analysed to evaluate physicochemical alterations in terms of protein, fat, pH, electrical conductivity, chloride, minerals (sodium, potassium and calcium) and trace elements (iron, zinc, copper and selenium). In the present study, protein, fat, zinc, iron, calcium and selenium content was significantly lower (P < 0.001), while pH and electrical conductivity were significantly higher in mastitic milk as compared to normal milk. Concentration of electrolytes mainly sodium and chloride significantly increased with higher somatic cell count in mastitic milk and to maintain osmolality; potassium levels decreased proportionately. Correlation matrix revealed significantly positive interdependences of somatic cell count with pH, electrical conductivity, sodium and chloride. However, protein, fat, calcium and potassium were correlated negatively with elevated somatic cell count in mastitic milk. It is concluded that udder infections resulting in elevated somatic cells may alter the mineral and trace element profile of milk, and magnitude of changes may have diagnostic and prognostic value."
2015,25442538,Magnetic stirrer induced dispersive ionic-liquid microextraction for the determination of vanadium in water and food samples prior to graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry.,"A new dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, magnetic stirrer induced dispersive ionic-liquid microextraction (MS-IL-DLLME) was developed to quantify the trace level of vanadium in real water and food samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). In this extraction method magnetic stirrer was applied to obtained a dispersive medium of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [C4MIM][PF6] in aqueous solution of (real water samples and digested food samples) to increase phase transfer ratio, which significantly enhance the recovery of vanadium - 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) chelate. Variables having vital role on desired microextraction methods were optimised to obtain the maximum recovery of study analyte. Under the optimised experimental variables, enhancement factor (EF) and limit of detection (LOD) were achieved to be 125 and 18 ng L(-1), respectively. Validity and accuracy of the desired method was checked by analysis of certified reference materials (SLRS-4 Riverine water and NIST SRM 1515 Apple leaves). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 10 replicate determinations at 0.5 μg L(-1) of vanadium level was found to be <5.0%. This method was successfully applied to real water and acid digested food samples."
2008,17482221,"Ethnoveterinary study for antidermatophytic activity of Piper betle, Alpinia galanga and Allium ascalonicum extracts in vitro.","Crude ethanolic extracts of Piper betle leaves (Piperaceae), Alpinia galanga rhizomes (Zingiberaceae) and Allium ascalonicum bulbs (Liliaceae) were tested against selected zoonotic dermatophytes (Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophyte) and the yeast-like Candida albicans. A broth dilution method was employed to determine the inhibitory effect of the extracts and compared to those of ketoconazole and griseofulvin. All extracts suppressed the growth of the fungi in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the extracts tested, P. betle exhibited more effective antifungal properties with average IC(50) values ranging from 110.44 to 119.00 microg/ml. Subsequently, 10% Piper betle (Pb) cream was formulated, subjected to physical and microbial limit test and evaluated for antifungal effect. The disc diffusion assay revealed comparable zones of inhibition between discs of Pb cream containing 80 microg P. betle extract and 80 microg ketoconazole against tested fungi at 96 h after incubation. Thereafter, the inhibitory effect of Pb cream markedly decreased and completely lost effectiveness by day 7. In summary, the results supported the traditional wisdom of herbal remedy use and suggested a potential value-addition to agricultural products. It was suggested that the Pb cream has potential therapeutic value for treatment of dermatophytosis. However, clinical testing as well as improving the Pb cream formulation with greater efficacy and duration of action would be of interest and awaits further investigation."
,17851335,Back to basics: finding an optimal cerumenolytic (earwax solvent).,"An in vitro study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the commonly used aqueous and organic cerumenolytic (earwax solvent). Three agents were included in the study: olive oil, sodium bicarbonate and urea-hydrogen peroxide complex 5% in glycerol. Distilled water was used as a control. The disintegration of preformed wax plug was noted at specific intervals. The test tube containing distilled water as a control was found to be most effective and fastest in completely disintegrating the wax. This was closely followed by sodium bicarbonate. In contrast, the organic products, namely urea-hydrogen peroxide complex 5% in glycerol showed very little cerumenolytic effect. Olive oil, the most commonly used solution, was ineffective in disintegrating the wax plug even after 24 hours. The study shows aqueous cerumenolytics are more effective than organic agents."
2008,18707137,Dual actions involved in arsenite-induced oxidative DNA damage.,"Arsenic is a recognized human carcinogen, but the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not well understood. Oxidative stress and inhibition of DNA damage repair have been postulated as potential carcinogenic actions of arsenic. The present study tests the hypothesis that arsenite not only induces oxidative stress but also inhibits the activity of the DNA base excision repair protein, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), leading to exacerbation of the oxidative DNA damage induced by arsenic. HaCat cells were treated with arsenite for 24 h before measuring 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), PARP-1 activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Zinc supplementation and PARP-1 siRNA were used to increase or decrease, respectively, the PARP-1 protein's physiological function. At high concentrations (10 microM or higher), arsenite greatly induced oxidative DNA damage, as indicated by 8-OHdG formation. At lower concentrations (1 microM), arsenite did not produce detectable 8-OHdG, but was still able to effectively inhibit PARP-1 activity. Zinc supplementation reduced the formation of 8-OHdG, restored the PARP-1 activity inhibited by arsenite, but did not decrease ROS production. SiRNA knockdown of PARP-1 did not affect the 8-OHdG level induced by arsenic, while it greatly increased the 8-OHdG level produced by hydrogen peroxide indicating that PARP-1 is a molecular target of arsenite. Our findings demonstrate that in addition to inducing oxidative stress at higher concentrations, arsenite can also inhibit the function of a key DNA repair protein, PARP-1, even at very low concentrations, thus exacerbating the overall oxidative DNA damage produced by arsenite, and potentially, by other oxidants as well."
2018,28892646,Protective effects of Mentha spicata against nicotine-induced toxicity in liver and erythrocytes of Wistar rats.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Mentha spicata supplementation against nicotine-induced oxidative damage in the liver and erythrocytes of Wistar rats. Bioactive substances were determined by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Animals were divided into 4 groups of 6 rats each: a normal control group, a nicotine-treated group (1 mg/kg), a group receiving M. spicata extract (100 mg/kg), and a group receiving both M. spicata extract (100 mg/kg) and nicotine (1 mg/kg). Many phenolic acids were identified in the M. spicata aqueous extract. After 2 months of treatment, nicotine induced an increase in the level of white blood cells and a marked decrease in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and haematocrit. Aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities were also found to be higher in nicotine-treated group than those of the control group. Furthermore, nicotine-treated rats exhibited oxidative stress, as evidenced by a decrease in antioxidant enzymes activities and an increase in lipid peroxidation level in liver and erythrocytes. Interestingly, the oral administration of M. spicata extract by nicotine-treated rats alleviated such disturbances. M. spicata contained bioactive compounds that possess important antioxidant potential and protected liver and erythrocytes against nicotine-induced damage."
2002,11823753,Fruit juices inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated drug uptake to decrease the oral availability of fexofenadine.,"Our objective was to examine the effect of different fruits and their constituents on P-glycoprotein and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) activities in vitro and on drug disposition in humans.P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin or vinblastine efflux was determined in polarized epithelial cell monolayers. OATP-mediated fexofenadine uptake was measured in a transfected cell line. The oral pharmacokinetics of 120 mg fexofenadine was assessed with water, 25%-strength grapefruit juice, or normal-strength grapefruit, orange, or apple juices (1.2 L over 3 hours) in a randomized 5-way crossover study in 10 healthy subjects.Grapefruit juice and segments and apple juice at 5% of normal strength did not alter P-glycoprotein activity. Grapefruit extract reduced transport. 6',7'-Dihydroxybergamottin had modest inhibitory activity (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 33 micromol/L). In contrast, grapefruit, orange, and apple juices at 5% of normal strength markedly reduced human OATP and rat oatp activity. 6',7'-Dihydroxybergamottin potently inhibited rat oatp3 and oatp1 (IC(50), 0.28 micromol/L). Other furanocoumarins and bioflavonoids also reduced rat oatp3 activity. Grapefruit, orange, and apple juices decreased the fexofenadine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), the peak plasma drug concentration (C(max)), and the urinary excretion values to 30% to 40% of those with water, with no change in the time to reach C(max), elimination half-life, renal clearance, or urine volume in humans. Change in fexofenadine AUC with juice was variable among individuals and inversely dependent on value with water.Fruit juices and constituents are more potent inhibitors of OATPs than P-glycoprotein activities, which can reduce oral drug bioavailability. Results support a new model of intestinal drug absorption and mechanism of food-drug interaction."
2011,21720007,"Batatasin I, a naturally occurring phenanthrene derivative, isolated from tuberous roots of Dioscorea batatas suppresses eicosanoids generation and degranulation in bone marrow derived-mast cells.","To find anti-inflammatory compounds from the tuberous roots of Dioscorea batatas, we isolated 6-hydroxy-2,4,7-trimethoxyphenanthrene (batatasin I) from the dichloromethane (CH(2)Cl(2)) fraction of this plant. Batatasin I inhibited both the generation of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) and degranulation reaction in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). This compound inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) dependent PGD(2) generation in a dose dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 1.78 µM. Western blotting probed with specific anti-COX-2 antibodies showed that the decrease in the quantity of the PGD(2) generation was accompanied by a decrease in the COX-2 protein level. In addition, this compound also inhibited the production of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) dependent LTC(4) in a dose dependent manner (IC(50), 1.56 µM). Batatasin I also inhibited the mast cell degranulation reaction (IC(50), 6.7 µM) in BMMCs. This result indicates that batatasin I could be developed as an anti-inflammatory agent through further investigation."
2014,24295699,Effects of preservation methods on amino acids and 5'-nucleotides of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms.,"In this study, the proximate composition, free amino acids content and 5'-nucleotides in frozen, canned and salted Agaricus bisporus (A. bisporus) were investigated. We found that the three kinds of A. bisporus products were good sources of protein, with amount varying in the ranges of 16.54-24.35g/100g (dry weight). Freezing, canning and salting process, followed by 6months of storage led to a significant reduction in free amino acids, especially tyrosine, alanine, glutamine and cysteine. There were medium levels of MSG-like amino acids in frozen A. bisporus and canned A. bisporus, and low levels of MSG-like amino acids in salted A. bisporus. The mount of flavor 5'-nucleotides in frozen A. bisporus was higher than that of canned and salted A. bisporus. The present study thus suggests that freezing is beneficial for the preservation of A. bisporus. "
2010,20412607,Changes in starch physical characteristics following digestion of foods in the human small intestine.,"Factors controlling the concentration of resistant starch (RS) in foods are of considerable interest on account of the potential for this type of fibre to deliver health benefits to consumers. The present study was aimed at establishing changes in starch granule morphology as a result of human small-intestinal digestion. Volunteers with ileostomy consumed six selected foods: breakfast cereal (muesli), white bread, oven-baked French fries, canned mixed beans and a custard containing either a low-amylose maize starch (LAMS) or a high-amylose maize starch (HAMS). Analysis showed that digesta total RS (as a fraction of ingested starch) was: muesli, 8.9 %; bread, 4.8 %; fries, 4.2 %; bean mix, 35.9 %; LAMS custard, 4.0 %; HAMS custard, 29.1 %. Chromatographic analysis showed that undigested food contained three major starch fractions. These had average molecular weights (MW) of 43,500 kDa, 420 kDa and 8.5 kDa and were rich in amylopectin, higher-MW amylose and low-MW amylose, respectively. The low-MW amylose fraction became enriched preferentially in the stomal effluent while the medium-MW starch fraction showed the greatest loss. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy showed that absorbance at 1022 per cm decreased after digestion while the absorbance band at 1047 per cm became greater. Such changes have been suggested to indicate shifts from less ordered to more ordered granule structures. Further analysis of amylose composition by scanning iodine spectra indicated that the MW of amylose in ileal digesta was lower than that of undigested amylose. It appears that high-MW amylose is preferentially digested and that MW, rather than amylose content alone, is associated with resistance of starch to digestion in the upper gut of humans."
2014,24402636,Effect of zinc supplementation on inflammatory markers and adipokines in young obese women.,"Obesity is a chronic inflammatory state characterized by altered adipokine production and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. The study explored the effect of zinc supplementation on inflammatory markers and adipocyte hormones in young obese women. Twenty five non-obese women and forty obese women (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)) aged 19-28 years were recruited for this study. Twenty obese women of the study group took 30 mg/day of supplemental zinc as zinc gluconate for 8 weeks and 20 obese women of control group took placebo. Usual dietary zinc intake was estimated from 3-day diet records. Serum zinc and urinary zinc concentration were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Inflammatory markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-6 and adipocyte hormones such as lepin and adiponectin were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Inflammatory markers and leptin were significantly higher, but adiponectin was significantly lower in obese women than non-obese women. Zinc supplementation increased serum zinc by 15% and urinary zinc by 56% (P < 0.05). The levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.03) and IL-6 (P = 0.006) significantly decreased with zinc supplementation, but not in placebo group. Serum leptin and plasma adiponectin concentration did not differ with either zinc supplementation or placebo. The levels of IL-6 and leptin were inversely associated with dietary zinc intake. These results suggest that zinc may have a favorable effect on obesity-related inflammation in young adults."
2005,16353958,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of guar gum matrix tablets for oral controlled release of water-soluble diltiazem hydrochloride.,"The objective of the study was to develop guar gum matrix tablets for oral controlled release of water-soluble diltiazem hydrochloride. Matrix tablets of diltiazem hydrochloride, using various viscosity grades of guar gum in 2 proportions, were prepared by wet granulation method and subjected to in vitro drug release studies. Diltiazem hydrochloride matrix tablets containing either 30% wt/wt low-viscosity (LM1), 40% wt/wt medium-viscosity (MM2), or 50% wt/wt high-viscosity (HM2) guar gum showed controlled release. The drug release from all guar gum matrix tablets followed first-order kinetics via Fickian-diffusion. Further, the results of in vitro drug release studies in simulated gastrointestinal and colonic fluids showed that HM2 tablets provided controlled release comparable with marketed sustained release diltiazem hydrochloride tablets (D-SR tablets). Guar gum matrix tablets HM2 showed no change in physical appearance, drug content, or in dissolution pattern after storage at 40 degrees C/relative humidity 75% for 6 months. When subjected to in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation in healthy volunteers, the HM2 tablets provided a slow and prolonged drug release when compared with D-SR tablets. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo studies it was concluded that that guar gum matrix tablets provided oral controlled release of water-soluble diltiazem hydrochloride."
2016,27573488,Comparison of eating quality and physicochemical properties between Japanese and Chinese rice cultivars.,"In this study, we evaluated 16 Japanese and Chinese rice cultivars in terms of their main chemical components, iodine absorption curve, apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting property, resistant starch content, physical properties, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and enzyme activity. Based on these quality evaluations, we concluded that Chinese rice varieties are characterized by a high protein and the grain texture after cooking has high hardness and low stickiness. In a previous study, we developed a novel formula for estimating AAC based on the iodine absorption curve. The validation test showed a determination coefficient of 0.996 for estimating AAC of Chinese rice cultivars as unknown samples. In the present study, we developed a novel formulae for estimating the balance degree of the surface layer of cooked rice (A3/A1: a ratio of workload of stickiness and hardness) based on the iodine absorption curve obtained using milled rice."
2003,12821994,[Pregnancy and birth in women with epilepsy].,"More than 90 % of all women with epilepsy who take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) will undergo normal pregnancies and give birth to children free of birth defects, though mothers on AEDs have two to three times higher incidence of malformations. Uncertainty exists regarding which AEDs are the most teratogenic. Valproate and carbamazepine have been associated with neural tube defects and phenytoin with cleft lip/palate and heart and urogenital defects. All women taking valproate and carbamazepine are advised to take 4 mg/day of folic acid at least one month before pregnancy and during the first trimester. Other women with epilepsy in fertile age are recommended to take 0.4 mg/day. Vitamin K 10 mg/day should be given the last 4 weeks to women on liver enzyme-inducing AEDs. During pregnancy, ultrasound should be performed around weeks 12 and 17. Amniocentesis for a-fetoprotein should be offered at week 15 to women using valproate and carbamazepine. Most women with epilepsy do not experience any change in seizure frequency during pregnancy and have normal vaginal deliveries. Use of monotherapy, lowest effective dose and retard formulations of AEDs, are advised during pregnancy. A seizure during labour is very rare, seen in 1-2 % of cases. Breast-feeding is encouraged for most AEDs, although barbiturates and benzodiazepines may have sedative effects on the infant. Pregnancy is generally safe in women with epilepsy, but preconception counselling and close collaboration during the pregnancy between the gynaecologist and the neurologist is warranted."
2011,21896619,Grapefruit juice and licorice increase cortisol availability in patients with Addison's disease.,"Failure to mirror the diurnal cortisol profile could contribute to the impaired subjective health status in Addison's disease (AD). Some patients report benefit from the use of various nutritional compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of licorice and grapefruit juice (GFJ) on the absorption and metabolism of cortisone acetate (CA).Patients (n=17) with AD on stable CA replacement therapy were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. They were assessed on their ordinary CA medication and following two 3-day periods of co-administration of licorice or GFJ.Time series of glucocorticoids (GCs) in serum and saliva were obtained, and GCs in 24 h urine samples were determined. The main outcome measure was the area under the curve (AUC) for serum cortisol in the first 2.6 h after orally administered CA.Compared with the ordinary treatment, the median AUC for serum cortisol increased with licorice (53 783 vs 50 882, P<0.05) and GFJ (60 661 vs 50 882, P<0.05). Median cortisol levels in serum were also elevated 2.6 h after tablet ingestion (licorice 223 vs 186 nmol/l, P<0.05; GFJ 337 vs 186 nmol/l, P<0.01). Licorice increased the median urinary cortisol/cortisone ratio (0.43 vs 0.21, P<0.00001), whereas GFJ increased the (allo-tetrahydrocortisol+tetrahydrocortisol)/tetrahydrocortisone ratio (0.55 vs 0.43, P<0.05).Licorice and in particular GFJ increased cortisol available to tissues in the hours following oral CA administration. Both patients and physicians should be aware of these interactions."
2000,11193415,Purification of stearidonic acid (18:4(n-3)) and hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)) from algal fatty acid with lipase and medium pressure liquid chromatography.,"Stearidonic acid (18:4(n-3)) and hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)) are included in some edible marine algae such as Undaria pinnatifida and Ulva pertusa with relatively high compositions (up to 40%) of total fatty acids. In order to prepare 16:4(n-3) and 18:4(n-3) enriched fatty acid concentrates, we screened for a suitable lipase which concentrates these acids by the removal of other fatty acids in the selective esterification reaction reported by Shimada et al. (Shimada et al. (1997), J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc., 74, 1465-1470). In combination with the lipase reaction and reversed-phase medium pressure liquid chromatography, we purified 18:4(n-3) and 16:4(n-3) to more than 95% purity."
2013,23305162,In vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of plants of the ethnopharmacopeia from northwest of Mexico.,"The aim of this study, is to investigate the in vitro antioxidant activity, the total phenols content, the flavonoids content and the antiproliferative activity of methanolic extracts of the plants: Krameria erecta, Struthanthus palmeri, Phoradendron californicum, Senna covesii and Stegnosperma halimifolium, used by different ethnic groups from northwestern Mexico in the treatment and cure of various diseases.The in vitro antioxidant activity was measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power assay (FRAP), the total phenols content was measured by Folin-Ciocalteau assay, the flavonoids content by the AlCl(3) colorimetric method and the antiproliferative activity (line cells HeLa, RAW 264.7, M12A(k).C3.F6 and L929) using MTT method.The K. erecta extract showed the higher radical scavenging activity (67.88%), antioxidant activity by FRAP (1.41 mg Trolox Eq), the highest total phenols content (598.51 mg Galic Acid Eq/g extract), the highest flavonoids content (3.80 mg Quercetin Eq/g extract) and the greatest antiproliferative activity in a dose dependent manner against most Cell line evaluated. A positive correlation was found between the antioxidant activity and the flavonoids content.This study is the first report on the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of the five species evaluated. The results demostrate that there is a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and the flavonoids content, indicating that these type of polyphenols could be the major contributors to the observed antioxidant activity in the evaluated plant extracts. Of the extracts evaluated, that of Krameria erecta showed the greatest antioxidant and antiproliferative activities, a discovery that makes this species a promising candidate for future research."
2009,19224379,Prospective study of the association between grapefruit intake and risk of breast cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).,"Grapefruit inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and may affect estrogen metabolism. In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), we examined the relationships of grapefruit intake with risk of breast cancer and with serum sex hormone levels. 114,504 women with information on dietary intake of grapefruit and on reproductive and lifestyle risk factors were followed for a median 9.5 years and 3,747 incident breast cancers were identified. Fifty-nine percent of women reported eating grapefruit, 4% ate > or = 60 g/day. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for breast cancer according to grapefruit intake, adjusting for study centre, reproductive factors, body mass index, energy intake, and alcohol intake. Grapefruit intake was not related to the risk of breast cancer: compared with women who ate no grapefruit, women with the highest intake of > or =60 g/day had a HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.13), p for linear trend = 0.5. There was no relationship between grapefruit intake and breast cancer risk among premenopausal women, all postmenopausal women, or postmenopausal women categorized by hormone replacement therapy use (all p>0.05). There was no association between grapefruit intake and estradiol or estrone among postmenopausal women. In this study, we found no evidence of an association between grapefruit intake and risk of breast cancer."
2006,16651728,The anti-gastropathic and anti-rheumatic effect of niga-ichigoside F1 and 23-hydroxytormentic acid isolated from the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus in a rat model.,"This study was undertaken to produce the clinical merits of two natural antinociceptive anti-inflammatory triterpenoids which synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs do not have. The triterpenoid glycoside niga-ichigoside F1 (NIF1) and its aglycone 23-hydroxytormentic acid (23-HTA), which were isolated from the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus (Rosaceae), reduced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) factor and C-reactive protein (CRP) factor in Freund's complete adjuvant reagent-induced rats, suggesting that these two triterpenoids had an anti-rheumatic effect. It was also shown that treatment with NIF1 or 23-HTA reduced gastric lesion extent, acidity and total gastric acid output induced by EtOH plus sodium salicylate in a gastric secretion test. Moreover, 23-HTA had a greater effect than the glycoside, NIF1. To clarify the anti-gastropathic mechanism of these two compounds, their free radical scavenging activities in the gastric mucosa were examined in a rat EtOH-sodium salicylate-induced gastropathy model. The two compounds significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, indicating that the healing effects of NIF1 and 23-HTA against gastropathy are associated with free radical scavenging enzyme activities. These results support the notion that the long-term administration of NIF1 or 23-HTA should overcome the adverse effects of synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs."
2003,12754107,High resolution X-ray structure of potent anti-HIV pokeweed antiviral protein-III.,"Pokeweed antiviral protein III (PAP-III), a naturally occurring protein isolated from late summer leaves of the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana), has potent anti-HIV activity by an as yet undetermined molecular mechanism. PAP-III belongs to a family of ribosome-inactivating proteins that catalytically deadenylate ribosomal and viral RNA. The chemical modification of PAP-III by reductive methylation of its lysine residues significantly improved the crystal quality for X-ray diffraction studies. Trigonal crystals of the modified PAP-III, with unit cell parameters a=b=80.47A, c=76.21A, were obtained using 30% PEG400 as the precipitant. These crystals contained one enzyme molecule per asymmetric unit and diffracted up to 1.5A, when exposed to a synchrotron source. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of PAP-III at 1.6A resolution, which was solved by molecular replacement using the homology model of PAP-III as a search model. The fold typical of other ribosome-inactivating proteins is conserved, despite several differences on the surface and in the loop regions. Residues Tyr(69), Tyr(117), Glu(172), and Arg(175) are expected to define the active site of PAP-III. Molecular modeling studies of the interactions of PAP-III and PAP-I with a single-stranded RNA heptamer predicted a more potent anti-HIV activity for PAP-III due to its unique surface topology and more favorable charge distribution in its 20A-long RNA binding active center cleft. In accordance with the predictions of the modeling studies, PAP-III was more potent than PAP-I in depurinating HIV-1 RNA."
2007,17973899,The role of haem oxygenase-1 in the decrease of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression by curcumin.,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is involved in neutrophil transmigration across endothelium during sepsis-induced acute lung injury and anti-ICAM-1 interventions may represent new strategy of pulmonary protection. Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory actions via decrease of expression of adhesion molecules. We investigated the role of HO-1 in the action of curcumin, a naturally occurring yellow pigment isolated from plant Curcuma longa L., on ICAM-1 expression in tumour necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated EA.hy926 cells and lungs of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Both, in vitro and in vivo curcumin induced HO-1 and curcumin-elicited induction of HO-1 was associated with inhibition ICAM-1 expression. Moreover, curcumin significantly inhibited pulmonary sequestration of leucocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide as evidenced by decrease of myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue. Both in vitro and in vivo effects of curcumin were reversed by an inhibitor of HO activity, chromium (III) mesoporphyrin IX chloride. We conclude that induction of HO-1, via decrease of endothelial ICAM-1, plays a pivotal role in curcumin-dependent prevention of pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils in a mouse model of endotoxaemia."
2012,22945624,Evaluating the potential role of pomegranate peel in aluminum-induced oxidative stress and histopathological alterations in brain of female rats.,"Studies have shown that pomegranate, Punica granatum Linn. (Lythraceae), has remarkable biological and medicinal properties. However, the effects of pomegranate peel methanolic extract (PPME) on the aluminum-induced oxidative stress and histopathological change have not been reported yet. To determine the effect of PPME (200 mg/kg bwt) on the aluminum chloride (AlCl₃; 34 mg/kg bwt)-induced neurotoxicity, aluminum accumulation in brain and oxidant/antioxidant status were determined. The change of brain structure was investigated with hematoxylin and eosin, and anti-apoptosis effects of PPME were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The present study showed an indication of carcinogenicity in the AlCl₃-treated group representing an increase in tissue tumor markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α and angiogenin and inflammation by inducing an increase in prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2α. PPME protected brain through decreasing the aluminum accumulation and stimulating antioxidant activities and anti-apoptotic proteins namely Bcl-2. Therefore, these results indicated that pomegranate peel methanolic extract could inhibit aluminum-induced oxidative stress and histopathological alternations in brain of female rats, and these effects may be related to anti-apoptotic and antioxidants activities."
2008,26049226,Purification and characterisation of trypsins from the pyloric caeca of mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi).,"Two trypsins of anionic form (trypsin A) and cationic form (trypsin B) from the pyloric caeca of mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) were highly purified by a series of chromatographies, including DEAE-Sephacel, Sephacryl S-200 HR, Q-Sepharose or SP-Sepharose. Purified trypsins revealed a single band on native-PAGE. The molecular weights of trypsin A and B were 21kDa and 21.5kDa, respectively, as estimated by SDS-PAGE, both under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Zymography analysis showed that both trypsins were active in degrading casein. Trypsin A and B exhibited maximal activity at 35°C and 40°C, respectively, and shared the same optimal pH of 8.5, using Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA as substrate. The two trypsins were stable up to 45°C and in the pH range from 4.5 to 11.0. Trypsin inhibitors are effective on these two enzymes and their susceptibilities were similar. Both trypsins were activated by metal ions such as Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and inactivated by Fe(2+), Zn(2+), Mn(2+), Cu(2+), Al(3+), Ba(2+) and Co(2+) to different degrees. Apparent Km values of trypsin A and B were 2.18μM and 1.88μM, and Kcat values were 81.6S(-1) and 111.3S(-1) for Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis using anti-common carp trypsin A positively cross-reacted with the two enzymes, suggesting their similarity. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of trypsin B was determined as IVGGYECEAH, which is highly homologous with trypsins from other species of fish. "
2015,26041181,"Some physicochemical characteristics of pinus (Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus pinea L., Pinus pinaster and Pinus canariensis) seeds from North Algeria, their lipid profiles and volatile contents.","Physicochemical characteristics of seeds of some pinus species (Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus pinea L., Pinus pinaster and Pinus canariensis) grown in North Algeria were determined. The results showed that the seeds consist of 19.8-36.7% oil, 14.25-26.62% protein, 7.8-8.6% moisture. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium were the predominant elements present in seeds. Pinus seed's oil physicochemical properties show acid values (4.9-68.9), iodine values (93.3-160.4) and saponification values (65.9-117.9). Oil analysis showed that the major unsaturated fatty acids for the four species were linoleic acid (30-59%) and oleic acid (17.4-34.6%), while the main saturated fatty acid was palmitic acid (5-29%). Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry analysis of P. halepensis Mill., P. pinaster and P. canariensis volatile oils indicated that the major volatile compound was the limonene with relative percentage of 3.1, 7.5 and 10.8, respectively.

2016,27234544,Investigation of the potential immunomodulatory effects of resveratrol on equine whole blood: An in vitro investigation.,"Horses affected with gastrointestinal conditions such as colic or colitis are at substantial risk for translocation of bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) from the gastrointestinal tract into circulation resulting in systemic inflammation and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a need for effective preventive and treatment strategies aimed at minimizing the host's inflammatory reaction to these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from gastrointestinal disease. Resveratrol (RES, trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a phytoalexin commonly found in fruits and beverages, including red wine. Health benefits associated with the consumption of red wine have been attributed to RES. Resveratrol has been significantly shown to exert a powerful anti-inflammatory effect in laboratory animals subjected to experimental endotoxemia/sepsis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine in vitro whether RES had an inhibitory effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in cultivated whole blood (Cwb) following stimulation by PAMPs. We hypothesized that RES would inhibit TNF production in Cwb following stimulation by LPS or lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Production of TNF bioactivity in Cwb was measured in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (control), ethanol (solvent control), dexamethasone (anti-inflammatory control), LPS, LTA, and three different concentrations of RES. Both LPS and LTA stimulated TNF production, and addition of dexamethasone was inhibitory to this effect. An anti-inflammatory effect for RES was not demonstrated under the current experimental conditions. Further studies are required to characterize the effect of RES on the equine innate immune system during systemic inflammation. "
2015,26306668,Neuroprotective effect of Spirulina fusiform and amantadine in the 6-OHDA induced Parkinsonism in rats.,"Multi-factorial etiology exists in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The imbalance of anti-oxidant enzymes and dopamine level leads to Parkinsonism. The objective of this study was to assess the protective effect of Spirulina fusiform alone and in combination with amantadine against Parkinsonism effect in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced rat model.S. fusiform was administered in different groups (500 mg/kg, once daily and twice daily) and a combination of spirulina (500 mg/kg, once daily) with amantadine (20 mg/kg once daily) for 30 days before and 14 days after a single injection of 6-OHDA into the dorsal striatum. Post lesion produced rotational behavior which was measured at two week intervals (37th and 44th day). Locomotors activity was also done at 44th and muscle coordination at 48th day. Dorsal striatum was isolated from rat brain for evaluating the antioxidant assays and dopamine content at 49th day.Both the body rotations (ipsilateral and contralateral) were found to have a statistically significant (p<0.001) decrease by 34.26 and 52% after treatment with spirulina (Twice a day) in spirulina treated lesioned group. A higher percentage of improvement was shown in the reduction of ipsilateral (57.34%) and contralateral (78.3%) rotations in combination of spirulina with amantadine treated lesioned group rather than spirulina alone treated lesioned groups when compared with positive control lesioned group. Body movements and locomotor activity were improved statistically (p<0.0001) significant in both treated lesioned groups (Combination of spirulina with amantadine and spirulina twice daily). Similar results were also seen in anti-oxidant levels which later on reached to the normal value. The levels of dopamine content had a statistically significant (p<0.0001) increase by 78.3% only in case of spirulina with amantadine treated lesioned group.Spirulina is a potent nutraceutical supplement all over the world, so my preclinical study may contribute to give an additional adjuvant drug therapy in aging related disorders (Neurodegenerative as well as diabetes associated neurodegenerative disorders)."
2019,31545226,Effects of berberine and metformin on intestinal inflammation and gut microbiome composition in db/db mice.,"Berberine and metformin, both established pharmaceutical agents with herbal origins, have incidental beneficial effects on multiple diseases, including diabetes. These effects have been speculated to occur via the gut microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and tight junction (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal epithelium was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model."
2004,15467222,"Oriental medicinal herb, Periploca sepium, extract inhibits growth and IL-6 production of human synovial fibroblast-like cells.","Periploca sepium (PS) has traditionally been used in oriental medicine for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the aqueous extract of PS (PSE) in its effects on human rheumatoid arthritis-derived fibroblast-like cells. In cell culture studies, PSE inhibited the growth and IL-6 production of the cells in dose dependent manners. The extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra (GG), which has also been used to treat RA and chosen as a reference here, slightly inhibited the growth of RA cells. A study of PSE fractionation indicated that the active material inhibiting IL-6 production is filterable by ultrafiltration, suggesting that substances with low molecular weight might be involved in an inhibition of IL-6 production. These results support the view that PSE represents a rich source of growth inhibition and anti-IL 6 production."
2017,29198923,Enteromorpha and polysaccharides from enteromorpha ameliorate loperamide-induced constipation in mice.,"Slow-transit constipation(STC)is a disease characterized by functional gastrointestinal disorder. Common laxatives used in clinical practice against constipation such as Senna have side effects. Enteromorpha(EP)is a common marine alga, and the polysaccharide extracted from EP has been reported possessing anti-cancer and anti-inflammation effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of EP and Polysaccharides from Enteromorpha (PEP) on loperamide induced constipated mice model and illustrating mechanism of action. We investigated the effect of EP and PEP on fecal water content, defecation frequency and gastrointestinal transit (GI) time of loperamide-induced STC mice. In addition, serum Nitric Oxide (NO) content and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor1 (VIPR1) as well as serotonin receptor (5-HT4) expression in the distal colon were analyzed. Furthermore, we determined the role of EP and PEP on microbiota distribution using stool genomic 16S rRNA sequencing. EP and PEP significantly enhanced intestinal motility function, and alleviated constipation associated intestinal inflammation. Moreover, EP and PEP significantly decreased serum NO concentration, down-regulated VIPR1 expression and up-regulated 5-HT4 expression in distal colon. Genomic stool DNA MiSeq Sequencing Analysis of microbiota community structures and distribution revealed that intestinal microecological changes caused by constipation recovered after both EP and PEP treatment. Our results indicate that EP and PEP are potent natural products which could be suggested in constipation therapy strategies."
2017,28889028,Development and in vitro/in vivo performance of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems loaded with candesartan cilexetil.,"Candesartan cilexetil is widely used in the management of hypertension and heart failure. The drug delivery encounters obstacles of poor aqueous solubility, efflux by intestinal P-glycoprotein and vulnerability to enzymatic degradation in small intestine. Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) loaded with candesartan cilexetil were successfully developed to overcome such obstacles. Preliminary screening was carried out to select proper surfactant, co-surfactant and oil combination for successful SNEDDS formulation. All screened excipients were reported for their P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) modulation activity. Ternary and pseudo ternary diagrams were constructed to optimize the system. Peppermint oil and clove oil showed a high emulsification ability. The nature of obtained dispersions was identified to be nanoemulsions. Twenty-four formulations were evaluated for stability, robustness to dilution and self-emulsification efficiency. All formulations showed a very short emulsification time of <2min. The emulsification efficiency was significantly superior at pH6.8, at which the largest self-emulsifying region was also observed. Eight formulations were selected for further characterization according to cloud point measurement; mean droplet size, poly dispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential determination in addition to in vitro drug release study. All selected formulations showed very high cloud points (70-90°C), ultrafine mean droplet size (12±1.4 to 24.5±2.13nm), very low PDI values (0.015-0.1305) and almost a complete drug release after 12h. Formulation F15 (Peppermint oil 55% w/w: Cremophor RH40 25% w/w: Labrasol 20% w/w) was selected for further characterization. Its droplet size showed robustness to different dilution folds with different media and its TEM photograph showed spherical particles without any apparent aggregation even after 24h. Formulation F15 successfully controlled the systolic blood pressure of hypertensive rats for 24h with the maximum effect was observed after 2h. These results indicate that, SNEDDS could be promising delivery systems with a rapid onset of action and prolonged therapeutic effect of candesartan cilexetil."
1998,9868547,Screening and isolation of antibiotic resistance inhibitors from herb materials IV-resistance inhibitors from Anetheum graveolens and Acorus gramineus.,"The hexane fractions from methanolic extracts of Anetheum graveolens L. (Umbelliferae) and Acorus gramineus Soland. (Araceae), revealed potent inhibitory activities against the resistance of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus SA2 when combined with ampicillin (Am) or chloramphenicol (Cm). As active principles, carvone and the liquid mixture containing carvone from Anetheum graveolens L. and a liquid mixture mainly consisting of benzoic acid phenylmethyl ester (benzyl benzoate) from Acorus gramineus Soland, were identified. They showed resistance inhibition at the level of 20-50 micrograms/ml when combined with 100 or 50 micrograms/ml of Am or Cm, respectively."
2005,16297710,Chemopreventive properties of the ethanol extract of chinese licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) root: induction of apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.,"Much of the interest on the chemopreventive properties of licorice has been focused on the plant genius Glycyrrhiza glabra. In this study the ethanol extract of Chinese licorice root, Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G. uralensis) was investigated for its estrogenic effect and the ability to inhibit cell proliferation in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. The extract of the root of G. uralensis was fractionated in EtOH:H(2)O (80:20) (80% ethanol). The extract exhibited estrogenic effects similar to 17beta- estradiol (E2) and induced apoptosis at the same dose level (100 microg/ml) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, results were associated with up-regulation of tumor suppressor gene p53 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax. G. uralensis extract caused the up-regulation of p21(waf1/cip1) and down-regulation of cdk 2 and cyclin E and most significantly, induced G1 cell cycle arrest. This is the first study to show that the ethanolic extract of the root of G. uralensis has an estrogen-like activity and anti-cancer effects against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Whilst the use of phytoestrogens to protect against hormone-dependent cancers or as a 'natural' alternative to hormone replacement therapy remains controversial, the data in this paper support the suggestion that extracts of root of the Chinese licorice G. uralensis might be of importance in this debate."
2018,29277637,Synthesis and characterisation of arsenic nanoparticles and its interaction with DNA and cytotoxic potential on breast cancer cells.,"Therapeutic applications of arsenic trioxide (ATO) are limited due to their severe adverse effects. However, nanoparticles of ATO might possess inimitable biologic effects based on their structure and size which differ from their parent molecules. Based on this conception, AsNPs were synthesized from ATO and comparatively analysed for their interaction mechanism with DNA using spectroscopic & electrochemical techniques. Finally, anti-proliferative activity was assessed against different breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 & MCF-7) and normal non-cancerous cells (HEK-293). The DNA interaction study revealed that AsNPs and ATO exhibit binding constant values in the order of 106 which indicates strong binding interaction. Binding of AsNPs did not disturb the structural integrity of DNA, on the other hand an opposing effect was observed with ATO through biophysical techniques. Further, in vitro study, confirms cytotoxicity of ATO and AsNPs against different cells, however at particular concentration ATO exhibits more cytotoxicity than that of AsNPs. Furthermore, cytotoxicity was confirmed through acridine orange and comet assay. In conclusion, AsNPs are safer than ATO with comparable efficacy and might be a suitable candidate for the development of novel therapeutic agent against breast cancer and other solid tumours."
2014,25131260,The small GTPases regulate HMC05-induced NQO-1 expression with an antioxidant effect in smooth muscle cells.,"Recently, Banhabackchulchunmatang (HMC05) has been implicated as a preventive and/or therapeutic candidate for cardiovascular diseases due to its inhibition of atherosclerosis lesions and its reduction of neointima formation. Knowledge of the mechanism of HMC05 in smooth muscle cells (SMC) is limited. However, SMC may be a potential target for HMC05 therapy because they are supported by the HMC05-mediated preservation of medial smooth muscle cell layers in pathogenic progression. Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that the effect of HMC05 is associated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H):quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) gene regulation, which precipitates an antioxidant effect in SMC. HMC05 significantly increased NQO-1 gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The reactive oxygen species-mediated toxicity that was generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase was suppressed by HMC05. The knockdown of the NQO-1 gene abrogated the HMC05-mediated cytoprotection. Interestingly, pretreatment with a chemical inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase 1 or farnesyl transferase abolished the NQO-1 gene induction and cytoprotection by HMC05. The transfection of dominant negative RhoA or Ras suppressed HMC05-induced gene expression. Berberine and hesperidin, which are found in large quantities in HMC05, also induced NQO-1 gene expression. Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that HMC05 is efficacious in protection against oxidative stress through NOQ-1 gene induction via the regulation of RhoA and/or Ras, and that berberine and hesperidin are major components of NQO-1 gene induction. This study provides mechanistic targets of HMC05 in reducing atherosclerotic lesions in atherosclerosis. "
2014,24728876,Effect of Physalis peruviana L. on cadmium-induced testicular toxicity in rats.,"Cadmium (Cd) stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species and causes tissue damage. We investigated here the protective effect of Physalis peruviana L. (family Solanaceae) against cadmium-induced testes toxicity in rats. Twenty-eight Wistar albino rats were used. They were divided into four groups (n=7). Group 1 was used as control. Group 2 was intraperitoneally injected with 6.5 mg/kg body weight (bwt) of cadmium chloride for 5 days. Group 3 was orally treated with 200 mg/kg bwt of methanolic extract of physalis (MEPh). Group 4 was pretreated with MEPh before cadmium for 5 days. Changes in body and testes weights were determined. Oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, and testosterone level were measured. Histopathological changes of testes were examined, and the immunohistochemical staining for the proapoptotic (caspase-3) protein was performed. The injection of cadmium caused a significant decrease in body weight, while a significant increase in testes weight and testes weight index was observed. Pretreatment with MEPh was associated with significant reduction in the toxic effects of Cd as shown by reduced testicular levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and caspase-3 expression and increased glutathione content, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and testosterone were also increased. Testicular histopathology showed that Cd produced an extensive germ cell apoptosis, and the pretreatment of MEPh in Cd-treated rats significantly reduced Cd-induced testicular damage. On the basis of the above results, it can be hypothesized that P. peruviana L. has a protective effect against cadmium-induced testicular oxidative stress and apoptosis in the rat."
2001,11597580,Involvement of a post-transcriptional mechanism in the inhibition of CYP1A1 expression by resveratrol in breast cancer cells.,"Resveratrol decreases basal and induced CYP1A1 mRNA/protein levels in both in vitro and in vivo models, and some studies suggest that resveratrol acts as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist. Treatment of T47D or MCF-7 cells with 10 microM resveratrol inhibited induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and CYP1A1-dependent activity after treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), as previously reported. In contrast, resveratrol did not inhibit TCDD-induced reporter gene activity in cells transfected with an Ah-responsive construct containing a human CYP1A1 gene promoter insert, whereas 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone, a ""pure"" AhR antagonist, inhibited this response. Resveratrol induced transformation of the rat cytosolic AhR and, after treatment of T47D and MCF-7 cells with resveratrol, a transformed nuclear AhR complex was observed. In contrast to 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone, resveratrol did not block TCDD-induced AhR transformation in vitro or nuclear uptake of the AhR complex in breast cancer cells. Thus, the action of resveratrol on the AhR was consistent with that of an AhR agonist; however, resveratrol did not exhibit functional AhR agonist or antagonist activities in breast cancer cells. Actinomycin D chase experiments in T47D cells showed that resveratrol and dehydroepiandrosterone both increased the rate of CYP1A1 mRNA degradation, whereas resveratrol did not affect CYP1A1-dependent activity in cells pretreated with TCDD for 18 hr. These data suggest that resveratrol inhibits CYP1A1 via an AhR-independent post-transcriptional pathway."
2013,23646894,O-GlcNAcylation and p50/p105 binding of c-Rel are dynamically regulated by LPS and glucosamine in BV2 microglia cells.,"Previously, we demonstrated that glucosamine (GlcN) exerts a suppressive effect on LPS-induced inducible NOS (iNOS) through the inhibition of NF-κB activation in BV2 mouse microglial cells. The purpose of the present study was to examine the mechanisms by which GlcN inhibits NF-κB activation.BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS with or without GlcN. NF-κB/c-Rel activities were studied by EMSA, nuclear translocation, reporter assay or chromatin immunoprecipitation. Wheat germ agglutinin precipitation or galactosyltransferase assay were used to measure O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) of c-Rel. Protein-protein interactions were examined by co-immunoprecipitation.LPS stimulated the activation of c-Rel, increased the O-GlcNAcylation of c-Rel and enhanced the binding of c-Rel to the NF-κB site in the iNOS promoter; GlcN attenuated these effects of LPS. O-GlcNAcylation of both nuclear and cytosolic forms of c-Rel was increased by LPS and reduced by GlcN. LPS increased the interaction of c-Rel with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and p50/p105, and GlcN suppressed these interactions. Knockdown of OGT reduced the c-Rel O-GlcNAcylation and c-Rel-p50 interaction in response to LPS, but did not affect either the binding of c-Rel to the iNOS promoter or the transcriptional activity of c-Rel.In BV2 microglial cells, the anti-inflammatory effect of GlcN is mediated by prevention of the prolonged activation of transcription factors, c-Rel and NF-κB. Further clarification of the mechanism by which GlcN exerts this effect will facilitate the development of pharmacological strategies for preventing excessive NO formation when targeting inflammatory diseases of the periphery or CNS."
2019,31382820,"Purification, structural elucidation and in vivo immunity-enhancing activity of polysaccharides from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) seeds.","Quinoa crude polysaccharides (QPS) were extracted from Chenopodium quinoa Willd. The soluble non-starch polysaccharide fraction (QPS1) was subsequently purified by DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography, using QPS as raw materials. Its chemical structure was identified using FT-IR, NMR, AFM, SEM and Congo red staining. High performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) was used to determine molecular weight, and composition by HPLC. QPS1, with a molecular weight of 34.0 kDa, was mainly composed of mannose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose at a molar ratio of 2.63:2.40:1.64:6.28:1.95:2.48:5.01. In addition, we evaluated the ameliorative effects of QPS1 on the improvement of anti-cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression in ICR mice. The result exhibited significantly immune-enhancing activity: QPS1 successfully improved the content of IFN-γ, IL-6, IFN-ɑ, IgM and lysozyme (LYSO) in serum for three weeks, enhanced the phagocytic function of mononuclear macrophages and ameliorated delayed allergy in mice."
,15133533,Bioavailability of metronidazole in rabbits after administration of a rectal suppository.,"The bioavailability of metronidazole in rabbits was studied using plasma concentration measurements after the administration of the drug in a hydrophilic (glycerogelatin) suppository form. The peak in the plasma concentration time curve occurred about 1 hour after administration, indicating that the rate of absorption is fast and equivalent to that observed in humans after oral administration. There was rapid elimination of the drug, as indicated by a relatively high elimination rate constant and low plasma half-life. The in vitro dissolution profile of the suppositories further confirms rapid absorption of the drug from the suppositories in the rectum. The presence of Tween 80 enhanced the in vitro release of metronidazole, but the presence of a hydrogenated vegetable oil lubricant (Lubritab) caused retardation in the drug release from the suppositories."
2005,16112415,Protective effects of black tea extract on testosterone induced oxidative damage in prostate.,"Since ancient times, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidative properties of tea have been recognized. Black tea (Camellia sinensis) contains a variety of polyphenolic ingredients including the theaflavins (TF), thearubigins (TG) and catechins. Components from black tea have been accounted to play an important role in scavenging free radicals generated by mutagens and carcinogens. Androgens are the key factors in either the initiation or progression of prostate cancer (PCA) by inducing oxidative stress. In the present set of investigations, the antioxidative potential of black tea extract against androgen mediated oxidative stress in male Wistar rats has been studied. Testosterone was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. subcutaneously, consecutively for 5 days. Prior to androgen administration, animals were kept on 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% aqueous tea extract (ATE) as sole source of drinking fluid for 15 days. The prostate tissue was dissected out for biochemical analysis for antioxidant enzymes viz. catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR). The results revealed that testosterone administration induced the oxidative stress in rat prostate, however, in 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% ATE supplemented groups, a significant protective effect of black tea against testosterone induced oxidative injury was recorded. Hence, the study reveals that constituents present in black tea impart protection against androgen induced oxidative injury that may result in development of prostate cancer."
2013,23945721,Near-elimination of folate-deficiency anemia by mandatory folic acid fortification in older US adults: Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study 2003-2007.,"The United States implemented mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grains in 1998. Although several studies have documented the resulting decrease in anemia and folate deficiency, to our knowledge, no one has determined the prevalence of folate-deficiency anemia after fortification.We determined the prevalence of folate deficiency and folate-deficiency anemia within a sample of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort.The REGARDS cohort is a prospective cohort of 30,239 black and white participants living in the contiguous United States. We measured serum folate concentrations in a random sample of 1546 REGARDS participants aged ≥50 y with baseline hemoglobin and red blood cell mean corpuscular volume measurements. Folate deficiency was defined as a serum folate concentration <6.6 nmol/L (<3.0 ng/mL), and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in nonpregnant women (WHO criteria). Folate-deficiency anemia was defined as the presence of both folate deficiency and anemia.The mean hemoglobin concentration was 13.6 g/dL, and 15.9% of subjects had anemia. The median serum folate concentration was 34.2 nmol/L (15.1 ng/mL), and only 2 of 1546 participants 0.1%) were folate deficient. Both subjects were African American women with markedly elevated C-reactive protein concentrations, macrocytosis, and normal serum cobalamin concentrations; only one subject was anemic. Overall, the prevalence of folate-deficiency anemia was <0.1% (1 of 1546 subjects).Our data suggest that, after mandatory folic acid fortification, the prevalence of folate-deficiency anemia is nearly nonexistent in a community-dwelling population in the United States."
2007,17214610,Curcumin and kolaviron ameliorate di-n-butylphthalate-induced testicular damage in rats.,"The present study was carried out to evaluate the ameliorative effects of kolaviron (a biflavonoid from the seeds of Garcinia kola) and curcumin (from the rhizome, Curcuma longa L.) on the di-n-butylphthalate (DBP)-induced testicular damage in rats. Administration of DBP to rats at a dose of 2 g/kg for 9 days significantly decreased the relative testicular weights compared to the controls, while the weights of other organs remained unaffected. Curcumin or kolaviron did not affect all the organ weights of the animals. While only DBP treatment significantly increased the testicular malondialdehyde level and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity (gamma-GT), it markedly decreased glutathione level, the testicular catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, sperm gamma-GT activities and serum testosterone level compared to the control group. Data on cauda epididymal sperm count and live/dead ratio were not significantly affected in the DBP-treated rats. Alone, DBP treatment resulted in a 66% decrease in spermatozoa motility and a 77% increase in abnormal spermatozoa in comparison to control. DBP-treated rats showed marked degeneration of the seminiferous tubules with necrosis and defoliation of spermatocytes. The DBP-induced injuries in biochemical, spermatological parameters and histological structure of testis were recovered by treatment with kolaviron or curcumin. The pattern in the behaviour of these compounds might be correlated with their structural variations. Our results indicate that kolaviron and curcumin protect against testicular oxidative damage induced by DBP. The chemoprotective effects of these compounds may be due to their intrinsic antioxidant properties and as such may prove useful in combating phthalate-induced reproductive toxicity."
1997,9333895,[Dependence producing substances in the practice of the Insitute of Forensic Experts in Krakow].,"Different pieces of evidence connected with drug addiction have been used as material for studies carried out at the institute of Forensic Research in Kraków since the end of the sixties. The number of expert's opinions concerning these questions is constantly on the increase. Work done by the institute in this field has led to the creation of a list of dependence producing substances and their substitutes used by addicts, the methods of illicit production, and the ways and usable forms in which they are introduced into the system. The author describes the most popular drugs and their substitutes used in Poland. The number of these substitutes is big. Among them are: different medicines (e.g. Parkopan, Aviomarin) and solvents (toluene), various vegetable raw materials (e.g. Folium Stramonli, Pallocybe semilanceata). At the same time the use of genuine narcotics like morphine derivatives originating from Papaver somniferum and Cannabis sativa products, obtained by unusual methods of domestic production, was observed. The number of cases involving amphetamine and its analogues increased last year. The presence of opium alkaloids (morphine, codeine, papaverine, thebaine and narcotine as well as acetyl derivatives of morphine (heroine, 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine) and codeine (acetylcodeine) was detected in ""kompot"" by means of TLC, HPLC and GC/MS methods. The author also presents, from the analyst's point of view, analytical and interpretational problems of drugs of abuse, and regulations connected with drug addiction and with road traffic offences."
2017,28946186,Cryptotanshinone sensitizes antitumor effect of paclitaxel on tongue squamous cell carcinoma growth by inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Cryptotanshinone, a natural compound isolated from the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge (Danshen), has been found to induce cancer cells apoptosis and impair cell migration and invasion in various malignancies, but its antiproliferation and chemosensitization effects of Cryptotanshinone on tongue squamous cell carcinoma(TSCC)still remain fully elucidated. In this study, the effects of Cryptotanshinone on the proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle of human TSCC cells, including CAL 27 and SCC 9 cells, were measured. The results demonstrated that Cryptotanshinone dose-dependently inhibited cell migration and proliferation, and induced apoptosis in TSCC cells. Mechanistic study revealed that Cryptotanshinone suppressed the expression of p-STAT3, Bcl-2, CDK2, Snail and MMP2, and induced the expression of E-cadherin, P53, P21 and β-catenin. Furthermore, we found that the combination treatment of Cryptotanshinone and paclitaxel more effectively inhibited TSCC cell proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis via the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. In brief, we provided the new evidence that Cryptotanshinone could enhance the efficacy of paclitaxel on TSCC cells in vitro and demonstrated that STAT3 signaling pathway played an important role in Cryptotanshinone-induced anticancer effects in human TSCC."
2016,27374506,Wild almond (Prunus scoparia L.) as potential oilseed resource for the future: Studies on the variability of its oil content and composition.,"Wild almond genetic resources have still not received considerable attention for oil chemical compositions and uses. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of variation in oil content and fatty acid composition in forty Iranian accessions of Prunus scoparia L. (Spach) to identify genotypes with desirable traits in terms of oil quantity, quality and industrial utilization. Oil parameters and indices were measured, and fatty acid methyl ester analysis was carried out by gas liquid chromatography. Oleic and linoleic fatty acids showed high variability among accessions, ranging from 232.4 to 359.6g/kg oil and from 190.7 to 348.8g/kg oil, respectively. Total unsaturated fatty acid fraction was higher than total saturated fatty acid. The ranges of saponification number (199.2-202.1), iodine value (104.8-125.7kg I2/kg) and cetane number (43.8-48.8), confirmed that the oils have industrial potentialities. Results could contribute to select wild almond genotypes as genetic sources for oil production. "
2016,27006213,Homostachydrine (pipecolic acid betaine) as authentication marker of roasted blends of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (Robusta) beans.,"The occurrence of pipecolic acid betaine (homostachydrine) and its biosynthetic precursor N-methylpipecolic acid was detected for the first time in green coffee beans of Robusta and Arabica species. The analyses were conducted by HPLC-ESI tandem mass spectrometry and the metabolites identified by product ion spectra and comparison with authentic standards. N-methylpipecolic acid was found at similar levels in green coffee beans of Robusta and Arabica, whereas a noticeable difference of homostachydrine content was observed between the two green coffee bean species. Interestingly, homostachydrine content was found to be unaffected by coffee bean roasting treatment because of a noticeable heat stability, a feature that makes this compound a candidate marker to determine the content of Robusta and Arabica species in roasted coffee blends. To this end, a number of certified pure Arabica and Robusta green beans were analyzed for their homostachydrine content. Results showed that homostachydrine content was 1.5±0.5mg/kg in Arabica beans and 31.0±10.0mg/kg in Robusta beans. Finally, to further support the suitability of homostachydrine as quality marker of roasted blends of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans, commercial samples of roasted ground coffee blends were analyzed and the correspondence between the derived percentages of Arabica and Robusta beans with those declared on packages by manufacturers was verified."
1998,9766793,Effect of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment on circulating reticulated platelets in uremic patients: association with early improvement in platelet function.,"Recombinant human erythropoietin improves platelet function in uremia through the correction of anemia, but this effect can be seen also before the hematocrit rise. We studied 12 hemodialyzed patients (seven men, five women) who received recombinant human erythropoietin (40 IU kg(-1)i.v., three times weekly) and were evaluated before treatment and after three doses; 24 control subjects were used. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine, collagen, arachidonic acid, and ristocetin, and reticulated platelets determined by flow cytometry after staining with thiazole orange were measured. Platelet aggregation induced by all the agonists were impaired in uremic patients (P < 0.01), but ADP and ristocetin-induced aggregations improved after treatment (P < 0.01). Hemodialyzed patients had less reticulated platelets than controls (P < 0.01). Reticulated platelets increased after three doses of treatment (P < 0.01). In conclusion, improvement of platelet function at early stages of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment may be attributed to the increase in young platelets detected as reticulated platelets."
2008,18296318,Berries as chemopreventive dietary constituents--a mechanistic approach with the ApcMin/+ mouse.,"Berries contain a number of compounds that are proposed to have anticarcinogenic properties. We wanted to see if pure ellagic acid, natural ellagitannins and three wild berries have any effect on the adenoma formation in Apc- mutated Min/+ mice. Min/+ mice were fed high-fat AIN93-G diets containing 10% (w/w) freeze-dried bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), cloudberry seeds or cloudberry pulp or pure ellagic acid at 1564 mg/kg for 10 weeks. beta-Catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels in the adenomas and in the normal-appearing mucosa were determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Early changes in gene expression in the normal-appearing mucosa were analyzed by Affymetrix microarrays. Three wild berries significantly reduced tumour number (15-30%, p < 0.05), and cloudberry and lingonberry also reduced tumour size by over 60% (p < 0.01). Cloudberry resulted in decreased levels of nuclear beta-catenin and cyclin D1 and lingonberry in the level of cyclin D1 in the large adenomas (p < 0.05). Affymetrix microarrays revealed changes in genes implicated in colon carcinogenesis, including the decreased expression of the adenosine deaminase, ecto-5f-nucleotidase and PGE2 receptor subtype EP4. Ellagic acid had no effect on the number or size of adenomas in the distal or total small intestine but it increased adenoma size in the duodenum when compared with the control diet (p < 0.05). Neither cloudberry seed nor pulp had any effect on the adenoma formation. Berries seem to have great potential as a source of chemopreventive components."
1985,3985725,An apparent cluster of aplastic anemia in a small population of teenagers.,"Four teenagers with severe aplastic anemia, initially diagnosed and evaluated over a seven-year period at The Johns Hopkins Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Baltimore, were residents of the same small town in South Carolina. Estimated annual incidence for that age group in the town, based on the four cases, was 100 times the expected rate. All four of the teenagers had attended one of two junior high schools. An exploratory survey of all high-school students, comparing risk factors of those who had attended the ""affected"" junior high school with those who had attended the ""unaffected"" junior high school, showed no associations with exposure to glue, paint or varnishes, pesticides, history of hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis, or use of chloramphenicol or other suspected drugs. Weak associations were found between the affected junior high school and employment in the textile industry and in agriculture (specifically peach orchards)."
2007,17301733,Naringin is a major and selective clinical inhibitor of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2) in grapefruit juice.,"We showed previously that grapefruit and orange juices inhibited human enteric organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 in vitro and lowered oral fexofenadine bioavailability clinically. Inhibition of OATP1A2 transport by flavonoids in grapefruit (naringin) and orange (hesperidin) was conducted in vitro. Two randomized, crossover, pharmacokinetic studies were performed clinically. In one study, 120 mg of fexofenadine was ingested with 300 ml grapefruit juice, an aqueous solution of naringin at the same juice concentration (1,200 microM), or water. In the other study, fexofenadine was administered with grapefruit juice, with or 2 h before aqueous suspension of the particulate fraction of juice containing known clinical inhibitors of enteric CYP3A4, but relatively low naringin concentration (34 microM), or with water. Naringin and hesperidin's half-maximal inhibitions were 3.6 and 2.7 microM, respectively. Fexofenadine area under the plasma drug concentration-time curves (AUCs) with grapefruit juice and naringin solution were 55% (P<0.001) and 75% (P<0.05) of that with water, respectively. Fexofenadine AUCs with grapefruit juice and particulate fractions were 57% (P<0.001), 96% (not significant (NS)), and 97% (NS) of that with water, respectively. Individuals tested in both studies (n=9 of 12) had highly reproducible fexofenadine AUC with water (r(2)=0.85, P<0.001) and extent of reduction of it with grapefruit juice (r(2)=0.72, P<0.01). Naringin most probably directly inhibited enteric OATP1A2 to decrease oral fexofenadine bioavailability. Inactivation of enteric CYP3A4 was probably not involved. Naringin appears to have sufficient safety, specificity, and sensitivity to be a clinical OATP1A2 inhibitor probe. Inherent OATP1A2 activity may be influenced by genetic factors. This appears to be the first report of a single dietary constituent clinically modulating drug transport."
2015,25842329,Singlet oxygen autoxidation of vegetable oils: evidences for lack of synergy between β-carotene and tocopherols.,"The synergy between β-carotene and tocopherols--antioxidants protecting oils from oxidation, was analyzed in a model system. The model used stripped borage and evening primrose oils. A chlorophyll extract, β-carotene and one of the tocopherols were added together or separately to the oils. Oil oxidation was initiated by singlet oxygen that was produced by chlorophylls irradiated with the use of a xenon lamp equipped with the cut-off 600 nm filter. Experiments were carried out at two mole ratios of tocopherols to β-carotene, i.e. at 1:1 and 23:1. Analyses were performed using absorption and fluorescence spectra in the UV+Vis region. The results demonstrated an antagonistic action of the antioxidants. The protective effect of unsaturated fatty acids was significantly better in the case of β-carotene compared to the tocopherols. Furthermore, tocopherols were less effective in protecting the oils in the presence of β-carotene than without it."
2013,23170834,Notoginsenoside R1 attenuates cardiac dysfunction in endotoxemic mice: an insight into oestrogen receptor activation and PI3K/Akt signalling.,"Notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1), a novel phytoestrogen isolated from Panax notoginseng, is believed to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties. However, its cardioprotective properties and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we have assessed the contribution of the anti-inflammatory effects of NG-R1 to the amelioration of septic cardiac dysfunction and inflammation in mice.We assessed cardiac function in mice by echocardiography. We studied the protein or mRNA levels of some inflammatory factors, apoptotic factors and oestrogen receptors (ERs) in heart tissues upon stimulation with bacterial LPS, NG-R1 or some pharmacological inhibitors.Six hours after LPS administration (10 mg·kg(-1) , i.p.) cardiac function was decreased, an effect attenuated by NG-R1 pretreatment (25 mg·kg(-1) ·d(-1) , i.p.). NG-R1 also improved the imbalance between iNOS and eNOS, prevented activation of NF-κB and the subsequent myocardial inflammatory and apoptotic responses in endotoxemic mice. The effects of NG-R1 were closely associated with activation of the oestrogen receptor ERα and of PI3K/PKB (Akt) signalling, as characterized by NG-R1-induced preservation in ERα, phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK3β and I-κBα, and of cardiac function that was partially blocked by selective inhibitors of ERα or PI3K. However, NG-R1 had no effect on LPS-activated TLR-4.NG-R1 is a promising compound for protecting the heart from septic shock, possibly via the activation of ERα and PI3K/Akt signalling. This mechanism produces blockade of NF-κB activation and attenuation of the pro-inflammatory state and apoptotic stress in the myocardium."
2002,11841363,"Epidermal-dermal interactions regulate gelatinase activity in Apligraf, a tissue-engineered human skin equivalent.","Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) have important functions during skin development, repair and maintenance. MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinase A and gelatinase B) are involved in regulating keratinocyte migration.To analyse whether Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered human skin equivalent (HSE), produces gelatinases and TIMPs and whether or not epidermal-dermal interactions regulate MMP activity.The tissue distribution of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and fibronectin was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Secreted MMP activity was quantified by a fluorimetric assay and gelatin zymography was used to monitor gelatinases in tissue culture supernatants.Apligraf expressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 and contained immunohistochemically detectable amounts of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. The gelatinases were predominantly produced in the epidermis, whereas immunostaining of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was largely confined to the dermal component of the HSE. Fibronectin was expressed only in the dermis. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that intact Apligraf produced both MMP-2 and MMP-9, the latter predominantly in its latent form. Separation of the dermis from the epidermis resulted in an enhanced production and activation of MMP-9 by the epidermal layer, and secretion of latent and active MMP-2 by the dermal layer. Moreover, the incubation media of the separated epidermis demonstrated significantly stronger MMP activity than did intact Apligraf or its dermal component.These observations provide evidence that epidermal-dermal interactions suppress epidermal gelatinase activity. In addition, coexpression of TIMPs and fibronectin in the Apligraf dermis suggests that the product has the potential to counteract the imbalance between matrix production and degradation in chronic wounds and thus may support wound re-epithelialization."
2004,15158563,Pronounced induction of testicular PGF(2 alpha) and suppression of testosterone by cadmium-prevention by zinc.,"In order to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) on testicular prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) production, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CdCl(2) by subcutaneous injections. Dose-response as well as temporal-response experiments were performed, and PGF(2 alpha) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The highest cadmium dose (10 micromol/kg) caused a dramatic elevation of testicular PGF(2 alpha), which was established to occur 48 h after exposure. At this point of time, cadmium-treated animals displayed PGF(2 alpha) levels 16.7 times higher than saline-injected controls. No significant differences were found with the lower doses used (1 and 5 micromol/kg). In addition, the influence of pre-treatment with zinc (Zn) was assessed. The very strong stimulatory effect on PGF(2 alpha) synthesis (22.3-fold) detected after exposure to 20 micromol/kg cadmium, was completely absent in the group given zinc (1 mmol/kg) prior to cadmium exposure. Plasma testosterone concentrations were determined in the three experiments, and all groups with strongly elevated PGF(2 alpha) levels showed drastically lowered concentrations of testosterone. Zinc pre-treatment abolished not only the cadmium-induced rise in PGF(2 alpha) but also the testosterone reduction. Additionally, cadmium was found to inhibit the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which is responsible for the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. The present findings establish that cadmium can cause a strong induction of testicular PGF(2 alpha) production, which might help to explain the well-known antisteroidogenic effect of this heavy metal. Such an inhibitory effect could be due to reduced levels of StAR."
2014,24128557,Cereal foods are the major source of betaine in the Western diet--analysis of betaine and free choline in cereal foods and updated assessments of betaine intake.,"Betaine and its precursor choline are important components of one-carbon metabolism, remethylating homocysteine into methionine and providing methyl groups for DNA methylation. Cereals are the main source of betaine in the diet, though there is little literature available on the content of betaine in cereal products, nor on betaine intake from cereals. Betaine and free-choline concentrations were measured by liquid-chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in a wide range of commercially available cereal foods and cereal fractions. Whole grain wheat and related fractions were the best overall common source of betaine, while the pseudocereal quinoa had the highest amount of betaine measured (3900 μg/g). Based on estimates of dietary intake data cereal foods provide approximately 60-67% of betaine in Western diets, and 20-40% of betaine in South-East Asian diets. Average intake of betaine was 131 mg/d, well below those used in intervention studies using betaine to lower blood homocysteine."

2010,19772681,Orally administered glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius reduce acute inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis.,"Polysaccharides are one of the most potent mushroom-derived substances exhibiting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The aims of the present study were to determine whether orally administered glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius could attenuate or prevent the development of experimental colitis in mice. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by treatment with 3.5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 18 d. Before or after DSS administration, mice were given hot water solubles (HWS) or mycelium extract (ME) (2 or 20 mg per mouse) daily in their food. Colonic damage was macroscopically and histologically evaluated. Inflammation was assessed by changes in colon length, TNF-alpha levels released by colonic samples in organ culture and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in colonic samples were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. P. pulmonarius glucans attenuated and prevented the development of symptoms associated with DSS-induced colitis. High doses of HWS and ME blocked colon shortening, suppressed MPO activity and improved macroscopic score in all treatment groups. In addition, histological damage from colitis was reduced by HWS and ME at all doses. The tissue levels of TNF-alpha protein were significantly decreased and correlated with degree of inflammation and macroscopic score. All treatments significantly attenuated the increased DSS-mediated expression levels of IL-1beta. We conclude that the different glucan preparations (HWS or ME) harvested from P. pulmonarius when orally administered to DSS-treated mice attenuate the development of colonic inflammation, suggesting putative clinical utility for these extracts in the treatment of colitis."
2005,15695845,Quantification and speciation of mercury and selenium in fish samples of high consumption in Spain and Portugal.,"Mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) determinations were carried out to evaluate human exposure to those elements through fish consumption in Spain and Portugal. Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS) was applied in a cold vapor mode for total mercury quantification and was also hyphenated to gas chromatography (GC) to achieve the speciation of organomercurial species in fish samples. The results obtained show the highest concentration of Hg in swordfish and tuna (0.47+/-0.02 and 0.31+/-0.01 microg g-1, respectively), and a much lower concentration in sardine, mackerel shad, and octopus (0.048+/-0.002, 0.033+/-0.001, and 0.024+/-0.001 microg g-1, respectively). The determination of alkyl mercury compounds revealed that 93-98% of mercury in the fish samples was in the organic form. Methylmercury (MeHg) was the only species found in the three fish species with higher mercury content. Total selenium concentration was high in sardine, swordfish, and tuna (0.43+/-0.02, 0.47+/-0.02, and 0.92+/-0.01 microg g-1, respectively), but low in mackerel shad and octopus (0.26+/-0.01 and 0.13+/-0.01 microg g-1, respectively). Speciation of selenium compounds was done by high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS). Selenomethionine (SeMet) was the only selenium compound identified in the fish samples with higher selenium content. Among the fish species studied, sardine had the most favourable Se:Hg and SeMet:MeHg molar ratios; therefore, its consumption seems to be preferable."
2011,21532164,Effects of S/B remedy containing Scutellaria baicalensis and Bupleurum scorzonerifolfium on hepatic interleukin-6 related signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation in mice through cell-cell interaction.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in regulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) related growth control of the liver. Our previous study demonstrated that a mixture containing Scutellaria baicalensis and Bupleurum scorzonerifolfium (S/B remedy) modulated the growth of hepatocytes during liver regeneration after 2/3 partial hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether S/B remedy induced mouse hepatic STAT3 activation directly in hepatocytes or indirectly via non-parenchymal cell-hepatocyte interaction. Direct S/B remedy effects were studied using primarily isolated hepatocytes; while C57BL/6J mice were used to study indirect effects of S/B remedy using gadolinium chloride to deplete Kupffer cells' function. The results showed that S/B remedy and its active constituents did not directly activate growth-related signaling in primarily isolated hepatocytes. However, S/B remedy induced STAT3 and subsequently suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) activation in mouse liver and increased serum IL-6 level in a dose-dependent manner, which could be partially blocked by pretreatment with gadolinium chloride. Oligonucloetide microarray analysis from S/B remedy-treated peripheral blood leukocytes demonstrated an up-regulation of IL-6 gene expression. We conclude that S/B remedy did not directly induce STAT3 activation in vitro, but induced hepatic IL-6 related STAT3 activation through non-parenchymal cell-hepatocyte interaction in vivo. The results provide important information on the molecular mechanisms of S/B remedy for treatment of human liver diseases."
2015,25952883,Cranberries (Oxycoccus quadripetalus) inhibit lipid metabolism and modulate leptin and adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"It has previously been shown that lyophilized cranberries (LCB) decreased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and inhibited preadipocyte differentiation by down-regulation of the expression of key transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, SREBP1) of the adipogenesis pathway. To elucidate the molecular basis of anti-lipogenic activity of LCB, the expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin 1 (PLIN1), was examined in the present study. Additionally, the effects of LCB on adiponectin and leptin expression and protein secretion were also investigated. LCB reduced lipid accumulation during preadipocyte differentiation by down-regulation of the mRNA level of aP2, FAS, LPL, HSL and PLIN1. Moreover, LCB decreased leptin gene expression and increased adiponectin gene expression and protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore cranberries could be considered as bioactive factors, which are effective in the inhibition of adipose tissue mass production. "
2018,30176353,Epidemiology and molecular characterisation of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from immunocompromised patients in Tunisia.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the resistance determinants and genetic relatedness of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (ColR-Kp) isolates in the National Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Tunis (NBMTC) between 2002 and 2013. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for colistin of ColR-Kp isolates were assessed using a UMIC broth microdilution kit. All isolates were screened by PCR for the resistance genes mcr-1, blaCTX-M-1, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA-1, blaOXA-48, blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaGES, blaIMI and blaAmpC as well as class 1, 2 and 3 integrons. The clonality of ColR-Kp isolates was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A total of 24 non-duplicate ColR-Kp isolates were collected with MICs ranging from 16 mg/L to >64 mg/L, representing 3.4% (24/709) of the total K. pneumoniae isolates. The colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was not found. The blaSHV gene was present in all of the isolates, blaTEM in 18 isolates, blaCTX-M-1 and blaOXA-1 in 15 isolates each and blaCMY-16 in two isolates. The blaOXA-48 gene was found in five carbapenem-resistant isolates and was associated with blaCTX-M-1, blaSHV, blaTEM and blaOXA-1. All isolates were negative for the remaining carbapenemases. Class 1 integron was found in 19 isolates. PFGE showed non-clonal spread of ColR-Kp isolates in this center. The increasing rate of colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates in NBMTC was neither associated to clonal diffusion nor to the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1. Its association with the use of colistin in total digestive decolonization in transplant patients at NBMTC must be investigated."
2004,15081864,Inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by tanshinone IIA isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge.,"Osteoclasts, multinuclear cells specialized for bone resorption, differentiate from the monocyte/macrophage lineage of hematopoietic cells. Intervention in osteoclast differentiation is considered an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of bone diseases involving osteoclasts. In this study, we found that tanshinone IIA, originating from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. Addition of tanshinone IIA to the osteoclast precursor culture caused a significant decrease in the level of calcitonin receptor, c-Src, and integrin beta3 mRNA, which are normally upregulated during the osteoclast differentiation dependent on RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand). RANKL activated the ERK, Akt, and NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways in osteoclast precursor cells, and tanshinone IIA suppressed this activation. Tanshinone IIA also inhibited the bone resorptive activity of differentiated osteoclasts, which was accompanied with the disruption of the actin ring. Thus, tanshinone IIA has the potential to ameliorate bone-resorption diseases in vivo by reducing both the number and activity of osteoclasts."
2008,18709897,Efficacy of Canadian folic acid food fortification.,"Canada mandated that cereal grains, especially white flour, be fortified with folic acid by mid-1998. Between 0.1 and 0.2 mg of additional synthetic folic acid per day has been provided through this initiative. The current paper describes how this took place, and the epidemiological effects that occurred in the Canadian population, including higher blood folate levels and a decline in the prevalence of neural tube defects."
2018,30136914,Ginsenoside Rg3 Inhibition of Thyroid Cancer Metastasis Is Associated with Alternation of Actin Skeleton.,"Ginsenoside Rg3, a bioactive constituent from Panax ginseng, is a worldwide well-known traditional Chinese medicine used as a tonic. It also has good antitumor activity by inhibiting tumors metastasis. Tumor metastasis is a high risk in thyroid cancer. However, the effect and molecular mechanism underlying the antimetastatic activity of Rg3 in thyroid cancer have not been reported. In our study, we found that Rg3 inhibited the growth of thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo and significantly inhibited metastasis of thyroid cancer. Rg3 apparently inhibited the migration and invasion in four papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells (TPC-1, BCPAP, C643, and Ocut-2c cells) and pulmonary metastasis in lung metastasis model of C643 cells in nude mice. We further found that a possible mechanism of Rg3 inhibiting thyroid cancer cells metastasis was associated with inhibiting cells actin skeleton function. Rg3 inhibited lamellipodia formation and induced microspike formation by inhibiting Rho GTPase in thyroid cancer cells. Rg3 decreased the levels of Rac-1 and Cdc42 proteins. In addition, Rg3 decreased the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 proteins in four thyroid cancer cells. The results that Rg3 remarkably inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) protein in PTC cells and VEGF-A protein in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells and decreased the staining of CD31 in PTC and ATC tumors hinted that Rg3 might inhibit the lymph node metastasis in PTC and angiogenesis in ATC. These studies suggested that Rg3 might be a useful agent for the treatment of metastatic thyroid cancers."
2011,21553128,High serum zinc and serum testosterone levels were associated with excessive erythrocytosis in men at high altitudes.,"Chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a lack of adaptation to altitude characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (EE), is a health problem associated with life at high altitude. The erythropoietic process is regulated by both erythropoietin and testosterone. Zinc (Zn) is known to be related with testosterone and hemoglobin levels; meanwhile, nitric oxide was also associated with adaptation to high altitude. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of hemoglobin and CMS score with serum levels of zinc, total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (cFT), bioavailable testosterone (BAT), hemoglobin, and nitric oxide in men at high altitude with or without EE. Men residing in Lima (150 m) and Cerro de Pasco (4,340 m), Peru, were divided into three groups: (1) low altitude, (2) high altitude without EE (hemoglobin < 21 g/dl), and (3) high altitude with EE (hemoglobin ≥ 21 g/dl). Adjusted multivariable regression models showed that serum testosterone (total or free) and Zn levels were independently correlated with increased hemoglobin levels. Similarly, hemoglobin was positively related with signs/symptoms of CMS; however, both increased the serum Zn and the nitric oxide levels correlated with reduced risk for signs/symptoms of CMS. In conclusion, higher serum testosterone levels and Zn levels were associated with EE, and low scores of signs/symptoms of CMS were associated with higher Zn and nitric oxide levels."
2006,16903077,Effect of biochanin A on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cytochrome P450 1A1 in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells.,"Phytoestrogen biochanin A is an isoflavone derivative isolated from red clover Trifolium pratense with anticarcinogenic properties. This study examined the action of biochanin A with the carcinogen activation pathway that is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Treating the cells with biochanin A alone caused the accumulation of CYP1A1 mRNA and an increase in CYP1A1-specific 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in a dose dependent manner. A concomitant treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and biochanin A markedly reduced the DMBA-inducible EROD activity and CYP1A1 mRNA level. In addition, the biochanin A treatment alone activated the DNA-binding capacity of the AhR for the dioxin-response element (DRE) of CYP1A1, as measured by the electrophoretic-mobility shift assay (EMSA). EMSA revealed that biochanin A reduced the level of the DMBA-inducible AhR-DRE binding complex. Furthermore, biochanin A competed with the prototypical AhR ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), for binding to the AhR in an isolated rat cytosol. The biochanin A competitively inhibited the metabolic activation of DMBA, as measured by the formation of the DMBA-DNA adducts. These results suggest that biochanin A may thus be a natural ligand to bind on AhR. Therefore, biochanin A may be due to act an antagonist/agonist of the AhR pathway."
2018,29689254,Inhibitory Effects of Danshen components on CYP2C8 and CYP2J2.,"The use of Chinese herbal medicines and natural products has become increasingly popular in both China and Western societies as an alternative medicine for the treatment of diseases or as a health supplement. Danshen, the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Fam.Labiatae), which is rich in phenolic acids and tanshinones, is a widely used herbal medicine for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. The goal of this study was to examine the inhibitory effects of fifteen components derived from Danshen on CYP2C8 and CYP2J2, which are expressed both in human liver and cardiovascular systems. Recombinant CYP2C8 and CYP2J2 were used, and the mechanism, kinetics, and type of inhibition were determined. Taxol 6-hydroxylation and astemizole O-desmethyastemizole were determined as probe activities for CYP2C8 and CYP2J2, respectively. Metabolites formations were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results demonstrated that salvianolic acid A was a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Ki = 2.5 μM) and mixed-type inhibitor of CYP2J2 (Ki = 7.44 μM). Salvianolic acid C had moderate noncompetitive and mixed-type inhibitions on CYP2C8 (Ki = 4.82 μM) and CYP2J2 (Ki = 5.75 μM), respectively. Tanshinone IIA was a moderate competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Ki = 1.18 μM). Dihydrotanshinone I had moderate noncompetitive inhibition on CYP2J2 (Ki = 6.59 μM), but mechanism-based inhibition on CYP2C8 (KI = 0.43 μM, kinact = 0.097 min-1). Tanshinone I was a moderate competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Ki = 4.20 μM). These findings suggested that Danshen preparations appear not likely to pose a significant risk of drug interactions mediated by CYP2C8 after oral administration; but their inhibitory effects on intestinal CYP2J2 mediated drug metabolism should not be neglected when they are given orally in combination with other drugs. Additionally, this study provided novel insights into the underling pharmacological mechanisms of Danshen components from the perspective of CYP2C8 and CYP2J2 inhibition."
2016,26780749,Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: A Clinical Perspective on Trials of the Novel Oral Anticoagulants.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disturbance; its incidence increases with age, and it is also an independent risk factor for stroke. Anticoagulation has been proven as the most effective way to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF, and vitamin K antagonists have been used for decades as the gold standard treatment. Vitamin K antagonists have a narrow therapeutic window in addition to variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and they frequently interact with food and other drugs, requiring coagulation monitoring to ensure balance between safety and efficacy. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban selectively target either thrombin or Factor Xa and have predictable pharmacologic profiles, removing the need for routine coagulation monitoring. This article summarizes phase III data in patient subtypes and discusses controversies surrounding AF management with these agents. Results indicate that NOACs in non-valvular AF have an overall improved efficacy-safety profile compared with warfarin. Significantly fewer fatal bleeding events were observed in patients randomized to rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban compared with those on warfarin, and significant reductions in the incidence of life-threatening bleeding were observed in patients randomized to dabigatran. All four pivotal trials testing the NOACs against warfarin showed significantly lower rates of intracranial bleeding in patients administered NOACs. These results suggest that wider use of NOACs has the potential to improve outcomes for most patients with AF. "
2014,24968200,Beneficial effects of soluble dietary Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) in the prevention of the onset of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in high-fructose diet-fed rats.,"Jerusalem artichoke (JA) has the potential to attenuate lipid disturbances and insulin resistance (IR), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we elucidated the physiological responses and mechanisms of JA intervention with a comprehensive transcriptome analysis. Wistar rats were fed a control diet, a 60 % fructose-enriched diet (FRU), or a FRU with 10 % JA (n 6-7) for 4 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test was carried out on day 21. Liver samples were collected for biochemical and global gene expression analyses (GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array, Affymetrix). Fructose feeding resulted in IR and hepatic TAG accumulation; dietary JA supplementation significantly improved these changes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the expression of malic enzyme 1 (Me1), associated with fatty acid synthesis; decorin (Dcn), related to fibrosis; and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 2 (Cyp1a2) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), associated with inflammation, was differentially altered by the FRU, whereas dietary JA supplementation significantly improved the expression of these genes. We established for the first time the molecular mechanisms driving the beneficial effects of JA in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We propose that 10 % JA supplementation may be beneficial for the prevention of the onset of these diseases."
2006,16618015,"Efficacy and safety of a combination of sabal and urtica extract in lower urinary tract symptoms. A randomized, double-blind study versus tamsulosin.","The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of PRO 160/120 (Prostagutt forte), a fixed combination preparation of 160 mg Sabal fruit extract WS 1473 and 120 mg Urtica root extract WS 1031 per capsule, in comparison to the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin (CAS 106463-17-6) in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 140 elderly out-patients suffering from LUTS caused by BPH, with an initial score > or = 13 points in the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), received 2 x 1 capsule/d PRO 160/120 or 1 x 0.4 mg/d tamsulosin and were treated for 60 weeks with interim visits at weeks 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the change in I-PSS total score, the percentage of patients with an I-PSS score < or = 7 points at endpoint ('responders') was analyzed as well. During 60 weeks of randomized treatment the I-PSS total score was reduced by a median of 9 points in both groups. In total, 32.4 % of the patients in the PRO 160/120 group and 27.9% in the tamsulosin group were responders (test for non-inferiority of PRO 160/120: p = 0.034; non-inferiority margin 10%). Both drugs were well tolerated, with one adverse event in 1514 treatment days for PRO 160/120 and one event in 1164 days for tamsulosin. The study supports non-inferiority of PRO 160/120 in comparison to tamsulosin in the treatment of LUTS caused by BPH."
2013,23923608,Ameliorative effect of Luffa acutangula Roxb. on doxorubicin induced cardiac and nephrotoxicity in mice.,"The present study reports protective effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of Luffa acutangula (HAELA) on doxorubicin (DXR) induced cardio and nephrotoxicity in mice by studying various serum biomarkers, antioxidants in target organs and histoarchitecture alterations. Pretreatment with HAELA reversed significantly the elevated serum biomarkers, alanine amino transferase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase in heart and kidney in DXR treated mice. In addition, HAELA treatment inhibited elevated malondialdehyde formation and restored the depleted glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase in heart and kidney tissue. The altered histoarchitecture of heart and kidney tissue due to DXR treatment were also improved with HAELA. The protective activity observed with HAELA on DXR induced cardio and nephrotoxicity in mice was found to be related to its antioxidant property which finally results in membrane stabilization."
2003,12767692,Inhibition of glycyrrhizic acid on aflatoxin B1-induced cytotoxicity in hepatoma cells.,"Aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) causes oxidative stress and ROS formation via metabolic activation of AFB(1). Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) has been reported to have antioxidative properties. The present study was to investigate the effect of GA, a major component of licorice on AFB(1)-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). GA displayed protective effects against AFB(1) treatment. Both CYP1A1, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were increased in cells after treatment with the GA, while CYP1A2 did not seem to be affected by GA. For cells without GA pre-treatment, cell injury was implicated as indicated by the decrease in cell viability. The time-course study of GA showed pretreatment of cells with GA for 24 h was effective. The treatment of cells with GA and AFB(1) enhanced the detoxifying enzyme activity. The pre-treatment of cells with GA provides protective effects in terms of the enzyme activity and increase in cell viability. The results suggest that GA protects against aflatoxin-induced oxidative stress. This may contribute to its anticarcinogenic capability. The protective effect is likely due to its capacity to inhibit the metabolic activation of hepato-toxin, a critical factor in the pathogenesis of chemical-induced carcinogenicity."
2018,29710551,Saponins from Panax notoginseng leaves improve the symptoms of aplastic anemia and aberrant immunity in mice.,"Aplastic anemia (AA) is usually treated with immunosuppressive agents, but their efficacy and safety are not satisfactory. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) promote the proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. This study aimed to examine the effects of leaf PNS (LPNS) on hematopoiesis and T cells in mouse models of AA. The experiments were performed in normal mice and AA mice (controls, cyclosporine, and low, medium, and high doses of LPNS). Hematopoietic cells were counted using colony formation assays. The proportions of T cells were measured by flow cytometry. The ERK1/2, T-bet, GATA-3, FOXP3, and RORγ proteins were assessed by western blotting. Cytokines were measured using a cytometric bead array. AA mice showed impaired hematopoiesis, high activation of T cells, and decreased expression of T-bet, GATA-3, and FOXP3. LPNS attenuated the inflammation observed in AA mice, and significantly increased the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The proportions of Th2 and regulatory T cells and the protein levels of P-ERK1/2, GATA-3, and FOXP3 were increased in the AA + LPNS mice compared with the AA mice. In contrast, LPNS decreased the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells and the protein expression of T-bet. LPNS and cyclosporine had similar effects, but of different amplitudes. These results suggest that LPNS have dual activities in AA: 1) promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells; and 2) modulating T cell immune functions, an activity similar to that of cyclosporine. Additional studies are necessary to confirm those results before clinical use."
2008,18364330,Co-existing micronutrient deficiencies among stunted Cambodian infants and toddlers.,"The prevalence of malnutrition in Cambodia is among the highest in Southeast Asia, and diarrhea and pneumonia are the leading causes of death among children. Whether these adverse health outcomes are associated with co-existing micronutrient deficiencies is uncertain. We have determined the prevalence of anaemia, as well as iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiency and their co-existence among stunted children (77 females; 110 males) aged 6-36 mos. Non-fasting morning venipuncture blood samples were taken and analyzed for haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (via IMx system), retinol (via HPLC), and Zn (via AAS), C-reactive protein (CRP) (via turbidimetry) and Hb type (AA, AE, or EE) (via Hb gel electrophoresis). Children with CRP>or=5.0 mg/L (n=34) were excluded. Zinc deficiency defined as serum Zn<9.9 micromol/L had the highest prevalence (73.2%), followed by anaemia (71%) (Hb<110 g/L), and then vitamin A deficiency (28.4%) (serum retinol<0.70 micromol/L). Of the anaemic children, only 21% had iron deficiency anaemia, and 6% had depleted iron stores. Age, log serum ferritin, and Hb type were significant predictors of Hb in the AA and AE children. Serum retinol was unrelated to haemoglobin or serum zinc. The prevalence of two or more micronutrient deficiencies (low Hb, serum retinol, and/or serum zinc) was 44%. Nearly 10% had low values for all three indices, and 18% had just one low value. In conclusion, anaemia, and deficiencies of iron, zinc, and vitamin A are severe public health problems among these stunted Cambodian children. Intervention strategies addressing multiple micronutrient deficiencies are needed."
2008,17927845,Inhibition of platelet aggregation by olive oil phenols via cAMP-phosphodiesterase.,"The aim of the present study was to confirm that olive oil phenols reduce human platelet aggregability and to verify the hypothesis that cAMP- and cGMP- phosphodiesterases (PDE) could be one of the targets of the biological effect. Four extracts from oils characterized by a high phenol content (HPE), and low phenol levels (LPE) were prepared and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by HPLC-UV and electrospray ionization-MS/MS. Human washed platelets stimulated with thrombin were used for the aggregation assay. Human platelet cAMP-PDE and recombinant PDE5A1 were used as enzyme source. Platelet aggregation and enzyme activity were assayed in the presence of HPE, LPE and individual phenols. The phenol content of HPE ranged between 250 and 500 mg/kg, whereas the LPE content was 46 mg/kg. The compounds identified were hydroxytyrosol (HT), tyrosol (TY), oleuropein aglycone (OleA) and the flavonoids quercetin (QU), luteolin (LU) and apigenin (AP). OleA was the most abundant phenol (range 23.3 to 37.7 %) and LU was the most abundant flavonoid in the extracts. Oil extracts inhibited platelet aggregation with an 50% inhibitory concentration interval of 1.23-11.2 microg/ml. The inhibitory effect of individual compounds (10 microm) including homovanillyl alcohol (HVA) followed this order: OleA>LU>HT = TY = QU = HVA, while AP was inactive. All the extracts inhibited cAMP-PDE, while no significant inhibition of PDE5A1 (50 microg/ml) was observed. All the flavonoids and OleA inhibited cAMP-PDE, whereas HT, TY, HVA (100 microm) were inactive. Olive oil extracts and part of its phenolic constituents inhibit platelet aggregation; cAMP-PDE inhibition is one mechanism through which olive oil phenols inhibit platelet aggregation."
2006,16021489,Curcuminoids purified from turmeric powder modulate the function of human multidrug resistance protein 1 (ABCC1).,"Multidrug resistance is a major cause of chemotherapy failure in cancer patients. One of the resistance mechanisms is the overexpression of drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, (ABCC1)). In this study, curcumin mixture and three major curcuminoids purified from turmeric (curcumin I, II, and III) were tested for their ability to modulate the function of MRP1 using HEK293 cells stably transfected with MRP1-pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1 vector alone. The IC(50) of curcuminoids in these cell lines ranged from 14.5-39.3 microM. Upon treating the cells with etoposide in the presence of 10 microM curcuminoids, the sensitivity of etoposide was increased by several folds only in MRP1 expressing and not in pcDNA3.1-HEK 293 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the total cellular level of MRP1 protein level was not affected by treatment with 10 microM curcuminoids for three days. The modulatory effect of curcuminoids on MRP1 function was confirmed by the inhibition of efflux of two fluorescent substrates, calcein-AM and fluo4-AM. Although all the three curcuminoids increased the accumulation of fluorescent substrates in a concentration-dependent manner, curcumin I was the most effective inhibitor. In addition, curcuminoids did not affect 8-azido[alpha-(32)P]ATP binding, however they did stimulate the basal ATPase activity and inhibited the quercetin-stimulated ATP hydrolysis of MRP1 indicating that these bioflavonoids interact most likely at the substrate-binding site(s). In summary, these results demonstrate that curcuminoids effectively inhibit MRP1-mediated transport and among curcuminoids, curcumin I, a major constituent of curcumin mixture, is the best modulator."
2007,17541172,Inhibitory effect of schizandrin on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and scratching behaviors in mice.,"To evaluate the antiallergic effect of the fruit of Schizandra chinensis Baill (Family Magnoliaceae), which inhibited the mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in a preliminary experiment, its main constituent, schizandrin, was isolated and its antiallergic effect investigated. Schizandrin inhibited the PCA reaction induced by the IgE-antigen complex, the scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80 and the serum IgE production induced by ovalbumin. Schizandrin also inhibited the in vitro degranulation of compound 48/80-induced rat peritoneal mast cells and IgE-induced RBL 2H3 cells. Schizandrin reduced the protein expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in IgE-induced RBL 2H3 cells. These findings suggest that schizandrin can improve IgE-induced anaphylaxis and scratching behaviors."
2014,25069039,Critical roles for nitric oxide and ERK in the completion of prosurvival autophagy in 4OHTAM-treated estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.,"Autophagy is a mechanism of tamoxifen (TAM) resistance in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. In this study, we showed in ER+ MCF7 cells that 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHTAM) induced cellular nitric oxide (NO) that negatively regulates cellular superoxide (O2-) and cytotoxicity. 4OHTAM stimulated LC3 lipidation and formation of monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-labeled autophagic vesicles dependent on O2-. Depletion of NO increased O2- and LC3 lipidation, yet reduced formation of MDC-labeled autophagic vesicles. Instead, NO-depleted cells formed remarkably large vacuoles with rims decorated by LC3. The vacuoles were not labeled by MDC or the acidic lysosome-specific fluorescence dye acridine orange (AO). The vacuoles were increased by the late stage autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, which also increased LC3 lipidation. These results suggest NO is required for proper autophagic vesicle formation or maturation at a step after LC3 lipidation. In addition, 4OHTAM induced O2--dependent activation of ERK, inhibition of which destabilized lysosomes/autolysosomes upon 4OHTAM treatment and together with depletion of NO led to necrotic cell death. These results suggest an essential role for endogenous NO and ERK activation in the completion of pro-survival autophagy. "
2012,22632166,Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 promotes invasion and bone metastasis of small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.,"Bone is one of the most frequent targets of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) metastasis and is closely associated with a poor prognosis, but the specific cellular gene alterations responsible for SCLC with bone metastasis are unclear. Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) as an E-box transcriptional repressor has been suggested that an important inducer of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a promoter of tumor metastasis in colon, breast and lung cancers. However, the relationship between ZEB1 and SCLC with bone metastasis is unclear. In this study, ZEB1 was found to be highly expressed in bone-metastatic SCLC tissues and cell lines as compared with those that were non-metastatic (P < 0.05). Using a lentivirus RNA interference technique to knockdown ZEB1 expression in bone-metastatic SCLC cells (SBC-5 cell line), we found that ZEB1 siRNA could inhibit the invasive and migratory ability and decrease parathyroid hormone-related protein expression, as determined by invasion assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Besides, ZEB1 siRNA significantly inhibited the bone metastasis of SBC-5 cells in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of ZEB1 in SBC-3 cells, which demonstrate promoted bone-metastatic potential, dramatically promoted their invasive and migratory ability and parathyroid hormone-related protein expression as well as increased the number and sites of bone metastases in vivo compare to the control group. We also found that SBC-3 cells underwent EMT, as indicated by decreased epithelial markers and increased mesenchymal marker expression. Taken together, these results indicate that ZEB1 promoted the invasive ability and bone metastasis of SCLC cells, and that this was partially mediated via the EMT pathway."
2017,28369685,"Isorhapontigenin, a bioavailable dietary polyphenol, suppresses airway epithelial cell inflammation through a corticosteroid-independent mechanism.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a corticosteroid-resistant airway inflammatory condition. Resveratrol exhibits anti-inflammatory activities in COPD but has weak potency and poor pharmacokinetics. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of isorhapontigenin, another dietary polyphenol, as a novel anti-inflammatory agent for COPD by examining its effects in vitro and pharmacokinetics in vivo.Primary human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy and COPD subjects, and A549 epithelial cells were incubated with isorhapontigenin or resveratrol and stimulated with IL-1β in the presence or absence of cigarette smoke extract. Effects of isorhapontigenin and resveratrol on the release of IL-6 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and the activation of NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), MAPKs and PI3K/Akt/FoxO3A pathways were determined and compared with those of dexamethasone. The pharmacokinetic profiles of isorhapontigenin, after i.v. or oral administration, were assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats.Isorhapontigenin concentration-dependently inhibited IL-6 and CXCL8 release, with IC50 values at least twofold lower than those of resveratrol. These were associated with reduced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and, notably, the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3A pathway, that was relatively insensitive to dexamethasone. In vivo, isorhapontigenin was rapidly absorbed with abundant plasma levels after oral dosing. Its oral bioavailability was approximately 50% higher than resveratrol.Isorhapontigenin, an orally bioavailable dietary polyphenol, displayed superior anti-inflammatory effects compared with resveratrol. Furthermore, it suppressed the PI3K/Akt pathway that is insensitive to corticosteroids. These favourable efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties support its further development as a novel anti-inflammatory agent for COPD."
2018,29670330,"The efficacy and safety of Ginkgo biloba extract as an adjuvant in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients ineffectively managed with metformin: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major diseases confronting the health care systems. In diabetes mellitus (DM), combined use of oral hypoglycemic medications has been shown to be more effective than metformin (Met) alone in glycemic control. This study determined the effects of Ginkgo biloba (GKB) extract as an adjuvant to Met in patients with uncontrolled T2DM.Sixty T2DM patients were recruited in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and multicenter trial. The patients, currently using Met, were randomly grouped into those treated with either GKB extract (120 mg/day) or placebo (starch, 120 mg/day) for 90 days. Blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting serum glucose, serum insulin, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), insulin resistance, and visceral adiposity index (VAI) were determined before (baseline) and after 90 days of GKB extract treatment.GKB extract significantly decreased blood HbA1c (7.7%±1.2% vs baseline 8.6%±1.6%, P<0.001), fasting serum glucose (154.7±36.1 mg/dL vs baseline 194.4±66.1 mg/dL, P<0.001) and insulin (13.4±7.8 μU/mL vs baseline 18.5±8.9 μU/mL, P=0.006) levels, BMI (31.6±5.1 kg/m2 vs baseline 34.0±6.0 kg/m2, P<0.001), waist WC (102.6±10.5 cm vs baseline 106.0±10.9 cm, P<0.001), and VAI (158.9±67.2 vs baseline 192.0±86.2, P=0.007). GKB extract did not negatively impact the liver, kidney, or hematopoietic functions.GKB extract as an adjuvant was effective in improving Met treatment outcomes in T2DM patients. Thus, it is suggested that GKB extract is an effective dietary supplement for the control of DM in humans."
2000,10906423,Antioxidant effect of onion oil (Allium cepa. Linn) on the damages induced by nicotine in rats as compared to alpha-tocopherol.,"The beneficial effects of onion oil as an antioxidant has been assessed in nicotine administered rats by studying whether the peroxidative damage caused by nicotine can be effectively combated with the onion oil and the effects compared to vitamin E, a highly efficient antioxidant. Lipid peroxidation products and antioxidant defence system have been studied in liver, lungs, and heart. The rats were injected with nicotine (0.6 mg/kg body wt.) and simultaneously given onion oil (100 mg/kg body wt.) or vitamin E (100 mg/kg body wt.) for 21 days. Concentration of free fatty acids, TBA reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides were significantly increased in the tissues of nicotine treated rats as compared to normal rats. Onion oil supplemented to nicotine treated rats showed increased resistance to lipid peroxidation and the effect was near to that of vitamin E fed rats. The activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase decreased in nicotine treated rats. Antioxidants-glutathione content, vitamin C and retinol showed no significant difference but liver vitamin E content significantly decreased in nicotine treated rats. On onion oil or vitamin E supplementation, the concentration of antioxidants were significantly raised in all the tissues studied, however, a significantly increased concentration of glutathione, vitamin E and retinol was noticed in vitamin E+nicotine treated rats. Thus, these results indicate that onion oil is an effective antioxidant against the oxidative damage caused by nicotine as compared to vitamin E."
1996,8686816,Propofol infusion anaesthesia and the immune response in elderly patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery.,"In our earlier studies, propofol infusion anaesthesia increased the percentage of T helper cells in middle-aged surgical patients undergoing minor or major surgery. In the present study we compared the effects of total intravenous propofol anaesthesia and combined isoflurane anaesthesia on the immune response to ophthalmic surgery in elderly patients. Twenty patients (median age 75 years, ASA 2-3) were randomly allocated to receive total intravenous propofol anaesthesia (median total dose of propofol 710 mg) or combined isoflurane anaesthesia (median end-expiratory concentration of isoflurane 0.45 vol %). The following were measured pre-operatively, at the end of operation and on the first postoperative morning: leucocyte and differential counts: percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD16) and monocytes (CD14); phytohaemagglutinin-, concanavalin A- and pokeweed mitogen-induced and unstimulated lymphocyte proliferative responses: polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis as well as serum cortisol concentrations. The immune response to ophthalmic surgery was basically similar in both anaesthetic groups. The percentage of T helper cells in the blood circulation increased in the propofol group (p < 0.05) but not in the isoflurane group. The difference in the time-response profile for T helper cell percentages between the groups was also statistically significant (p < 0.01)."
1994,7840566,Effect of lactation on single-dose pharmacokinetics of norfloxacin nicotinate in ewes.,"In a three-way crossover trial, six healthy Finnish-Merino-Awassi ewes were given a single intravenous injection of norfloxacin nicotinate (in a dose equivalent to 25 mg of norfloxacin base per kg of body weight) during nursing, 1 day after weaning, and 1 month after weaning. Blood and milk samples were collected at different time intervals following dosing, and norfloxacin concentrations were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The serum drug concentration versus time data were analyzed by a noncompartmental approach which was based on the statistical-moment theory. The total body clearance values were 4.2 +/- 1.3 (injection during nursing), 1.6 +/- 0.3 (injection 1 day after weaning), and 3.1 +/- 0.8 ml/min/kg (injection 1 month after weaning). The mean residence times were 335 +/- 83, 797 +/- 129, and 481 +/- 102 min and terminal half-lives were 266 +/- 51, 603 +/- 94, and 372 +/- 68 min for the respective treatments. The estimated volumes of distribution at steady state were 1.3 +/- 0.1, 1.2 +/- 0.1, and 1.4 +/- 0.2 liter/kg for the respective treatments. Milk norfloxacin concentrations were up to 40 times higher than the corresponding concentrations in serum during lactation. Accordingly, in ewes with 1.5 liter of milk in the udder more than half of the drug in the animal appeared to be in the milk. Therapeutic concentrations of norfloxacin could be detected in the sera of suckling lambs, implicating that fluoroquinolone therapy should be discouraged during breast feeding. In lactating ewes and in ewes with full udders, moment analysis calculations did not show a significant difference between the system moment mean residence time and the system matrix mean residence time values. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of norfloxacin in the three groups could be described by the classical two-compartment open-body model with input and output occurring from the central compartment. The results did not support the existence of a distinguishable milk compartment. Milk secretion seemed to act as one of the clearance processes of the drug when milk was continuously removed."
2011,21881242,The ameliorative effect of 23-hydroxytormentic acid isolated from Rubus coreanus on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.,"Previously, the authors demonstrated that the triterpenoid glycoside niga-ichigoside F₁ (NIF₁) and its aglycone 23-hydroxytormentic acid (23-HTA) isolated from the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus (Rosaceae) ameliorate cisplatin-induced toxicity in renal epithelial LLC-PK₁ cells. In the present study, the nephroprotective effects of NIF₁ and 23-HTA were investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats with acute renal injury induced by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cisplatin (7 mg/kg). Pretreatment with 23-HTA (10 mg/kg/d, per os (p.o.)) significantly reduced cisplatin-induced elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine level, whereas NIF₁ (10 mg/kg, p.o.) slightly reduced these levels. In addition, pretreatment with 23-HTA prevented cisplatin-induced hydroxyl radical generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, glutathione (GSH) depletion, and cisplatin-induced changes in the activities of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes in rat renal tissues. In addition, histopathological examinations showed that 23-HTA pretreatment reduced cisplatin-induced acute tubular necrosis and histological changes. In contrast, NIF₁ was found to have a slight or no influence on cisplatin-induced oxidative enzymes and acute tubular necrosis. Taken together, these results suggest that protective effect of 23-HTA pretreatment on cisplatin-induced renal damage is associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress and the preservation of antioxidant enzymes."
1993,24352104,Motor effects of broad beans (Vicia faba) in Parkinson's disease: single dose studies.,"Broad beans (Vicia faba) are a natural source of L-dopa. To investigate a possible role for this substance in the treatment of Parkinsonian motor oscillations, we carried out single dose studies of Vicia faba pod mixture plus carbidopa in six patients. Motor responses of equivalent magnitude to those of conventional L-dopa medication occurred in five cases with mean onset of 39 min and mean duration of 104 min. Vicia faba meals produced comparable L-dopa blood levels to fasting standard tablet doses and recovery studies yielded 0.25% L-dopa per weight of bean pod mixture. Vicia faba contains sufficient L-dopa to be pharmacologically active in patients with Parkinson's disease and can potentially be incorporated into dietary strategies to manage Parkinsonian motor oscillations.

2007,17409520,Induction of apoptosis by buckwheat trypsin inhibitor in chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells.,"Buckwheat is an ancient and specialty grain in China. Due to its unique chemical and bio-activity components, buckwheat has been found to have many uses in food products and medicine. However, very little is known about the toxicity of protease inhibitors from buckwheat. Here, the possible effects of a recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (rBTI) on the induction of apoptosis of the human K562 cell line were investigated by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and flow cytometric analysis. MTT assay showed that rBTI could specifically inhibit the growth of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but there were minimal effects on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, comparison the effects of rBTI on K562 cells with those of negative control (BSA and the complex of BSA and rBTI) revealed that rBTI was highly toxic to K562 cells, and BSA hardly had any inhibition on proliferation in K562 cells. The analysis of flow cytometric indicated that the apoptosis of K562 cells were 31.0%, 32.8%, 35.3% and 52.1% after treated by rBTI in range of 12.5-100 microg/ml, respectively. The results suggested that rBTI can induce apoptosis of K562 cells and that it might be a potential protein drug of the trypsin inhibitor family."
2014,24423503,Development of an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide modified disposable bismuth film electrode and its application for stripping analysis of heavy metals in milk.,"A novel electrochemical sensing platform based on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide film modified screen-printed electrode was developed. This disposable electrode shows excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. By in situ plating bismuth film, the developed electrode exhibited well-defined and separate stripping peaks for cadmium and lead. Several parameters, including electrolytes environment and electrodeposition conditions, were carefully optimized to achieve best stripping performance. The linear range for both metal ions at the disposable bismuth film electrode was from 1.0 μg L(-1) to 60.0 μg L(-1). The detection limit was 0.5 μg L(-1) for cadmium ion and 0.8 μg L(-1) for lead ion. Milk sample analysis demonstrates that the developed electrode could be effectively used to detect low levels (μg L(-1)) of cadmium ion and lead ion. Graphene based disposable bismuth film electrode is a sensitive, stable, and reliable sensing platform for heavy metals determination."
2015,25850566,Flaxseed reduces the pro-carcinogenic micro-environment in the ovaries of normal hens by altering the PG and oestrogen pathways in a dose-dependent manner.,"The objective of the present study was to find the optimum dose of flaxseed that would decrease PG and alter oestrogen pathway endpoints implicated in ovarian cancer. In the study, four groups of fifty 1.5-year-old chickens were fed different amounts of flaxseed (0, 5, 10 or 15% of their total diet) for 4 months and were then killed to collect blood and tissues. Levels of flaxseed lignan metabolites, Enterolactone (EL) and Enterodiol (ED) were measured in the serum, liver and ovaries by liquid chromatography-MS/MS, and n-3 and n-6 fatty acid (FA) levels were measured by GC. The effects of the varied flaxseed doses were assessed by measuring levels of PGE2 and oestrogen metabolites (16-hydroxyestrone (16-OHE1) and 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1)) as well as by analysing the expression of the oestradiol metabolising enzymes CYP3A4 (cytochrome p450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4), CYP1B1 (cytochrome p450, family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1) and CYP1A1 (cytochrome p450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) and that of oestrogen receptor α (ERα) in the ovaries. The ratio of n-3:n-FA increased with an increase in flaxseed supplementation and corresponded to a dose-dependent decrease in cyclo-oxygenase-2 protein and PGE2 levels. EL and ED increased in the serum, liver and ovaries with increased concentrations of flaxseed. Flaxseed decreased the expression of ERα in the ovaries. The ratio of 2-OHE1:16-OHE1 in the serum increased significantly in the 15% flaxseed diet, and there was a corresponding increase in CYP1A1 in the liver and decrease in CYP3A4 in the ovaries. CYP1B1 mRNA also decreased with flaxseed diet in the ovaries. The 15% flaxseed-supplemented diet significantly decreased inflammatory PGE2, ERα, CYP3A4, CYP1B1 and 16-OHE1, but it increased CYP1A1 and 2-OHE1, which thus reduced the inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic micro-environment of the ovaries."
2019,31006463,Physico-chemical and functional properties of silver carp myosin glycated with konjac oligo-glucomannan: Effects of deacetylation.,"The glycation of silver carp myosin (Ms) with konjac oligo-glucomannan (KOG) of different degrees of deacetylation (DD) was investigated. As DD increased, the physico-chemical and functional properties of glycoconjugates changed. The available lysine content decreased, while grafting degree and total sulfhydryl group increased, andmeanwhile, the isoelectric point (pI) reduced. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that glycation can be promoted as the increase of DD. The solubility increased significantly both in 0.1 M and 0.5 M NaCl solution, and the thermal stability increased when heated for 60 min at 80 °C. The emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsifying stability index (ESI) increased as well. These results showed that the highly deacetylated KOG (DKOG) was easier to glycate with myosin, leading to a great improvement in functional properties of myosin. It can be suggested that the reduction in steric hindrance of DKOG as a result of removal of acetyl groups facilitated the glycation."
2010,20211292,Apixaban for reduction in stroke and other ThromboemboLic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial: design and rationale.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of stroke that can be attenuated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Vitamin K antagonist use is limited, in part, by the high incidence of complications when patients' international normalized ratios (INRs) deviate from the target range. The primary objective of ARISTOTLE is to determine if the factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, is noninferior to warfarin at reducing the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism in patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. We have randomized 18,206 patients from over 1,000 centers in 40 countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive apixaban or warfarin using a double-blind, double-dummy design. International normalized ratios are monitored and warfarin (or placebo) is adjusted aiming for a target INR range of 2 to 3 using a blinded, encrypted point-of-care device. Minimum treatment is 12 months, and maximum expected exposure is 4 years. Time to accrual of at least 448 primary efficacy events will determine treatment duration. The key secondary objectives are to determine if apixaban is superior to warfarin for the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, and for all-cause death. These will be tested after the primary objective using a closed test procedure. The noninferiority boundary is 1.38; apixaban will be declared noninferior if the 95% CI excludes the possibility that the primary outcome rate with apixaban is >1.38 times higher than with warfarin. ARISTOTLE will determine whether apixaban is noninferior or superior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism; whether apixaban has particular benefits in the warfarin-naïve population; whether it reduces the combined rate of stroke, systemic embolism, and death; and whether it impacts bleeding."
2020,31434027,Baking performance of 25 edible dry bean powders: Correlation between cookie quality and rapid test indices.,"This study was designed to evaluate the baking performances of 25 edible dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties and to investigate correlations among cookie features and rapid test indices (i.e., water and lactic acid retention capacities, oil binding capacity and Rapid Visco Analyzer indices). Two bean powder particle sizes (≤0.5 mm, ≤1.0 mm) were investigated. Cookies were evaluated in terms of nutritional, geometrical and textural properties. Bean powders doubled the amount of cookie protein and increased cookie resistant starch content. Baking potential varied according to bean genotype and powder particle size: coarse powders resulted in larger (+26%) and thinner (-19%) cookies characterized by easier breaking texture (fracture strengths of 41-157 vs. 48-226 kPa for fine powders). Water retention and oil binding capacities and pasting properties significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with cookie features. In conclusion, these accumulated findings can be used in designing value-added traditional and gluten-free cookies."
2014,23981542,Resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory cytokines from human bronchial smooth muscle cells exposed to lipoteichoic acid in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"During bacterial infections, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induce cytokine/chemokine release in immunoactive cells. This increases corticosteroid-resistant airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and leads to exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory therapies other than corticosteroids are required and resveratrol is currently under discussion. Resveratrol is an activator of sirtuins, which are class III histone deacetylases (HDACs). We suggested that human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) release COPD-associated cytokines/chemokines in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major PAMP of gram-positive bacteria and that resveratrol is superior to the corticosteroid dexamethasone in suppressing these cytokines/chemokines. Cultivated HASMCs of patients with COPD were pre-incubated with resveratrol or dexamethasone before stimulation with LTA. CCL2, GM-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 were analysed in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Drug effects were investigated in the absence and presence of trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of class I/II HDACs, and EX527, an inhibitor of the sirtuin SIRT1. LTA induced robust cytokine/chemokine release. Resveratrol was superior to dexamethasone in reducing CCL-2, IL-6 and IL-8 in LTA-exposed HASMCs of patients with COPD. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing GM-CSF. Resveratrol effects were partially reversed by EX527 but not by TSA. Dexamethasone effects were partially reversed by TSA but not by EX527. We conclude that HASMCs contribute to the increase in airway inflammation in COPD exacerbations caused by gram-positive bacterial infections. Our data suggest resveratrol as an alternative anti-inflammatory therapy in infection-induced COPD exacerbations. Resveratrol and corticosteroids suppress cytokine/chemokine expression through activation of SIRT1 or interaction with class I/II HDACs, respectively, in HASMCs. "
2014,25164033,Ameliorative effect of resveratrol against fluoride-induced alteration of thyroid function in male wistar rats.,"Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenol and well-known natural antioxidant has been evaluated for its protective effect against fluoride-induced metabolic dysfunctions in rat thyroid gland. Fluoride, the most abundant anions present in groundwater throughout the world, creates a major problem in safe drinking water and causes metabolic, structural, and functional injuries in different organ systems. Sub-acute exposure to sodium fluoride at a dose of 20 mg/kg b.w./day orally to rat for 30 days induces thyroidal dysfunction including suppressed synthetic machinery of the thyroid gland to produce nucleic acids and thyroid hormones, mainly T3 and T4. Other functional changes are alteration of certain metabolic enzyme activities like Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, thyroid peroxidase, and 5,5'-deiodinase. Structural abnormality of thyroid follicles by fluoride intoxication clearly indicates its thyrotoxic manifestation. Resveratrol supplementation in fluoride-exposed animals appreciably prevented metabolic toxicity caused by fluoride and restored both functional status and ultra-structural organization of the thyroid gland towards normalcy. This study first establishes the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol as a natural antioxidant in thyroprotection against toxic insult caused by fluoride."
2018,30372910,Metabolic impairments and tissue disorders in alloxan-induced diabetic rats are alleviated by Salvia officinalis L. essential oil.,"The current research explored for the first time the effect of Salvia officinalis L. (Sage) essential oil (EO) on Alloxan-induced diabetes in male Wistar rats. Sage EO was extracted by a Clevenger apparatus and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. The most important chemical families identified in this oil were oxygenated monoterpenes (56.32%), hydrocarbon monoterpenes (15.00%) and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (14.70%). All treatments were administered orally. In vitro investigation showed that the EO had α-amylase and lipase inhibitory activities with IC50 = 38 μg/mL and IC50 = 52 μg/mL, respectively. In vivo experiments highlighted that the activities of serum α-amylase and lipase were reduced by 46.6% and 32.1%, respectively. Sage EO reduced glycemia by 60% and the level of glycogen stored in the liver by 43.7%. Treatments of diabetes with Sage EO significantly protected the liver function by lowering serum AST (35%), ALT (79%) and LDH (43%) activities. Furthermore, Sage EO was efficient to preserve the kidney function in diabetes by reverting back serum creatinine (47%) and UA (62.5%) concentrations to control values. The obtained results altogether evidenced that Sage EO had hypoglycemic and anti-obesity effects and could be a valuable complement in future diabetes therapy."
2010,20657266,"Amelioration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced behavioural dysfunction and oxidative stress by Pycnogenol in mouse model of Parkinson's disease.","Increased oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in which dopaminergic neurons are intrinsically susceptible to oxidative damage. Swiss albino mice were pretreated with Pycnogenol (PYC), an extract of Pinus maritime bark [20 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] once daily for 15 days. Thereafter, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (20 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) was given four times at 2-hour intervals on 1 day only. Behaviours were altered in the MPTP group as compared with the vehicle-treated group and were restored in the PYC-pretreated MPTP group. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of glutathione were significantly depleted in the MPTP-induced Parkinsonian group. The MPTP group pretreated with PYC showed significant protection of the activity of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione content when compared with the vehicle-treated MPTP group. A significantly elevated level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the MPTP group was decreased significantly in the animals pretreated with PYC. An increase in the number of dopaminergic D2 receptors and decrease in the level of dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid in the striatum were observed after MPTP injection, and restored significantly after PYC pretreatment. Thus, PYC may be used to prevent or reduce the deterioration caused by free radicals, thereby preventing subsequent behavioural and biochemical changes that occur in Parkinsonian mice."
1993,8219199,Soluble CD16 binds peripheral blood mononuclear cells and inhibits pokeweed-mitogen-induced responses.,"Human neutrophils express two types of low affinity receptors for IgG, Fc gamma RII or CD32 and Fc gamma RIIIB or CD16. Human serum contains soluble CD16 (sCD16), which is produced by proteolysis of neutrophil Fc gamma RIIIB, the cleavage site being located close to the cell surface. In order to assess the functional roles of sCD16, we have produced, in eukaryotic cells, a recombinant sCD16 containing the extracellular region of Fc gamma RIIIB. Purified sCD16, of molecular mass of 48 kD, bound human IgG1 and IgG3 but not IgG2, IgG4, or F(ab')2. It inhibited, in a time and dose-dependent fashion, proliferation and IgM and IgG production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in vitro. FACS analysis showed that biotinylated sCD16 bound specifically to a fraction (35%) of PBMC, which corresponds to monocytes and to subsets of B and T lymphocytes. Moreover, sCD16 did not modify the staining of PBMC by FITC-coupled PWM. Thus, the biologic function(s) of sCD16 on PWM-induced responses are exerted through direct and specific interaction(s) with mononuclear blood cells and not with PWM. In conclusion, neutrophils may play a regulatory role on immune responses via the production of soluble forms of CD16 with cell-binding and antiproliferative capacities."
2019,30698102,Expeditious prediction of post-mortem changes in frozen fish meat using three-dimensional fluorescence fingerprints.,"The present study was conducted to characterize fluorophores in the fish body using three-dimensional fluorescence fingerprints (3D-FFs) and to utilize these 3D-FFs obtained from frozen horse mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) fillets to predict early post-mortem changes. Alive fish were sacrificed instantly, preserved in ice until 2 days, and then filleted, vacuum packed, and frozen. Subsequently, 3D-FFs of the frozen fillets were acquired using F-7000 aided with a fiber probe. Post-mortem freshness changes were tracked by measuring adenylate energy charge (AEC) values and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD and NADH) content. Partial least squares regression models for predicting AEC values and NADH content in frozen fish meat showed good fittings, with R2 of 0.90 and 0.85, by utilizing eight and five excitation wavelengths, respectively, based on their fluorescence features acquired from standard fluorophores. This novel approach of 3D-FFs could be utilized as an efficient technique for at-line monitoring of frozen fish quality."
2007,17910615,Effects of marjoram volatile oil and grape seed extract on ethanol toxicity in male rats.,"Natural dietary antioxidants are extensively studied for their ability to protect cells from miscellaneous damages. Marjoram volatile oil (Origanum majorana L., Lamiaceae) and grape seed extract (Vitis vinifera L., Vitaceae) are potent antioxidants. Effects of administration of marjoram volatile oil or grape seed extract on oral administration of ethanol, simultaneously, daily for 10 weeks were studied through determining epididymal spermatozoal analysis, serum testosterone level, weight and histopathological examination of testis, liver and brain. Glutathione level and lipid peroxidation content as malondialdehyde in the testis, liver and brain were measured. The repeated intake of a great amount of ethanol (10 ml/kg body weight, 25% v/v) was followed by fertility disturbances with low sperm count, impaired sperm motility and decrease in serum testosterone level. Moreover, ethanol toxicity induced significant alterations in the histological structures of the testis, liver and brain. The results revealed a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in the level of glutathione in the testis, liver and brain in the ethanol-treated group. However, co-administration of the extracts of protective plants resulted in minimizing the hazard effects of ethanol toxicity on male fertility, liver and brain tissues. It may be concluded that marjoram volatile oil and grape seed extract are useful herbal remedies, especially for controlling oxidative damages."
2011,22029226,Influence of piperine on ibuprofen induced antinociception and its pharmacokinetics.,"Piperine (CAS 94-62-2), an alkaloid obtained from Piper nigrum and P. longum, is a known inhibitor of various enzymes (CYP isozymes) responsible for biotransformation of drugs. By inhibiting the metabolism of drugs, piperine improves the bioavailability of drugs. In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of ibuprofen evaluated by both acetic acid writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with ibuprofen. Ibuprofen plasma concentration was also increased when it was administered with piperine. The synergistic antinociception activity of ibuprofen when administered with piperine can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of ibuprofen. From this study it can be concluded that piperine can be used as a bioenhancer along with ibuprofen."
2017,28268256,Cannabidiol regulation of emotion and emotional memory processing: relevance for treating anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders.,"Learning to associate cues or contexts with potential threats or rewards is adaptive and enhances survival. Both aversive and appetitive memories are therefore powerful drivers of behaviour, but the inappropriate expression of conditioned responding to fear- and drug-related stimuli can develop into anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders respectively. These disorders are associated with abnormally persistent emotional memories and inadequate treatment, often leading to symptom relapse. Studies show that cannabidiol, the main non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis sativa, reduces anxiety via 5-HT1A and (indirect) cannabinoid receptor activation in paradigms assessing innate responses to threat. There is also accumulating evidence from animal studies investigating the effects of cannabidiol on fear memory processing indicating that it reduces learned fear in paradigms that are translationally relevant to phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol does so by reducing fear expression acutely and by disrupting fear memory reconsolidation and enhancing fear extinction, both of which can result in a lasting reduction of learned fear. Recent studies have also begun to elucidate the effects of cannabidiol on drug memory expression using paradigms with translational relevance to addiction. The findings suggest that cannabidiol reduces the expression of drug memories acutely and by disrupting their reconsolidation. Here, we review the literature demonstrating the anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol before focusing on studies investigating its effects on various fear and drug memory processes. Understanding how cannabidiol regulates emotion and emotional memory processing may eventually lead to its use as a treatment for anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders.

2011,21881230,The influence of glycyrrhiza and antibiotics on the purgative action of sennoside a from Daiokanzoto in mice.,"Daiokanzoto (DKT), a Kampo medicine that includes the combination of two crude drugs (rhubarb and glycyrrhiza), is clinically effective for constipation. The aim of this study is to clarify the influence of glycyrrhiza, three glycyrrhiza constituents (glycyrrhizin, liquiritin, and liquiritin apioside), and eight antibiotics on the purgative action of DKT, rhubarb, or sennoside A, a constituent of rhubarb, in mice. The purgative actions of rhubarb and sennoside A were significantly intensified when glycyrrhiza was co-administered orally to mice. Liquiritin and liquiritin apioside but not glycyrrhizin showed significant amplification of the purgative action in a dose-dependent manner. The purgative actions of DKT and sennoside A were significantly reduced by the pre-administration of ampicillin, cefcapene pivoxil, faropenem, fosfomycin, or kanamycin, but were not affected by the pre-administration of clarithromycin or levofloxacin. On the other hand, the purgative action of sennoside A was significantly reduced by the pre-administration of minocycline, whereas that of DKT was not affected. The effect of minocycline on the purgative action of sennoside A was lost when glycyrrhiza was co-administered. These results suggest that liquiritin and liquiritin apioside contribute as active substances for the purgative action of DKT, and some antibiotics reduce the purgative action of DKT and sennoside A. Furthermore, glycyrrhiza has the ability to recover the purgative action of sennoside A suppressed by minocycline via an unknown mechanism."
2015,25422092,Low dose zinc supplementation beneficially affects seizure development in experimental seizure models in rats.,"The role of zinc in seizure models and with antiepileptic drugs sodium valproate (SV) and phenytoin (PHT) was studied using experimental models of seizures in rats. Male Wistar rats, 150-250 g were administered zinc 2, 20, and 200 mg/kg, orally for 14 days. Sixty minutes after the last dose of zinc, rats were challenged with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 60 mg/kg, ip) or maximal electroshock (MES, 70 mA, 0.2 s duration). In another group, SV (150/300 mg/kg, ip) or PHT (40 mg/kg, ip) was administered after 30 min of zinc administration followed by seizure challenge. Zinc pretreatment at all doses had no effect on MES seizures. In PTZ seizures, with the lowest dose used, i.e., 2 mg/kg, a protective effect was observed. Neither the protection offered by the 100 % anticonvulsant dose of SV (300 mg/kg) in PTZ seizures was affected by pre-treatment with zinc nor a combination of subanticonvulsant dose of SV (150 mg/kg) and zinc offer any statistically significant advantage over either drug alone. The combination of phenytoin with zinc had no effect on any of the parameters tested. Apart from this, chronic zinc administration hampered development of chemically (PTZ)-kindled seizures in rats. Zinc supplementation is unlikely to have any undesirable effect when used in epileptics rather it may offer advantage in epileptic and seizure prone patients. "
2016,27044811,Protective effects of propolis on methotrexate-induced testis injury in rat.,"Propolis is an adhesive substance which is collected and used by honeybees. Propolis is a potent antioxidant and a free radical scavenger. This study was designed to determine whether propolis could protect against dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by methotrexate-induced injury in rat testis. A total of 40 male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups: group 1 was the untreated control. On the eighth day of the experiment, groups 2 and 3 received single intraperitoneal injections of methotrexate (MTX) at 20mg/kg. Groups 3 and 4 received 100mg/kg/day propolis (by oral gavage) for 15 days by the first day of the experimental protocol. Then the rats were decapitated under anesthesia, and their testes were removed. The histopathological and biochemical analysis along with apoptosis assessment of testis tissues were compared. Immunohistochemical analysis of Heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) were performed. The phenolic characterization of propolis was performed by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methotrexate caused tended to increase in malondialdehyde level and in the number of apoptotic cells; it also caused a decrease in MSTD and JTBS, PCNA and HSP-70 expression and xanthine oxidase levels in group 2. Propolis prevented the rise in malondialdehyde, xanthine oxidase levels and HSP-70 expression and improved testicular morphology and JTBS. It was found that, methorexate gives rise to serious damage in the testes and propolis is a potent antioxidant agent in preventing testicular injury. "
2005,16272734,Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory phenylbutenoids from the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar.,"Phenylbutenoids isolated previously from the CHCl3 extracts of the rhizomes of Zingiber cassumunar, were evaluated for their cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitory activity along with a new isolate, from the n-BuOH extracts of this plant. The COX-2 inhibitory assay was performed by measuring prostaglandin E2 production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Two phenylbutenoid dimers, and, exhibited considerable activity with IC50 values of 2.71 and 3.64 microM. Two phenylbutenoid monomers, and, showed moderate activity (IC50 14.97, 20.68 microM, respectively). The other three phenylbutenoids, were found to be inactive. Compound was elucidated as a new phenylbutenoid glycoside, namely, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside by spectral analysis including various 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments."
2012,23063742,"Evaluation of benznidazole treatment combined with nifurtimox, posaconazole or AmBisome® in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi strains.","The present work aimed to investigate the curative effect of benznidazole (BZL) in combination with other patented drugs [nifurtimox (NFX), posaconazole (POS) or AmBisome(®) (AMB)] in mice acutely or chronically infected with either a BZL-susceptible (Tulahuen) or a BZL-partially-resistant (Y) strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. To appreciate the eventual advantage of such combinations, infected mice were treated for short durations (non-curative) of each individual treatment. Cure rates were determined by investigating blood parasites (microscopic examination) and parasite DNA (quantitative PCR) after submitting treated mice to immune suppression with cyclophosphamide. The results mainly suggest that shorter durations of treatment combining BZL and POS or NFX might cure mice acutely or chronically infected with the Tulahuen strain, whereas the combination of BZL with AMB does not have such an effect. Moreover, the association BZL+POS does not improve the curative effect of POS (all used for shorter durations) in infection with the Y strain. Shortening the duration of treatment whilst keeping a complete curative effect deserves interest in limiting adverse reactions due to dose-cumulative toxic effects of long treatment. Genotyping of the T. cruzi strain(s) infecting patients might also allow a better adaptation of individual therapeutic schedules, improving both the efficiency and safety of trypanocidal treatment. This preliminary experimental study should encourage further investigations to find the best combination of adequate drug concentrations and timing of treatment."
1998,9834039,"Grapefruit juice-simvastatin interaction: effect on serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.","Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering agent that is metabolized through CYP3A4. We studied the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered simvastatin.In a randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took either 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice or water 3 times a day for 2 days. On day 3, each subject ingested 60 mg simvastatin with either 200 mL grapefruit juice or water, and an additional 200 mL was ingested 1/2 and 1 1/2 hours after simvastatin administration. Serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and those of active (naive) and total (after hydrolysis) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by a radioenzyme inhibition assay.Grapefruit juice increased the mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin about 9-fold (range, 5.1-fold to 31.4-fold; P < .01) and the mean area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 16-fold (range, 9.0-fold to 37.7-fold; P < .05). The mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin acid were both increased about 7-fold (P < .01). Grapefruit juice increased the mean AUC(0-infinity) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 2.4-fold (P < .01) and 3.6-fold (P < .01), respectively. The time of the peak concentration of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased by grapefruit juice (P < .05).Grapefruit juice greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and, to a lesser extent, those of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The probable mechanism of this interaction was inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of simvastatin by grapefruit juice in the small intestine. Concomitant use of grapefruit juice and simvastatin, at least in large amounts, should be avoided, or the dose of simvastatin should be greatly reduced."
2013,24012928,Levosimendan inhibits interleukin-1β-induced cell migration and MMP-9 secretion in rat cardiac fibroblasts.,"Cell migration and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion in cardiac fibroblasts are important processes in the cardiac remodeling during the development of cardiac diseases and are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines. Although levosimendan, a novel inotropic agent, is expected to have some beneficial influences on preventing cardiac remodeling, its effects on proinflammatory cytokines-induced functional changes in cardiac fibroblasts have not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated the effects of levosimendan on interleukin (IL)-1β-induced MMP-9 secretion and migration in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from adult male Wistar rats. MMP-9 secretion in culture medium and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cell lysate were measured by using Western blotting. Gelatin zymography was performed to measure activity of secreted MMP-9. MMP-9 mRNA expression in the cell was measured by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Boyden chamber assay was performed for detection of migration. Levosimendan (3-100 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited IL-1β (4 ng/ml)-induced MMP-9 secretion, activity and mRNA expression. Levosimendan inhibited IL-1β (4 ng/ml)-induced ERK phosphorylation. Levosimendan (10 and 100 μM) inhibited IL-1β-induced migration, and CTTHWGFTLC peptide (10 μM), an MMP inhibitor, or PD98059 (50 μM), an ERK inhibitor, also suppressed it. The present study for the first time demonstrated in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts that levosimendan inhibits IL-1β-induced migration at least partly through the inhibition of MMP-9 secretion via suppressing ERK phosphorylation."
2017,28193438,Direct extraction of tetracyclines from bovine milk using restricted access carbon nanotubes in a column switching liquid chromatography system.,"This paper describes, for the first time, the use of restricted access carbon nanotubes (RACNTs) in the analysis of tetracyclines from milk samples, in a multidimensional liquid chromatographic system. Milk samples were initially acidified and centrifuged, and then the supernatant was directly analyzed in a column switching system in backflush configuration employing an extraction column of RACNTs. The sorbent was able to exclude all the remained proteins in less than 2.0min. The method was linear from 50 to 200μgL-1 and the coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.997, 0.992, 0.994 and 0.998 for oxytetracycline (OXI), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC) and doxycycline (DOX), respectively. The analytical range included the maximum residue limits established by the regulatory agency."
2012,22161289,The influence of selenium on root growth and oxidative stress induced by lead in Vicia faba L. minor plants.,"The effect of selenium (Se) on Vicia faba L. minor roots subjected to lead (Pb) stress was studied by investigating root growth, root viability, and antioxidant enzyme activity. The experiments were carried out on plants grown for 2 weeks on Hoagland medium supplied with 50 μM Pb in the form of lead nitrate Pb(NO(3))(2) and/or Se concentrations of 1.5 and 6 μM in the form of sodium selenite Na(2)SeO(3). It was shown that Pb reduced the root growth and caused serious damage in the roots, which was accompanied by metal accumulation in these tissues. The exposition of roots to Pb led to significant changes in the biochemical parameters: the MDA and T-SH content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity increased but the guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity decreased. Moreover, Pb intensified O(2)(·-) production in the roots. Selenium at a lower concentration alleviated Pb toxicity which was accompanied by a decreased O(2)(·-) production in the apical parts of roots and increased the T-SH content and GPOX activity. However, higher Se concentration intensified MDA and T-SH accumulation and GPOX and GSH-Px activity in Pb-treated plant roots. At low concentration, Se improved cell viability whereas at high concentration it was pro-oxidant and enhanced the lipid peroxidation and cell membrane injury."
2012,22455758,"Usual folic acid intakes: a modelling exercise assessing changes in the amount of folic acid in foods and supplements, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2008.","The USA currently fortifies enriched cereal grain products (ECGP) with folic acid at 140 μg/100 g. In addition, folic acid can be voluntarily added to ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) up to 400 μg/serving and it is found in many dietary supplements, most often at a dose of 400 μg. We sought to model folic acid intake under various fortification and supplementation scenarios.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a population-based cross-sectional survey representative of the non-institutionalized, civilian US population. Information on folic acid intake is collected in two 24 h dietary recalls and survey questions on dietary supplement use, which allows estimation of usual total folic acid intake. We modelled five different levels of folic acid fortification in ECGP, while varying the amounts in RTEC and dietary supplements.United States.US adults (n 14 353) aged ≥19 years; non-pregnant women of childbearing age (n 4272).The percentage of adults with usual daily folic acid intake above the tolerable upper intake level of 1000 μg was influenced more by the typical amount in supplements, while the median intake was influenced more by the ECGP fortification level. By manipulating the amount in at least two sources, it was possible to shift the distribution such that more women of childbearing age consumed the recommended intake of 400 μg of folic acid without increasing the percentage of adults with intake above the tolerable upper intake level. The results varied among population subgroups.Our results suggest that combined strategies are required to meet population recommendations for folic acid intake."
2010,20731193,"Lactoferrin, lysozyme and immunoglobulin G content in milk of four breeds of cows managed under intensive production system.","The aim of the study was to analyze chosen antibacterial protein content, i.e. immunoglobulin G, lactoferrin and lysozyme in bovine milk obtained from cows of four breeds raised and maintained under intensive production technology, that is in the free stall system, and fed total mixed ration diet (TMR system). The studies were conducted on milk from four breeds of dairy cows maintained in Poland, i.e. Polish Holstein-Friesian Black-White and Red-White variety, Jersey and Simental. Milk samples were collected solely from healthy cows, having performed the TOK test with Mastirapid. Further analyses were made only on the milk samples with SCC determined under 2.0 x 10(5) cells/ml, i.e. 423 samples. Each sample was examined for lactoferrin and lysozyme determination using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV-VIS detector. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were established by the aid of radial immunodiffusion technique with Bovine IgG LL tests (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). It should be stated that a breed of cow had a significant effect on a content of the antimicrobial proteins analyzed in bovine milk evaluated. Milk obtained from Simental and Jersey cows prove to be their excellent source, i.e. lactoferrin (116.74 and 103.48 mg/l), lysozyme (9.84 and 13.02 microg/l) and immunoglobulin G (579.9 and 508.6 mg/l). The highest content of these protein was stated in milk of multiparous cows at the late stage of lactation."
2018,29233772,Genetic toxicological assessment and anti-arthritic effects of an ethanolic extract obtained from Salvia lachnostachys Benth leaves in mice.,"In the present study, mice were subjected to prolonged treatment with ethanolic extract of Salvia lachnostachys Benth leaves (SLEE), and the inflammatory and arthritic parameters were evaluated using the Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) model. The genotoxicity of SLEE were also assayed using genetic toxicological tests. For the CFA model, 28 male C57BL/6 mice were distributed randomly into four groups (control, 50 mg/kg of SLEE, 100 mg/kg of SLEE and dexamethasone) for the evaluation of hyperalgesia and paw edema for 21 days after injection of CFA into the paw. To conduct the toxicogenetic assessments (comet assay and micronuclei assay), apoptosis and splenic phagocytosis were evaluated in male Swiss mice after the administration of saline (control group), cyclophosphamide (positive control group) and SLEE (10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg). SLEE significantly reduced the mechanical hyperalgesia and edema caused by CFA injection. The results of the toxicogenetic assessment revealed no toxicogenetic potential in the mice, and the evaluation of apoptosis showed an increase in apoptotic cells in the spleen after 72 h of treatment with SLEE (1000 mg/kg). SLEE exhibited anti-arthritic activity with no toxicogenetic damage. These toxicogenic results support the safety of SLEE."
1979,224735,Bovine trypanosomiasis: effect on the immune response of the infected host.,"Yearling cattle were inoculated with a recently isolated field strain of Trypanosoma congolense. Dinitrophenylated ovalbumin, a bacteriophage, or bovine parainfluenza-3 virus injected into the cattle during the first 5 weeks of infection resulted in peak serum antibody titers lower but not much lower than those produced by noninfected cattle. Primary and secondary antibody responses of inoculated cattle required more time to reach peak titers. Peripheral blood lymphocyte concentrations decreased to 42% of preinfection base-line value 1 1/2 weeks after the onset of T congolense infection and thereafter plateaued at less than 75% of base-line value. Lymphocyte cultures prepared from infected and noninfected cattle gave no marked differences in [(3)H]thymidine uptake after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen. Differences in lymphpocyte responsiveness were not noticed in one-way mixed lymphocyte culture reactions, using mitomycin C-treated lymphocytes from noninfected cattle as stimulator cells."
2008,18026934,Resveratrol attenuates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.,"Cisplatin is an antitumor drug widely used in the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, the most common adverse effect, nephrotoxicity, limits the use of this drug in many cancer patients. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that presents highly efficient protection in experimental nephrotoxicity models. This study evaluated the effect of resveratrol on cisplatin-induced kidney damage. Male Wistar rats were treated with resveratrol (25 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) before the administration of cisplatin (5 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and killed 2 or 5 days later. Blood and urine samples were collected and the kidneys were removed. Rats from the cisplatin group showed acute tubular cell necrosis and increased immunostaining for ED1 (macrophages/monocytes) and T-lymphocytes in the renal cortex and outer medulla when compared with the control group. These alterations were less intense in animals pre-treated with resveratrol. Moreover, indicators of renal injury such as increased serum creatinine levels, urinary volume and urinary protein caused by the administration of cisplatin, were also significantly reduced with resveratrol. Increased lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion in tissue were attenuated by resveratrol. In conclusion, resveratrol attenuated the cisplatin-induced structural and functional renal changes by reducing free radicals and inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltrates."
2019,31010264,Effects of Oenanthe javanica on Nitrogen Removal in Free-Water Surface Constructed Wetlands under Low-Temperature Conditions.,"To investigate the role and microorganism-related mechanisms of macrophytes and assess the feasibility of Oenanthe javanica (Blume) DC. in promoting nitrogen removal in free-water surface constructed wetlands (FWS-CWS) under low temperatures (<10 °C), pilot-scale FWS-CWS, planted with O. javanica, were set up and run for batch wastewater treatment in eastern China during winter. The presence of macrophytes observably improved the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen (65%-71%) and total nitrogen (41%-48%) (p < 0.05), with a sharp increase in chemical oxygen demand concentrations (about 3-4 times). Compared to the unplanted systems, the planted systems not only exhibited higher richness and diversity of microorganisms, but also significantly higher abundances of bacteria, ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA), nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), dissimilatory cd1-containing nitrite reductase gene (nirS), and dissimilatory copper-containing nitrite reductase gene (nirK) in the substrate. Meanwhile, the analysis of the microbial community composition further revealed significant differences. The results indicate that enhanced abundances of microorganisms, and the key functional genes involved with nitrogen metabolism in the planted systems played critical roles in nitrogen removal from wastewater in FWS-CWS. Furthermore, abundant carbon release from the wetland macrophytes could potentially aid nitrogen removal in FWS-CWS during winter."
2007,17916974,131I induced hematological alterations in rat blood: protection by zinc.,"The present study was planned to determine the potential of zinc in attenuating the toxicity induced by 131I in rat blood. Female wistar rats were segregated into four main groups. Animals in Group I served as normal controls; Group II animals were administered a dose of 3.7 Mbq of 131I (carrier free) intraperitoneally, Group III was supplemented with Zinc in the form of ZnSo4.7H2O (227 mg/l drinking water), and Group IV was given a combined treatment of Zinc as well as 131I, in a similar way as was given to Groups IV and II animals, respectively. The effects of different treatments were studied on various parameters in rat blood including hemoglobin (Hb) levels, % hematocrit, zinc protoporphyrins (ZPP), activities of enzymes which included aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) and Na+ K+ ATPase and uptake of 65Zn in blood. The study revealed an increase in the levels of hemoglobin, % hematocrit, activities of delta-ALAD, Na+ K+ ATPase and uptake of 65Zn, 7 days after the 131I treatment. On the contrary, the levels of ZPP were found to be significantly decreased after 131I treatment. However, zinc treatment to 131I-treated animals significantly attenuated the various biochemical and hematological indices. Moreover, zinc treatment to the 131I-treated animals could significantly decrease the uptake of 65Zn, which was increased after 131I treatment. Based upon these data, the present study suggests that zinc has the potential to attenuate 131I induced toxicity by restoring the altered hematological indices and biochemical changes."
2012,22011640,Effects of blackcurrant-based juice on atherosclerosis-related biomarkers in cultured macrophages and in human subjects after consumption of a high-energy meal.,"Regular consumption of fruit and vegetables may be associated with decreased CVD risk. In the present study, we investigated the effects of blackcurrant (BC) juice, rich in polyphenols and ascorbic acid, on oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers in cultured macrophages in vitro and in human subjects with an atherosclerosis-prone phenotype (after consumption of a high-energy meal). In cultured macrophages (RAW264.7), BC treatment significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation as indicated by lower mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and lower nuclear p65 levels indicating decreased NF-κB activity. iNOS protein levels were lower and haem oxygenase 1 levels higher in BC-treated cells when compared with untreated controls. Subjects given a high-energy meal had elevated serum glucose and insulin levels with no significant difference between the BC-based juice and placebo treatment groups. TAG following meal ingestion tended to be attenuated after the BC treatment. Plasma ascorbic acid and radical-scavenging capacity were decreased following placebo meal consumption; however, BC significantly elevated both parameters compared with baseline and placebo ingestion. Plasma oxidised LDL, α-tocopherol and paraoxonase activity were unchanged in both treatment groups. Furthermore, production of TNF-α and IL-1β was not significantly changed by BC meal consumption. The present results suggest potential antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of BC in vitro in cultured macrophages. Although the observations were not directly transferable to a postprandial in vivo situation, the present results show that BC juice consumption may improve postprandial antioxidant status as indicated by higher ascorbic acid levels and free radical-scavenging capacity in plasma."
2012,22289658,Gentamicin and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2)-delivering heparinized-titanium implant with enhanced antibacterial activity and osteointegration.,"Insufficient bonding of implants to bone tissues and bacterial infections lead to the failure of titanium (Ti)-based orthopedic and dental implants. The aim of this study is to develop novel Ti implants that enhance osteoblast functions, while simultaneously decreasing bacterial infections. First, the surface of pristine Ti was functionalized with heparin-dopamine by mimicking a mussel adhesion mechanism. Gentamicin sulfate (GS) and/or bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) was then sequentially immobilized to the heparinized-Ti (Hep-Ti) surface. The compositions of pristine Ti and Hep-Ti with or without gentamicin and/or BMP-2 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on the substrates was assayed. Osteoblast functions of all Ti substrates were investigated by cell proliferation assays, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and calcium deposition. The results showed that the growth of bacteria on GS/Hep-Ti and GS/BMP-2/Hep-Ti was significantly lower compared to that on the pristine Ti and BMP-2/Hep-Ti. In addition, BMP-2/Hep-Ti and GS/BMP-2/Hep-Ti significantly enhanced ALP activity and calcium mineral deposition of osteoblast cells. Taken together, GS/BMP-2/Hep-Ti could achieve the dual functions of excellent antibacterial activity and osteoblast function promotion. Therefore, dual drug (antibiotics and osteoinductive protein)-eluting Ti substrates such as GS/BMP-2/Hep-Ti are a promising material for the enhanced osteointegration and implant longevity in orthopedics and dentistry."
1995,7575073,Beneficial effect of digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragments in oleander intoxication.,"A 24-year-old man presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and an acute confusional state of 6 hours' duration. Ten hours before admission, he had ingested a mixture of orange juice and six ground leaves, later identified as Nerium oleander (common pink oleander) leaves. His blood pressure was 100/80 mm Hg, and his pulse rate was irregular at 40/min. He was disoriented and his speech was dysarthric. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed a complete atrioventricular block, with a nodal escape rhythm of 40/min and diffuse ST depression. The presumptive diagnosis of acute oleander intoxication was confirmed by the detection of digoxin (1.0 nmol/L [0.8 ng/mL]) on radioimmunoassay. Despite intensive therapy, the patient's hemodynamic condition deteriorated. His blood pressure decreased to 70/40 mm Hg; he became oliguric and nonresponsive to external stimuli; and his potassium concentration rose to 6.8 mmol/L. Eighteen hours after admission, an empiric 480-mg dose of digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragments was administered intravenously over 30 minutes. Within minutes of the initiation of immunotherapy, the patient woke up; his blood pressure rose to 90/50 mm Hg; and he regained a sinus rhythm of 68/min with a prolonged PR interval. His potassium concentration decreased to 5.1 mmol/L within 15 minutes and normalized within 1 hour of therapy initiation. One day later, the 1 degree atrioventricular block disappeared, but the ST depression persisted for an additional 6 days. The value of digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragments in the treatment of plant glycoside and, in particular, oleander intoxication is discussed."
2015,25867076,Anti-hypertensive and renoprotective effects of berberine in spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"We aimed to investigate the effects of berberine on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as its effects on blood pressure and renal damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats.Berberine was administrated to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR rats) between 3 and 20 weeks of age. Blood pressure was monitored in 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 16- and 20-week-old SHR rats and age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY rats). Besides, we measured levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone and pre-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, IL-23) in serum and kidney, as well as levels of collagen III and collagen IV in kidney and urinary markers of renal injury (osteopontin, kidney-injury-molecule (KIM-1) and albumin) in 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 16- and 20-week-old SHR rats and WKY rats. Glomerulosclerosis was also assessed with hematoxylin and eosin staining.SHR rats developed hypertension at the age of 6 weeks and had increased levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, collagen III, collagen IV, osteopontin, KIM-1 and albumin, as well as more severe glomerulosclerosis, compared to the aged-matched WKY rats. Berberine delayed the onset and attenuated the severity of hypertension, as well as partially inhibited the increases of the above substances in SHR rats.Berberine could delay the onset and attenuate the severity of hypertension, as well as ameliorate hypertension-induced renal damage in SHR rats. Furthermore, berberine could inhibit the activities of RAS and pre-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23, which are involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension."
2002,12028662,Metabolism of quercetin and kaempferol by rat hepatocytes and the identification of flavonoid glycosides in human plasma.,"1. The metabolism of the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol by rat hepatocytes was investigated using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS). Quercetin and kaempferol were extensively metabolized (98.8 +/- 0.1% and 81.0 +/- 5.1% respectively, n = 4), with four glucuronides of quercetin and two of kaempferol being detected after incubation. 2. The glucuronides of quercetin and kaempferol formed upon incubation with rat hepatocytes were identified as the same ones formed after incubation with the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform UGT1A9. 3. In addition, plasma samples from human volunteers taken after consumption of capsules of Ginkgo biloba, a plant rich in flavonoid glycosides, were analysed by LC-MS for the presence of flavonoid glucuronides and flavonoid glycosides. Reported is evidence for the presence of flavonoid glycosides in samples of plasma. 4. The results suggest that UGT1A9 is a key UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform for the metabolism of flavonoids, and that absorption of intact flavonoid glycosides is possible."
2011,21251335,"The effects of laminarin derived from Laminaria digitata on measurements of gut health: selected bacterial populations, intestinal fermentation, mucin gene expression and cytokine gene expression in the pig.","The aim of the present study was to establish the optimum inclusion level of laminarin derived from Laminaria digitata on selected microbial populations, intestinal fermentation, cytokine and mucin gene expression in the porcine ileum and colon. A total of twenty-one pigs (mean body weight 17·9 kg) were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: T1 - basal (control) diet, T2 and T3 - basal diets supplemented with laminarin included at 300 and 600 parts per million (ppm), respectively. Selected intestinal bacterial populations and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were measured in the ileum and colon. Relative gene expression levels for specific cytokine and mucin genes were investigated in ileal and colonic tissue in the absence and presence of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. There was an up-regulation of MUC2 gene expression at the 300 ppm inclusion level in the ileum. In the colon, there was a significant reduction in the enterobacteriaceae population at the 300 ppm inclusion level (P = 0·0421). Dietary supplementation of 600 ppm laminarin led to a significant increase in MUC2 (P = 0·0365) and MUC4 (P = 0·0401) expression in the colon, and in the total VFA concentration in the caecum (P = 0·0489). A significant increase was also recorded in IL-6 (P = 0·0289) and IL-8 gene expression (P = 0·0245) in LPS-challenged colonic tissue at both laminarin inclusion levels. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of 300 ppm laminarin appears to be the optimum dose in the present study due to the reduction in the enterobacteriaceae populations and enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine expression in response to an ex vivo LPS challenge."
2011,21512251,The in vivo and in vitro stimulatory effects of cordycepin on mouse leydig cell steroidogenesis.,"Cordycepin, a pure compound of Cordyceps sinensis (CS), is known as an adenosine analog. We have found that CS stimulated Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Here we investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of cordycepin in primary mouse Leydig cell steroidogenesis. The results indicate that cordycepin increased the plasma testosterone concentration. Cordycepin also stimulated in vitro mouse Leydig cell testosterone production in dose- and time-dependent manners. We further observed that cordycepin regulated the mRNA expression of the A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 adenosine receptors in the mouse Leydig cells, and that antagonists of A1, A2a, and A3 suppressed testosterone production 20-50% testosterone production. Furthermore, Rp-cAMPS (cAMP antagonist) and Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibitors (H89 and PKI) significantly decreased cordycepin-induced testosterone production, indicating that the PKA-cAMP signal pathway was activated by cordycepin through adenosine receptors. Moreover, cordycepin induced StAR protein expression, and H89 suppressed cordycepin-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression. Conclusively, cordycepin associated with adenosine receptors to activate cAMP-PKA-StAR pathway and steroidogenesis in the mouse Leydig cells."
2008,18042308,Addition of oat hulls to an extruded rice-based diet for weaner pigs ameliorates the incidence of diarrhoea and reduces indices of protein fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract.,"An experiment was conducted to determine whether adding oat hulls to weaner pig diets based on extruded rice or unprocessed wheat influenced post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and protein fermentation in the large intestine. Ninety-six male piglets (5.16 (SEM 0.08) kg) were allocated to (i) extruded rice plus animal proteins (RAP); (ii) RAP with added oat hulls (20 g/kg); (iii) wheat plus animal proteins (WAP); (iv) WAP with added oat hulls (20 g/kg). Blood and faecal samples were collected on days 7 and 14 after weaning at about age 21 d. Pigs fed RAP had more PWD than pigs fed WAP (P < 0.05). Oat hull supplementation to diet RAP decreased the incidence of PWD (P < 0.05). The total-tract digestibility of DM, starch and energy was higher in rice-based diets than in wheat-based diets (P < 0.001); however, oat hulls decreased digestibility of DM and gross energy (P < 0.001). Pigs fed RAP had higher plasma creatinine concentrations (P < 0.01), which were positively correlated to cumulative beta-haemolytic Escherichia coli scores after weaning (R2 0.928; P = 0.015). Addition of oat hulls decreased plasma urea concentrations only in pigs fed RAP (interaction; P < 0.05). Pigs fed RAP had lower faecal total biogenic amine concentrations than pigs fed WAP (P < 0.001). Oat hull supplementation tended to decrease total biogenic amine concentrations (P = 0.103). These data indirectly suggest that a mostly insoluble dietary fibre source such as oat hulls can decrease PWD in dietary situations where there may be a misbalance of carbohydrate to protein entering the hindgut."
2010,20804630,The effectiveness of dried cranberries ( Vaccinium macrocarpon) in men with lower urinary tract symptoms.,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common condition in older men. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) powder in men at risk of prostate disease with LUTS, elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), negative prostate biopsy and clinically confirmed chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Forty-two participants received either 1500 mg of the dried powdered cranberries per d for 6 months (cranberry group; n 21) or no cranberry treatment (control group; n 21). Physical examination, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life (QoL), five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), basic clinical chemistry parameters, haematology, Se, testosterone, PSA (free and total), C-reactive protein (CRP), antioxidant status, transrectal ultrasound prostate volume, urinary flow rate, ultrasound-estimated post-void residual urine volume at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months, and urine ex vivo anti-adherence activity were determined in all subjects. In contrast to the control group, patients in the cranberry group had statistically significant improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score, QoL, urination parameters including voiding parameters (rate of urine flow, average flow, total volume and post-void residual urine volume), and lower total PSA level on day 180 of the study. There was no influence on blood testosterone or serum CRP levels. There was no statistically significant improvement in the control group. The results of the present trial are the first firm evidence that cranberries may ameliorate LUTS, independent of benign prostatic hyperplasia or C-reactive protein level."
2011,21787696,The effect of Laminaria japonica polysaccharides on the recovery of the male rat reproductive system and mating function damaged by multiple mini-doses of ionizing radiations.,"To evaluate the radiation-protect effects of Laminaria japonica polysaccharides (LJP) on male reproductive system damage and mating dysfunction induced by multiple mini-dose ionizing radiations, male rats were administrated with radiation and/or LJP. Results showed that mating function (such as erection, mount and ejaculation), sperm count and survival rate in LJP group were significantly better than the corresponding model group after the radiation. The testis organ coefficient, GSH (glutathione) content, serum sex hormones (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone and estradiol) levels improved while MDA (malondialdehyde) content decreased. In addition, SOD (superoxide dismutase), GSH-PX (glutathione peroxidase), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) activities were enhanced while testicular tissue damage was reduced, 14 days after the cessation of radiation; all indicators in the LJP group were similar to the control group. Our results suggest that, LJP has some promoting effects on the recovery of the reproductive system and mating dysfunction induced by radiation."
2010,19762199,"Anticancer activity of fungal taxol derived from Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., an endophytic fungus, against 7, 12 dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats.","Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer worldwide and their incidence increases gradually. Taxol (paclitaxel), a potent anticancer drug, is naturally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew. Taxol is widely used in the treatment of ovarian, lung and breast cancer. The increased demand for taxol, coupled with its limited availability from the protected Pacific yew, has had researchers scrambling for alternate sources. The purpose of the present study is to investigate chemopreventive effect of fungal taxol derived from a novel endophytic fungus Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., isolated from a medicinal plant Morinda citrifolia Linn. The fungal taxol is found to be active against the 7, 12 dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in Sprague dawley rats. The enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutatione peroxidase (GPx), glutatione-S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and vitamin E were evaluated in control and experimental groups. Lipid peroxides levels (LPO) were also tested. Histological analysis of breast tissue was analyzed by haematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the cytoprotective role of fungal taxol active against breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analyses were also performed to evaluate the effect of fungal taxol on the inflammatory marker such as Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in control and experimental groups. The results showed that the fungal taxol significantly suppresses the DMBA-induced breast cancer in Sprague dawley rats."
2011,21092375,Modulation of rat hepatic and kidney phase II enzymes by cabbage juices: comparison with the effects of indole-3-carbinol and phenethyl isothiocyanate.,"The effect of raw cabbage and sauerkraut juices on the expression and activity of phase II enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), in the rat liver and kidney was compared with that of two commercially available products of glucosinolate degradation: indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). Male Wistar rats were treated by oral administration with cabbage juices, I3C or PEITC for 4, 10 and 30 d. The results showed that juices, particularly sauerkraut juice as with I3C and PEITC, significantly increased GST and NQO1 activities in the rat liver. The only exception was the 30 d time point of feeding with raw cabbage juice. Cabbage juices, I3C and PEITC affected the hepatic GST μ to the greatest extent and GST α to a lesser extent. The results of the present study also showed that the treatment of rats with juices and compounds tested caused the translocation of the NF-E2-related transcription factor (Nrf2) active subunit from the cytosol to the nucleus, providing an argument for the involvement of this transcription factor in the induction of GST and NQO1. In contrast to the liver, cabbage juices affected only the renal GST θ, while treatment with I3C and PEITC significantly increased the activity of NQO1. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that induction of the key detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices, particularly sauerkraut, may be responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by epidemiological studies and in animal models. However, the final effects might be organ or tissue dependent."
2006,16508142,Synergistic effect of [10]-gingerol and aminoglycosides against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).,"An extract from ginger (root of Zingiber officinale) reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The effective compound was isolated and identified as [10]-gingerol. In the presence of [10]-gingerol at 1/10 concentration of its own MIC, the MIC of arbekacin was lowered by 1/32 to 1/16. [10]-Gingerol also reduced the MICs of other aminoglycosides, and of bacitracin and polymixin B, but not of other antimicrobial agents tested. Because [10]-gingerol reduced the MICs of several aminoglycosides both in strains possessing or lacking aminoglycoside-modification enzymes, it seems that the effect of [10]-gingerol is not related to these enzymes, which mainly confer bacterial resistance against aminoglycosides. It seemed that a detergent-like effect of [10]-gingerol potentiated the antimicrobial activity of the aminoglycosides. In fact, some detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 reduced the MICs of aminoglycosides, bacitracin and polymixin B in VRE. Since the intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides in enterococci is due to low level of entry of the drugs into the cells, increase in the membrane permeability caused by [10]-gingerol will enhance the influx of aminoglycosides into enterococcal cells."
2014,24001154,The effect of Ginkgo biloba extracts on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cilostazol and its active metabolites in healthy Korean subjects.,"The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) on the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its metabolites. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of GBE on the pharmacodynamics of cilostazol.A randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study was conducted with 34 healthy Korean subjects. All subjects were given an oral dose of cilostazol (100 mg) plus GBE (80 mg) or cilostazol (100 mg) plus placebo twice daily for 7 days. Plasma concentrations of cilostazol and its active metabolites (3,4-dehydrocilostazol and 4'-trans-hydroxycilostazol) were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy on day 7 for pharmacokinetic assessment. The adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and bleeding time were measured at baseline and on day 7 for pharmacodynamic assessment.The geometric mean ratios of area under the concentration-time curve for dosing interval for cilostazol plus GBE vs. cilostazol plus placebo were 0.96 (90% confidence interval, 0.89-1.03; P = 0.20) for cilostazol, 0.96 (90% confidence interval, 0.90-1.02; P = 0.30) for 3,4-dehydrocilostazol and 0.98 (90% confidence interval, 0.93-1.03; P = 0.47) for 4'-trans-hydroxycilostazol. The change of aggregation after administration of cilostazol plus GBE seemed to be 1.31 times higher compared with cilostazol plus placebo, without statistical significance (P = 0.20). There were no significant changes in bleeding times and adverse drug reactions between the treatments.Co-administration of GBE showed no statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol in healthy subjects. A large cohort study with long-term follow-up may be needed to evaluate the possible pharmacodynamic interaction between cilostazol and GBE, given that there was a remarkable, but not statistically significant, increase in inhibition of platelet aggregation."
2006,16989032,"Cranberry and urinary tract infections: slightly fewer episodes in young women, but watch out for interactions.","(1) Female urinary tract infections are common and often recurrent. Food supplements based on cranberries are said to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections. (2) Two randomised controlled trials involving a total of about 300 young women showed that daily use of cranberry juice or tablets reduced the relapse rate for acute cystitis: on average, treating 100 women for one year prevented at least 1 urinary tract infection in 15 to 33 women. The daily doses were 7.5 g of concentrate in 50 ml of water, 750 ml of juice, or two tablets of concentrate. (3) In elderly patients, 2 trials of cranberry-based products in hospitals or nursing homes showed a small reduction in the frequency of relapses. (4) Adverse effects appear to be negligible. However, several case reports of interactions with warfarin have been published, including one involving severe bleeding. Patients on vitamin K antagonists must be warned about this risk of interactions so that they avoid consuming cranberry-based products without medical supervision."
2015,26551926,Blueberry anthocyanins ameliorate radiation-induced lung injury through the protein kinase RNA-activated pathway.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of blueberry anthocyanins (BA) on radiation-induced lung injury and investigate the mechanism of action. Seven days after BA(20 and 80 mg/kg/d)administration, 6 weeks old male Sprague-Dawley rats rats were irradiated by LEKTA precise linear accelerator at a single dose of 20 Gy only once. and the rats were continuously treated with BA for 4 weeks. Moreover, human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) were transfected with either control-siRNA or siRNA targeting protein kinase R (PKR). Cells were then irradiated and treated with 75 μg/mL BA for 72 h. The results showed that BA significantly ameliorated radiation-induced lung inflammation, lung collagen deposition, apoptosis and PKR expression and activation. In vitro, BA significantly protected cells from radiation-induced cell death through modulating expression of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. Suppression of PKR by siRNA resulted in ablation of BA protection on radiation-induced cell death and modulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins, as well as Caspase-3 expression. These findings suggest that BA is effective in ameliorating radiation-induced lung injury, likely through the PKR signaling pathway."
2001,11843845,Interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor alpha are overexpressed in bone marrow T lymphocytes from paediatric patients with aplastic anaemia.,"Twelve paediatric patients with aplastic anaemia and two groups of normal control subjects underwent flow cytometric analysis for intracytoplasmic expression of gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in bone marrow and peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The same cytokines were tested, by immunoassay, in culture supernatants from unstimulated bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs). Marrow CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in the patients in comparison with normal control subjects (P from < 0.05 to < 0.0001 in the different cellular subsets). Patients' marrow CD4+ and CD8+ cells containing gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha were significantly increased when compared with the same cell fractions from paired peripheral blood samples (P from < 0.05 to < 0.0001 in the various cellular subsets). In the supernatant of marrow MNCs, gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha were detected in four out of eight and five out of eight cases, respectively, whereas neither cytokine was traceable in the control subjects. Patients' peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ cells containing gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha were not significantly increased in comparison with those from normal control subjects. Whereas patients with favourable and unfavourable outcomes had no significantly different proportions of marrow gamma-IFN+/CD4+ and gamma-IFN+/CD8+ cells, the percentages of marrow CD4+ and CD8+ cells containing TNF-alpha were significantly lower in subjects with favourable than in those with unfavourable outcome. Overall, these findings show that, in aplastic patients, T cells overexpressing gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha concentrate in the bone marrow and that intracytoplasmic expression of TNF-alpha in marrow CD4+ and CD8+ cells is associated with an unfavourable clinical course."
2011,25212170,Ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric determination of phenolic compounds in cranberry products.,"An ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method has been developed for determination of phenolics in cranberry products. Prior to GC-MS separation and characterisation, the phenolics in samples were hydrolysed by hydrochloric acid with ultrasound-assistance, extracted with ethyl acetate, and derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA)+1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) reagents. The application of ultrasonication significantly accelerated the acidic hydrolysation of the conjugated phenolics. A baseline separation of the 20 phenolics and internal standard was achieved in 25min. Standard calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.0-50μg/mL and detection limits were 0.06-0.70μg/mL. Twenty phenolics were identified in cranberry samples and all of them occurred mainly in conjugated forms. Of those, the benzoic acid, quercetin, and myricetin were most abundant phenolics. The total phenolics were 12.4mg/g in cranberry fruits, 9.1mg/mL in 100% cranberry juice, and 11.1mg/g in cranberry sauces, respectively. "
2017,27979196,"B-vitamins, carotenoids and α-/γ-tocopherol in raw and roasted nuts.","The concentrations of B-vitamins, carotenoids and tocopherols in nuts may differ between species and might be influenced by roasting. Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, lutein, zeaxanthin, β-carotene and α-/γ-tocopherol were determined in different varieties of raw and roasted nuts using HPLC (fluorescence/UV-vis detection). The analysis revealed remarkable concentrations of thiamine and pyridoxine in pistachios (57%, 79% of the recommended daily intake/100g (RDI), respectively) and riboflavin in almonds (119% of the RDI). Pistachios were rich in lutein/zeaxanthin and contained highest β-carotene levels among nuts. Almonds and hazelnuts were abundant in α-tocopherol (>4-fold the RDI for tocopherol equivalents) while pistachios and walnuts were rich in γ-tocopherol. Roasting had a diminishing effect on thiamine, carotenoids and tocopherols especially in almonds and walnuts. Nuts could make a valuable contribution to a healthy diet in regard to B-vitamins, lutein/zeaxanthin and tocopherols. A reduction in micronutrient content by roasting is reliant on the nut variety and specific micronutrient."
2017,28575809,Lutein mitigates cyclophosphamide induced lung and liver injury via NF-κB/MAPK dependent mechanism.,"This study targeted to test the potential protective role of lutein against lung and liver damage associated with cyclophosphamide (CP) administration. Lutein was given orally for 5days at two different doses both before and after CP injection. Results have shown that CP administration caused marked pulmonary and hepatic injurious effects in mice. Lung damage was evident through increased lung wet/dry ratio, elevated inflammatory cells infiltration into the pulmonary tissues, increased total protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Estimation of high levels of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and LDH in serum revealed hepatic injury. Histopathological examination of both organs confirmed the biochemical analysis. Elevation of oxidative stress along with depressed anti-oxidant status of lung and liver were evident in CP-intoxicated animals. Furthermore, CP induced elevation of inflammatory cytokines (NOx, TNF-α, IL-6) contaminant with activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK). On the other side, lutein treatment successfully protected the lung and the liver as indicated by improvement of the biochemical and histopathological parameters. These results suggest that lutein can ameliorate CP-induced pulmonary and hepatic oxidative injurious effects via inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NF-κB/MAPK pathway."
2010,20021702,Physiological concentrations of dietary polyphenols regulate vascular endothelial cell expression of genes important in cardiovascular health.,"Previous cell culture-based studies have shown potential health beneficial effects on gene expression of dietary polyphenols, including those found in red wine and green tea. However, these studies have tended to use higher concentrations (2-100 microm) than those observed in blood (0.1-1 microm) after consuming polyphenol-rich foods or beverages. The present study investigated effects of physiological concentrations of different classes of dietary polyphenol on the expression of genes important in cardiovascular health (endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) by cultured vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) in the absence or presence of H2O2. Resveratrol and quercetin (0.1-1 microm) increased eNOS and VEGF mRNA expression particularly in the absence of H2O2 (50 microm) and decreased H2O2-induced ET-1 mRNA expression (P < 0.001 for polyphenol x H2O2 interactions). Similarly, resveratrol and quercetin decreased endothelin secretion into the media, blocking the stimulatory effect of 50 microm-H2O2 (P < 0.001 for polyphenol x H2O2 interaction). Of the nine other polyphenols tested, only epigallocatechin gallate had similar effects on both the eNOS and ET-1 mRNA expression, but to a lesser extent than resveratrol at an equimolar concentration (0.1 microm). The observed effects on gene expression would be expected to result in vasodilation and thereby reduced blood pressure. Since only three of the eleven polyphenols tested had biological activity, it is unclear whether particular structures are important or whether the effects might relate to the relatively high antioxidant capacities of the three active polyphenols."
1998,9517948,Inter- and intraquinolone predictors of antimicrobial effect in an in vitro dynamic model: new insight into a widely used concept.,"Earlier efforts to search for pharmacokinetic and bacteriological predictors of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial effects (AMEs) have resulted in conflicting findings. To elucidate whether these conflicts are real or apparent, several predictors of the AMEs of two pharmacokinetically different antibiotics, trovafloxacin (TRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), as well as different dosing regimens of CIP were examined. The AMEs of TRO given once daily (q.d.) and CIP given q.d. and twice daily (b.i.d.) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in an in vitro dynamic model. Different monoexponential pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated with a TRO half-life of 9.2 h and a CIP half-life of 4.0 h to provide similar eightfold ranges of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-to-MIC ratios, from 54 to 432 and from 59 to 473 (microg x h/ml)/(microg/ml), respectively. In each case the observation periods were designed to incorporate full-term regrowth phases in the time-kill curves, and the AME was expressed by its intensity (IE; the area between the control growth and time-kill and regrowth curves up to the point at which the viable counts of regrowing bacteria are close to the maximum values observed without drug). Species-independent linear relationships were established between IE and log AUC/MIC, log AUC above MIC (log AUCeff), and time above the MIC (Teff). Specific and nonsuperimposed IE versus log AUC/MIC or log AUCeff relationships were inherent in each of the treatments: TRO given q.d. (r2 = 0.97 and 0.96), CIP given q.d. (r2 = 0.98 and 0.96), and CIP given b.i.d. (r2 = 0.95 and 0.93). This suggests that in order to combine data sets obtained with individual quinolones to examine potential predictors, one must be sure that these sets may be combined. Unlike AUC/MIC and AUCeff, the IE-Teff relationships plotted for the different quinolones and dosing regimens were nonspecific and virtually superimposed (r2 = 0.95). Hence, AUC/MIC, AUCeff and Teff were equally good predictors of the AME of each of the quinolones and each dosing regimen taken separately, whereas Teff was also a good predictor of the AMEs of the quinolones and their regimens taken together. However, neither the quinolones nor the dosing regimens could be distinguished solely on the basis of Teff whereas they could be distinguished on the basis of AUC/MIC or AUCeff. Thus, two types of predictors of the quinolone AME may be identified: intraquinolone and/or intraregimen predictors (AUC/MIC, AUCeff and Teff) and an interquinolone and interregimen predictor (Teff). Teff may be able to accurately predict the AME of one quinolone on the basis of the data obtained for another quinolone."
1978,666093,Serum values of amylase and pancreatic lipase in healthy mature dogs and dogs with experimental pancreatitis.,"Serum values of amylase and pancreatic lipase were determined by the iodometric and the turbidimetric methods, respectively, in 44 mature healthy dogs and in 8 dogs with experimentally induced pancreatitis (plus 1 sham-operated control). Serum value of amylase in mature healthy dogs varied from 250 to 1,500 Caraway units/dl and that of pancreatic lipase varied from 0 to 50 IU/L. Maximal serum values of amylase and pancreatic lipase in the dogs with experimentally induced pancreatitis varied from 4,540 to 14,000 Caraway units/dl and 325 to 810 IU/L, respectively. Following pancreatic damage, serum values of amylase and pancreatic lipase increased rapidly in the 8 dogs and ran parallel to each other in 6 of the 8 dogs studied. However, the serum value of amylase returned to within normal range earlier than the serum value of pancreatic lipase in 2 dogs; the reverse was true in 2 other dogs."
2002,12053593,[The effect of anthocyanins from Aronii melanocarpa and acetylcysteine on selected after-effects of lead acetate poisoning].,"In recent years we have widely examined the results of protracted exposures on lead. Lead mostly shows that it accumulates in bones in an insoluble phosphate form. In much of the experimental research we observed that lead can cause reactive forms of oxygen and oxidative stress. The examination was carried out on 40 female and male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g. They lived in the animal quarters with a stable temperature and humidity. They were fed with standard fodder (Murigan) and water ad libitum. In the work carried out the effect of anthocyanins of Aronia Melanocarpa Elliot and acetylcysteine on the selected parameters of oxidative stress of experimental animals with chronic lead acetate poisoning were examined. After administration anthocyanins substantially decreased the concentration of unsaturated fatty acid peroxidation and carbonyls in blood serum. At the same time we observed a significant decrease of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in urine. Antocyanins from Aronia Melanocarpa appear to be a good substance for the diminishing of oxidative stress, these results caused with long-term administration of lead acetate."
2009,19382723,Antidiabetic and antioxidant activity of Terminalia belerica. Roxb.,"Effect of continuous administration of dried 75% methanolic extract of fruits of Terminalia belerica (Combretaceae) suspended in water was studied in alloxan induced hyperglycemia and antioxidant defense mechanism in rats. T. belerica prevented alloxan-induced hyperglycaemia significantly from 6th day of administration and there was 54% reduction on 12th day. Oxidative stress produced by alloxan was found to be significantly lowered by the administration of T. belerica extract. This was evident from a significant decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides in blood and liver respectively. Similarly, decreased glutathione level produced by alloxan was increased by the administration of the extract in blood and liver. However the increase was not significant. Superoxide dismutase which was decreased by alloxan was significantly increased from 9th day in blood and liver of drug treated group. Similarly there was significant increase in the activity of catalase in blood and liver. Decrease in glutathione peroxidase by alloxan administration was found to be increased significantly in the blood and liver from 9th day by extract treatment. Glutathione reductase also was found to be increased in blood and liver. These results suggested that T. belerica fruit extract possessed anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant activity and these activities may be interrelated."
2003,14723347,Enhancement of heparin and heparin disaccharide absorption by the Phytolacca americana saponins.,"We studied the effects of phytolaccosides, saponins from Phytolacca americana, on the intestinal absorption of heparin in vitro and in vivo. The absorption enhancing activity of these compounds (phytolaccosides B, D2, E, F, G and I) was determined by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the transport amount of heparin disaccharide, the major repeating unit of heparin, across Caco-2 cell monolayers. With the exception of phytolaccoside G, all of them decreased TEER values and increased the permeability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. In vitro, phytolaccosides B, D2, and E showed significant absorption enhancing activities, while effects by phytolaccoside F and I were mild. In vivo, phytolaccoside E increased the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time, indicating that phytolaccoside E modulated the transport of heparin in intestinal route. Our results suggest that a series of phytolaccosides from Phytolacca americana can be applied as pharmaceutical excipients to improve the permeability of macromolecules and hydrophilic drugs having difficulty in absorption across the intestinal epithelium."

2019,30431010,Suppression of isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats by raspberry ketone via activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α.,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) controls the lipid and glucose metabolism and also affects inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis during cardiovascular disease. Raspberry ketone (RK) is a red raspberry (Rubusidaeus, Family-Rosaceae) plant constituent, which activates PPAR-α. This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80 mg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85 mg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-α, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart weight to body weight ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-κB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-α, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-α expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-α activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-α is needed to confirm this assumption."
2014,25114129,Resveratrol is active against Leishmania amazonensis: in vitro effect of its association with Amphotericin B.,"Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in black grapes and red wine and has many biological activities. In this study, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol alone and in association with amphotericin B (AMB) against Leishmania amazonensis. Our results demonstrate that resveratrol possesses both antipromastigote and antiamastigote effects, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 27 and 42 μM, respectively. The association of resveratrol with AMB showed synergy for L. amazonensis amastigotes, as demonstrated by the mean sums of fractional inhibitory index concentration (mean ΣFIC) of 0.483, although for promastigotes, this association was indifferent. Treatment with resveratrol increased the percentage of promastigotes in the sub-G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, reduced the mitochondrial potential, and showed an elevated choline peak and CH2-to-CH3 ratio in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis; all these features indicate parasite death. Resveratrol also decreased the activity of the enzyme arginase in uninfected and infected macrophages with and without stimulation with interleukin-4 (IL-4), also implicating arginase inhibition in parasite death. The anti-Leishmania effect of resveratrol and its potential synergistic association with AMB indicate that these compounds should be subjected to further studies of drug association therapy in vivo.

2011,21272402,"A whole-grain cereal-rich diet increases plasma betaine, and tends to decrease total and LDL-cholesterol compared with a refined-grain diet in healthy subjects.","Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found that whole-grain (WG) cereal foods reduce the risk of several lifestyle-related diseases, though consistent clinical outcomes and mechanisms are elusive. To compare the effects of a WG-rich diet with a matched refined-grain (RG) diet on plasma biomarkers and bowel health parameters, seventeen healthy subjects (eleven females and six males) completed an exploratory cross-over study with a 2-week intervention diet based on either WG- or RG-based foods, separated by a washout of at least 5 weeks. Both diets were the same except for the use of WG (150 g/d) or RG foods. Subjects undertook a 4 h postprandial challenge on day 8 of each intervention diet. After 2 weeks, the WG diet tended to decrease plasma total and LDL-cholesterol (both P = 0·09), but did not change plasma HDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, C-reactive protein or homocysteine compared with the RG diet. Plasma betaine and alkylresorcinol concentrations were elevated after 1 week of the WG diet (P = 0·01 and P < 0·0001, respectively). Clostridium leptum populations in faeces were increased after the WG diet, along with a trend for decreased faecal water pH (P = 0·096) and increased stool frequency (P < 0·0001) compared with the RG diet. A short controlled intervention trial with a variety of commercially available WG-based products tended to improve biomarkers of CVD compared with a RG diet. Changes in faecal microbiota related to increased fibre fermentation and increased plasma betaine concentrations point to both fibre and phytochemical components of WG being important in mediating any potential health effects."
1985,4037555,"Weekly pulse methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical and immunologic effects in a randomized, double-blind study.","Twelve patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis were treated with weekly pulse methotrexate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After 13 weeks of therapy, patients receiving methotrexate showed greater improvement, judged by degree of joint swelling and tenderness, duration of morning stiffness, and subjective assessments of clinical condition, compared to those receiving placebo (p less than or equal to 0.002). This improvement was associated with a decrease in sedimentation rate and decreases in levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA; no changes were seen in serum rheumatoid factor titer or complement protein levels. Proportions of mononuclear cell subsets that were abnormal before treatment (decreased percentage of total T cells, increased percentage of monocytes) improved toward normal after therapy with methotrexate. However, no changes were seen in elevated pretreatment Leu-3/Leu-2 ratios, in in-vitro proliferative responses of lymphocytes to mitogens, or in immunoglobulin secretory responses to pokeweed mitogen. Weekly pulse methotrexate is effective in the short-term treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Little evidence for cellular immune suppression was associated with this clinical benefit."
2015,26062546,Novel antiviral activity of mung bean sprouts against respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus -1: an in vitro study on virally infected Vero and MRC-5 cell lines.,"New sources for discovering novel antiviral agents are desperately needed. The current antiviral products are both expensive and not very effective.The antiviral activity of methanol extract of mung bean sprouts (MBS), compared to Ribavarin and Acyclovir, on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Herpes Simplex virus -1 (HSV-1) was investigated using cytotoxicity, virus yield reduction, virucidal activity, and prophylactic activity assays on Vero and MRC-5 cell lines. Moreover, the level of antiviral cytokines, IFNβ, TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 was assessed in MBS-treated, virally infected, virally infected MBS-treated, and control groups of MRC-5 cells using ELISA.MBS extract showed reduction factors (RF) 2.2 × 10 and 0.5 × 10(2) for RSV and HSV-1, respectively. The 2 h incubation virucidal and prophylactic selectivity indices (SI) of MBS on RSV were 14.18 and 12.82 versus Ribavarin SI of 23.39 and 21.95, respectively, and on HSV-1, SI were 18.23 and 10.9 versus Acyclovir, 22.56 and 15.04, respectively. All SI values were >10 indicating that MBS has a good direct antiviral and prophylactic activities on both RSV and HSV-1. Moreover, interestingly, MBS extract induced vigorously IFNβ, TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 cytokines in MRC-5 infected-treated group far more than other groups (P < 0.05) and induced TNFα and IL-6 in treated group more than infected group (P < 0.05).MBS extract has potent antiviral and to a lesser extent, prophylactic activities against both RSV and HSV-1, and in case of HSV-1, these activities were comparable to Acyclovir. Part of the underlying mechanism(s) of these activities is attributed to MBS potential to remarkably induce antiviral cytokines in human cells. Hence, we infer that MBS methanol extract could be used as such or as purified active component in protecting and treating RSV and HSV-1 infections. More studies are needed to pinpoint the exact active components responsible for the MBS antiviral activities."
2010,20726982,Tuning in to the ‘right’ calcium channel regulation in experimental models of diabetes.,"Elucidation of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying vascular disease is of fundamental importance to the development of pharmacological agents to target these pathways. Pinho et al. in this issue of the BJP provide highly compelling evidence that the δ isoform of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K δ) was upregulated and accounted for the increase in L-type, voltage-gated, Ca channel current in aortic vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells of a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. There are several key issues of broad fundamental significance to this work. Firstly, what is the ‘right’ answer about calcium channel regulation in diabetes? Conflicting reports of increased and decreased Ca channel current may be due to specificity of the vascular bed and species. Then, the time course of diabetic vasculopathy may influence the expression of contractile versus proliferative phenotypes of VSM. Also the metabolic characterization of diabetes may enlighten or confound any study of diabetic vascular disease. These issues need attention to move forward work in this area."
2011,21702225,Hepatoprotective and antioxidant properties of Suaeda maritima (L.) dumort ethanolic extract on concanavalin-A induced hepatotoxicity in rats.,"Hepatoprotective and antioxidant properties of Suaeda maritima (L.) Dumort on concanavalin-A induced stress in Wistar albino rats have been reported. Rats were administered with ethanolic extract of Suaeda maritimna at the concentration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg of body wt. for 9 days and concanavalin-A was administrated (iv) 12 mg/kg on 9th day. Rats in concanavalin-A administered group showed elevated levels of AST, ALT, ALP and bilurubin. Pretreatment of rats with ethanolic extract (300 mg/kg) significantly reduced these serum parameters compared to concavalin-A administered group. Histopathological examination of liver sections showed that, normal liver architecture was disturbed by hepatotoxin intoxication. The extract treated group and silymarin treated group retained the normal cell architecture, although less visible changes were observed. Preliminary phytochemical analysis showed the presence of triterpenioids and may be responsible for the hepatoprotective activity. The LD50 was calculated as 3 g/kg of the body weight. IC50 values of hydroxyl (52.21+/-1.32 microg/ml) and nitric oxide radicals (09.14+/-0.94 microg/ml) scavenging results showed comparable activity with vitamin-C. Results of this study may be useful for the development of herbal medicine from Suaeda maritima for the treatment of hepatitis."
2018,30257396,Broccoli sprouts produce abdominal antinociception but not spasmolytic effects like its bioactive metabolite sulforaphane.,"Abdominal pain is a common health problem that requires efficacious and safe therapy. Broccoli is a rich source of health-promoting bioactive compounds with potential for pain therapy. However, there is a lack of scientific pharmacological evidence to support this. Our aim was to investigate the antinociceptive and spasmolytic activities of broccoli aqueous extracts from seeds, sprouts, and inflorescence, as well as some metabolites. Experiments were done using enteral and parenteral administration in an in vivo model of pain accompanied with an in vitro assay. Data established that sprouts (100 mg/kg, i.p. and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.) produced significant and major antinociceptive effect at similar or even lower doses in comparison to the seeds (125 mg/kg, i.p. and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.) and broccoli heads (250 mg/kg, i.p. and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.). These results resembled the analgesic response observed with the reference drug metamizole (80 mg/kg, i.p.). Chlorogenic acid (CA, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and SFN (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) were partial responsible antinociceptive metabolites of broccoli. SFN effects involved participation of endogenous opioids, since they were inhibited in the presence of naltrexone (5 mg/kg, s.c.). In the in vitro assay, a significant 80% spasmolytic-like response was reached with SFN alone in comparison to 20% obtained with aqueous extracts of sprouts and seeds. Participation of calcium channels was a mechanism involved in the in vitro response of SFN. In conclusion, broccoli sprouts, SFN and CA are potential nutraceuticals for abdominal pain therapy."
2014,24480135,Are zinc transporter type 8 antibodies a marker of autoimmune thyroiditis in non-obese adults with new-onset diabetes?,"The diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese adults is based on the detection of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), islet cell antibodies (ICA) and antibodies to tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A). Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) has been identified as a new autoantigen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The coincidence of autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) with diabetes is common; therefore, screening of TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (ATPO) is recommended during the diagnosis of diabetes. In this study, we determined whether the occurrence of islet autoantibodies is associated with a positive titre of ATPO in newly diagnosed adult-onset autoimmune diabetic patients.THE STUDY INVOLVED 80 NON-OBESE ADULTS AGED 44 (INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR): 37-51) years with a BMI of 24.0 (IQR: 22.2-26.0) kg/m(2) and new-onset diabetes. The markers of autoimmune diabetes (GADA, ICA, IA-2A and ZnT8A), TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (ATPO) were evaluated.IN THE STUDY POPULATION, 70% (N=56) OF THE SUBJECTS WERE POSITIVE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOUR ASSESSED MARKERS OF AUTOIMMUNE DIABETES (83.9% GADA, 62.5% ICA, 42.8% IA-2A AND 33% ZNT8A) AND 37.5% OF THE SUBJECTS WERE POSITIVE FOR ATPO. THE ZNT8A-POSITIVE SUBJECTS HAD HIGHER ATPO TITRES THAN THE ZNT8A-NEGATIVE SUBJECTS (172.7 (IQR: 0.36-410.4) vs 92.4 (IQR: 0-23.7) IU/ml, P=0.001). Based on the assessed islet autoantibodies, the occurrence of positive ZnT8A and GADA was found to be related to a positive titre of ATPO using logistic regression (OR=5.48, 95% CI: 1.65-18.14, P=0.006 and OR=3.42, 95% CI: 1.09-10.71, P=0.03 respectively).In non-obese adults with new-onset diabetes, the presence of GADA and especially ZnT8 autoantibodies increases the risk of AITD."
2017,28371195,Intratumoral bidirectional transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition MET, are crucial in several stages of cancer metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition allows cancer cells to move to proximal blood vessels for intravasation. However, because EMT and MET processes are dynamic, mesenchymal cancer cells are likely to undergo MET transiently and subsequently re-undergo EMT to restart the metastatic process. Therefore, spatiotemporally coordinated mutual regulation between EMT and MET could occur during metastasis. To elucidate such regulation, we chose HCC38, a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line, because HCC38 is composed of epithelial and mesenchymal populations at a fixed ratio even though mesenchymal cells proliferate significantly more slowly than epithelial cells. We purified epithelial and mesenchymal cells from Venus-labeled and unlabeled HCC38 cells and mixed them at various ratios to follow EMT and MET. Using this system, we found that the efficiency of EMT is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of MET and that the two populations significantly enhance the transition of cells from the other population to their own. In addition, knockdown of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) or Zinc finger protein SNAI2 (SLUG) significantly suppressed EMT but promoted partial MET, indicating that ZEB1 and SLUG are crucial to EMT and MET. We also show that primary breast cancer cells underwent EMT that correlated with changes in expression profiles of genes determining EMT status and breast cancer subtype. These changes were very similar to those observed in EMT in HCC38 cells. Consequently, we propose HCC38 as a suitable model to analyze EMT-MET dynamics that could affect the development of triple-negative breast cancer."
2006,16880634,The inhibitory effects of eckol and dieckol from Ecklonia stolonifera on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 in human dermal fibroblasts.,"In order to develop new anti-photoaging agents, we examined the inhibitory effects of 29 seaweed extracts on transcriptional activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1, and MMP-1 expression. The extracts from 3 species of Alariaceae, Eisenia bicyclis, Ecklonia cava and Ecklonia stolonifera, have showed strong inhibition of both NF-kappaB and AP-1 reporter activity, which were well correlated with their abilities to inhibit MMP-1 expression. In addition, MMP-1 expression was dramatically attenuated by treatment with eckol or dieckol which were purely isolated from E. stolonifera, indicating that these compounds are active principles to inhibit MMP-1 expression in human dermal fibroblasts. Taken together, our data demonstrate the inhibitory effect of eckol and dieckol from Ecklonia species on MMP-1 expression in human dermal fibroblasts and provide a possibility to develop as an agent for the prevention and treatment of skin aging."
2019,30530601,Direct and Indirect Inhibition Effects of Resveratrol against Toxoplasma gondii Tachyzoites In Vitro.,"Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread obligatory parasitic protozoa and infects nearly all warm-blooded animals, leading to toxoplasmosis. The therapeutic drugs currently administered, like the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, show high rates of toxic side effects, and drug resistance is encountered in some cases. Resveratrol is a natural plant extract with multiple functions, such as antibacterial, anticancer, and antiparasite activities. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on tachyzoites of the Toxoplasma gondii RH strain extracellularly and intracellularly. We demonstrate that resveratrol possesses direct antitoxoplasma activity by reducing the population of extracellularly grown tachyzoites, probably by disturbing the redox homeostasis of the parasites. Moreover, resveratrol was also able to release the burden of cellular stress, promote apoptosis, and maintain the autophagic status of macrophages, which turned out to be regulated by intracellular parasites, thereby functioning indirectly in eliminating T. gondii In conclusion, resveratrol has both direct and indirect antitoxoplasma effects against RH tachyzoites and may possess the potential to be further evaluated and employed for toxoplasmosis treatment."
2010,20202657,DHEA and testosterone therapies in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected rats are associated with thymic changes.,"The ability of the gonadal hormones to influence diverse immunological functions during the course of several infections has been extensively studied in the latest decades. Testosterone has a suppressive effect on immune response of vertebrates and increases susceptibility toward numerous parasitic diseases. Dehydroepiandrosterone is an abundant steroid hormone secreted by the human adrenal cortex and it is considered potent immune-activator. In this paper, it was examined the effects of DHEA and testosterone supplementation in the thymic atrophy in rats infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, by comparing blood parasitism, thymocyte proliferation, TNF-alpha and IL-12 levels. Our data point in the direction that DHEA treatment triggered enhanced thymocyte proliferation as compared to its infected counterparts and reduced production of TNF-alpha during the acute phase of infection. Oppositely, the lowest values for cells proliferation and IL-12 concentrations were reached in testosterone-supplied animals. The combined treatment testosterone and DHEA improves the effectiveness of the host's immune response, reducing blood parasites and the immunosuppressive effects of male androgens besides increasing IL-12 concentrations and decreasing TNF-alpha levels."
1983,6830611,Competitive inhibition by dimethylsulfoxide of molluscan and vertebrate acetylcholinesterase.,"Anticholinesterase-like effects of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were demonstrated on a variety of invertebrate muscles. The excitatory effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on the isolated preparations of the Geukensia demissa heart and anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM), and of the Busycon contrarium radula protractor muscle, were potentiated by DMSO (1-5 microliters/ml; 1 microliter/ml = 14 mM). The negative chronotropic effects of ACh, but not of 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium, were potentiated by DMSO (1-5 microliters/ml) on the isolated heart of the oyster Crassostrea virginica. These four muscles have acetylcholinesterase enzymes of high activity. In contrast, Mercenaria mercenaria hearts have weak cholinesterase activity, and the effects of ACh on this isolated myocardium were not potentiated by DMSO (2-20 microliters/ml). DMSO (0.1-15 microliters/ml) was a competitive inhibitor of both a crude preparation of oyster heart acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (the Km increased 24-fold with DMSO at 15 microliters/ml; the I50 was 1.3 microliters/ml DMSO when [ACh] = Km) and a purified Electrophorus AChE (the Km increased 4.5-fold when DMSO was 10 microliters/ml; the I50 was 10 microliters/ml DMSO near [ACh] = Km). The same doses of DMSO were needed to potentiate the pharmacological effects of ACh on the oyster heart, as to inhibit the AChE of this tissue."
2013,23417770,Sodium chloride enhances cadmium tolerance through reducing cadmium accumulation and increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activity in tobacco.,"The effect of sodium chloride (NaCl) on cadmium (Cd) uptake, translocation, and oxidative stress was investigated using 2 tobacco cultivars differing in Cd tolerance. The growth inhibition of the tobacco plants exposed to Cd toxicity was in part alleviated by moderate addition of NaCl in the culture solution. Cadmium concentration of shoots and roots in the 2 cultivars increased with increasing Cd levels in the solution and decreased with the addition of NaCl. The addition of NaCl could alleviate the oxidative stress caused by Cd toxicity, as reflected by reduced production of malondialdehyde and recovered or enhanced activities of antioxidative enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The results also showed that the enhancement of antioxidative enzyme activity by NaCl for the tobacco plants exposed to Cd stress is related to induced Ca signaling."
2016,27470377,"Chemical composition, efficacy and safety of Pistacia vera (var. Fandoghi) to inactivate protoscoleces during hydatid cyst surgery.","At present, various scolicidal agents have been used for inactivation of protoscoleces during hydatid cyst surgery, however, they are associated with serious adverse side effects including sclerosing colangititis (biliary tract fibrosis), liver necrosis and methaemoglobinaemia. This investigation was designed to evaluate the chemical composition and in vitro scolicidal effects of Pistacia vera (var. Fandoghi) essential oil against protoscoleces of hydatid cysts and also its toxicity in mice model. The components of the P. vera essential oil were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis. Protoscoleces were aseptically aspirated from sheep livers having hydatid cysts. Various concentrations of the essential oil (25-200μl/mL) were used for 5-30min. Viability of protoscoleces was confirmed using eosin exclusion test (0.1% eosin staining). In addition, forty male NIH mice were used to determine the acute and sub-acute toxicity of P. vera essential oil for 2 and 14 days, respectively. The main components of P. vera essential oil were limonene (26.21%), α-pinene (18.07%), α-thujene (9.31%) and α-terpinolene (9.28%). Findings of the present study demonstrated that the P. vera essential oil at the concentrations of 100 and 200μl/mL killed 100% protoscoleces after 10 and 5min of exposure, respectively. The LD50 values of intraperitoneal injection of the P. vera essential oil was 2.69ml/kg body weight, and the maximum nonfatal doses were 1.94ml/kg body weight. No significant difference (P>0.05) was observed in the clinical chemistry and hematological parameters following oral administrations of P. vera essential oil at the doses 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4ml/kg for 14 days. The obtained findings demonstrated new chemical composition and promising scolicidal activity of the P. vera with no significant toxicity which might be used as a natural scolicidal agent in hydatid cyst surgery.

2002,12466045,Cardiovascular pharmacological effects of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid derivatives.,"Tetrandrine, dauricine, daurisoline and neferine are bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid derivatives isolated from Chinese traditional medicine and herbs. The cardiovascular pharmacological effects and the mechanism of actions of these compounds were reviewed. Tetrandrine isolated from Stephania tetrandra S Moore possesses antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects. The antihypertensive effects of tetrandrine have been demonstrated in experimental hypertensive animals and in hypertensive patients. Recent studies showed that in addition to its calcium antagonistic effect, tetrandrine interacted with M receptors. Modulation by M receptor is one of the pharmacological mechanisms of cardiovascular effects of tetrandrine. Dauricine and daurisoloine were isolated from Menispermum dauricum DC. The antiarrhythmic effects of dauricine have been verified in different experimental arrhythmic models and in cardiac arrhythmic patients. Dauricine blocked the cardiac transmembrane Na+,K+ and Ca2+ ion currents. Differing from quinidine and sotalol, which exhibited reverse use-dependent effect, dauricine prolonged APD in a normal use-dependent manner in experimental studies. The antiarrhythmic effect of daurisoline and neferine which is an alkaloid isolated from Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, and their mechanisms of actions have also been studied. The antiarrhythmic effect of daurisoline is more potent than that of dauricine."
2009,19214398,The effects of nano-anatase TiO(2) on the activation of lactate dehydrogenase from rat heart.,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC1.1.1.27), widely expressed in the heart, liver, and other tissues, plays an important role in glycolysis and glyconeogenesis. The activity of LDH is often altered upon inflammatory responses in animals. Nano-TiO(2) was shown to provoke various inflammatory responses both in rats and mice; however, the molecular mechanism by which TiO(2) exerts its toxicity has not been completely understood. In this report, we investigated the mechanisms of nano-anatase TiO(2) (5 nm) on LDH activity in vitro. Our results showed that LDH activity was greatly increased by low concentration of nano-anatase TiO(2), while it was decreased by high concentration of nano-anatase TiO(2). The spectroscopic assays revealed that the nano-anatase TiO(2) particles were directly bound to LDH with mole ratio of [nano-anatase TiO(2)] to [LDH] was 0.12, indicating that each Ti atom was coordinated with five oxygen/nitrogen atoms and a sulfur atoms of amino acid residues with the Ti-O(N) and Ti-S bond lengths of 1.79 and 2.41 A. We postulated that the bound nano-anatase TiO(2) altered the secondary structure of LDH, created a new metal ion-active site for LDH, and thereby enhanced LDH activity."
2003,14581168,"Zinc benzoate, a contaminating environmental compound derived from polystyrene resin inhibits A-type monoamine oxidase.","The contaminants in deionized and distilled water (DDI water) boiled with polystyrene resin inhibited A-type monoamine oxidase (MAO, MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin and norepinephrine and regulates these amines concentration) activity in monkey brain mitochondria. To identify these contaminants, we attempted measurements by HPLC, FT-IR and NMR. The compound inhibiting MAO-A activity was zinc benzoate. Although it potently inhibited MAO-A activity, zinc benzoate did not effect MAO-B in monkey brain mitochondria. It also reversibly and competitively inhibited MAO-A activity in a dose-dependent manner. Zinc benzoate, however, did not inhibit either MAO-A or -B activities in rat brain mitochondria. These results indicate that zinc benzoate, which inhibits MAO-A activity, is easily incorporated in DDI water by boiling polystyrene and also may be a contaminating environmental chemical compound that alters the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system."
2010,19800046,Regeneration of bone marrow after tibial ablation in immunocompromised rats is age dependent.,"Injuries to the marrow cavity result in rapid endosteal bone formation followed by remodeling and regeneration of the marrow. It is not known whether this process is affected by age, although marrow quality is markedly different in young and old animals. To test if marrow regeneration differs with age, we used a bone marrow ablation model that has been used to examine calcification, osteointegration of metal implants, and remodeling of bone graft substitutes. Marrow was ablated in the left tibia of seven immunocompromised rats (rNu/rNu) per time point. At 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days post-surgery, treated and contralateral tibias were harvested and fixed in buffered formalin. Both tibias were scanned using microCT and trabecular and cortical BVF calculated. Mid-sagittal histological sections of the treated limbs were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and BV/TV calculated. MicroCT and histomorphometry showed the greatest increase in bone formation was in young animals and was seen on day 7. Remodeling also occurred at an earlier time point in young rats. Bone formation peaked on day 7 in adult rats, but remodeling was slower than in young rats. Aged animals showed a delay in bone formation. Moreover, aged rats produced less primary bone than younger animals and remodeling was initiated later. These results show that response to injury in immunocompromised rats is reduced in aging and restoration of normal tissue quality is age-dependent."
2013,23194517,Oxidative changes during ice storage of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed different ratios of marine and vegetable feed ingredients.,"Recently fish meal and oil have increasingly been replaced with proteins and oils from vegetable sources in the diets of farmed salmonids, but the consequences for the oxidative stability of the resulting fish products have not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of feeding regime on composition of rainbow trout fillets, as well as on lipid and protein oxidation during storage on ice. Rainbow trout were fed six different diets, which differed in their levels of marine oil and proteins vs. vegetable oil and protein. Fish fillets were characterised by measurement of fatty acid and amino acid composition, primary and secondary lipid oxidation products, astaxanthin and tocopherol content. Protein oxidation was assessed by measuring protein carbonyl content, oxidised amino acids, sulfhydryl groups and immuno-blotting against carbonyl groups. Feeding regimes significantly influenced fatty acid composition. Replacement of fish oil with vegetable oil reduced formation of primary oxidation products, but the effect on secondary oxidation products differed between different types of volatiles. The differences in protein and amino acid composition were not significant, and there were no clear effects of diets on protein oxidation, but data indicated that compounds present in the marine ingredients might have had an effect on protein oxidation."
2011,21787703,"Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) juice modulates 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene induced hepatic but not mammary gland phase I and II enzymes in female rats.","Chokeberry is a rich source of procyanidins known to have several types of biological activity including anticarcinogenic potential in experimental models. In this study we examined the effect of chokeberry juice on the hepatic and mammary gland carcinogen metabolizing enzyme expression altered by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with chokeberry juice (8 ml/kg b.w.) for 28 consecutive days. DMBA was administered i.p. on the 27th and the 28th days. Pretreatment with chokeberry juice reduced the activity of CYP1A1 and increased that of CYP2B involved in metabolic activation/detoxication of DMBA in rat liver, as well as expression and activity of phase II enzymes. Chokeberry juice had no effect on these parameters in the mammary gland and DMBA induced DNA damage in rat blood cells. These results together with our earlier observations indicate that metabolic alterations induced by chokeberry feeding are tissue specific and depend on the class of carcinogen."
2018,30469475,Variation of the Bacterial Community in the Rhizoplane Iron Plaque of the Wetland Plant Typha latifolia.,"The survival of wetland plants in iron, sulfur and heavy metals-rich mine tailing ponds has been commonly attributed to the iron plaque (IP) on the root surface that acts as a protective barrier. However, the contribution of bacteria potentially regulates the iron-sulfur cycle and heavy metal exclusion at the root surface has not been studied in depth, particularly from a microbial ecology perspective. In this study, a pot experiment using Typha latifolia, a typical wetland plant, in non-polluted soil (NP) and tailing soil (T) was conducted. Samples from four zones, comprising non-rhizosphere soil (NR), rhizosphere soil (R) and internal (I) and external (E) layers of iron plaque, were collected from the NP and T and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Simpson index of the genus level showed greater diversities of bacterial community in the NP and its I zone is the most important part of the rhizosphere. PICRUSt predicted that the I zones in both NP and T harbored most of the functional genes. Specifically, functional genes related to sulfur relay and metabolism occurred more in the I zone in the T, whereas those related to iron acquisition and carbon and nitrogen circulation occurred more in the I zone in the NP. Analysis of dominant bacterial communities at genus level showed highest abundance of heavy metal resistant genus Burkholderia in the E zones in both soils, indicating that heavy metal resistance of Typha latifolia driven by Burkholderia mainly occurred at the external layer of IP. Moreover, many bacterial genera, such as Acidithiobacillus, Ferritrophicum, Thiomonas, Metallibacterium and Sideroxydans, involved in iron and sulfur metabolisms were found in the T and most showed higher abundance in the I zone than in the other zones. This work, as the first endeavor to separate the iron plaque into external and internal layers and investigate the variations of the bacterial communities therein, can provide an insight for further understanding the survival strategy of wetland plants, e.g., Typha latifolia, in extreme environment."
2019,29958029,In Vitro Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity and Antibacterial Effects and Measurement of Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of Quercus brantii L. Fruit Extract.,"Plant-based extracts, as alternatives to chemical compounds, are commonly use in pharmaceutical and food industries. Antibacterial properties of extracts are mainly considered in medicine. Because of the high incidence of infectious diseases, it is helpful to identify more agents that are able to treat diseases. Antioxidant effects have been reported for different plant extracts. We aimed to investigate antioxidant activity, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and antibacterial effect of Quercus brantii L. fruit extract. In this study, Q. brantii L. fruit was extracted by maceration using ethanol 70%. Total phenolic content was determined by Folin-Ciocalceu reagent and gallic acid equivalence, and antioxidant activity was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Antibacterial effects were investigated by broth microdilution and measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Then the effects of different concentrations of extract on Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis growth were investigated in comparison with vancomycin and nitrofurantoin. Our findings demonstrate that antioxidant activity of hydroalcoholic extract of Q. brantii L. fruit was more than that of BHT. Total phenolic content was derived (3.010 mg GAE/g DW). Flavonol and flavonoid contents were 1.813 and 0.654 mg/g, respectively. The extract was found to exert significant inhibitory effects on both studied bacteria.

Q. brantii L. fruit extract can exert considerable antioxidant effects, contains high amounts of phenolic, flavonol, and flavonoid compounds, and inhibits bacterial growth."
2020,31084576,"A herbal premix containing Macrotyloma uniflorum, ginger, and whey curtails obesity in rats fed a high-fat diet by a novel mechanism.","The present study designed and evaluated a polyherbal premix comprising Macrotyloma uniflorum, whey protein, Zingiber officinale, and Mentha piperita. Animals were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 days and were daily administered the premix (1.5 g/kg) in milk (PM) and water (PW), aerobic exercise (AE), premix in milk and water along with AE (PMAE and PWAE), ferulic acid (100 mg/kg), and the reference drug fluoxetine (6 mg/kg). All treatments showed significant reduction in food intake, weight gain, abdominal circumference, and body mass index compared with their initial values. All treatments generated a faster peak of the satiety marker cholecystokinin compared with the HFD group and control groups; PMAE and PWAE exhibited sustained satiety. The HFD-elevated blood glucose levels were significantly attenuated on the 30th day by all treatments when compared with their 15th day and basal values; PMAE exhibited the best results. All treatments significantly attenuated the HFD-elevated serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels and significantly restored the HFD-depleted high-density lipoprotein and adiponectin levels. HFD-elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values were attenuated successfully and the HFD-depleted reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase levels were significantly restored by all treatments. The histological findings corroborated the biochemical results. Novelty The polyherbal premix brought about appetite regulation and induction of satiety to control obesity in HFD-fed rats through homeostasis of energy metabolism. The premix along with exercise is a complete way to combat obesity."
2019,30343482,"Effects of Dietary Zinc on Carcass Traits, Meat Quality, Antioxidant Status, and Tissue Zinc Accumulation of Pekin Ducks.","This study investigated the effects of dietary zinc on carcass traits, meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and tissue zinc accumulation of Pekin ducks. A total of 768 1-day-old Pekin ducks were randomly allocated to six dietary treatments and penned in groups of 16 with 8 pens per treatment. Ducks were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet supplemented with graded levels of zinc sulfate (0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 mg zinc/kg) for 35 days. The slaughter weight, carcass weight, eviscerated weight, and breast and leg muscle weight of Pekin ducks were increased with increasing dietary zinc levels (P < 0.05). Zinc supplementation increased the pH value at 24-h postmortem and the intramuscular fat (IMF) (P < 0.05), but decreased the lightness value, drip loss, and shear force in breast meat of ducks (P < 0.05). Increasing dietary zinc increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and the content of glutathione (GSH), as well as decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in breast muscle (P < 0.05). RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that supplemental zinc notably enhanced the transcription of SOD, GPX, GR, CAT, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, zinc accumulation in plasma, breast muscle, liver, and tibia were linearly increased with increasing zinc supplementation (P < 0.05). These results indicated that zinc supplementation could improve carcass traits and meat quality and increase the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes in breast muscle of Pekin duck. Base on broken-line regression analysis that 91.32 mg/kg of dietary zinc was suggested for optimal carcass traits, meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and zinc deposition of Pekin duck."
2017,28159246,Low concentration of sodium bicarbonate improves the bioactive compound levels and antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of tartary buckwheat sprouts.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) on the accumulation of flavonoids, total phenolics and d-chiro-inositol (DCI), as well as the antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities, in tartary buckwheat sprouts. Treatment with low concentrations of NaHCO3 (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2%) resulted in an increase in flavonoids, total phenolic compounds and DCI concentrations, and improved DPPH radical-scavenging and α-glucosidase inhibition activities compared with the control (0%). The highest levels of total flavonoids (26.69mg/g DW), individual flavonoids (rutin, isoquercitrin, quercetin, and kaempferol), total phenolic compounds (29.31mg/g DW), DCI (12.56mg/g DW), as well as antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibition activities, were observed in tartary buckwheat sprouts treated with 0.05% NaHCO3 for 96h. These results indicated that appropriate treatment with NaHCO3 could improve the healthy benefits of tartary buckwheat sprouts."
2008,18505582,Nitric oxide pathway-mediated relaxant effect of aqueous sesame leaves extract (Sesamum radiatum Schum. & Thonn.) in the guinea-pig isolated aorta smooth muscle.,"Sesamum radiatum Schum. & Thonn. (Pedaliaceae) is an annual herbaceous plant, which belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and genus Sesamum. Sesame is used in traditional medicine in Africa and Asia for many diseases treatment. Sesame plant especially the leaves, seed and oil are consumed locally as a staple food by subsistence farmers. The study analyses the relaxation induced by the aqueous extract of leaves from sesame (ESera), compared with those of acetylcholine (ACh) in the guinea-pig aortic preparations (GPAPs), in order to confirm the use in traditional medicine for cardiovascular diseases.The longitudinal strips of aorta of animals were rapidly removed from animals. The aorta was immediately placed in a Mac Ewen solution. Experiments were performed in preparations with intact endothelium as well as in aortae where the endothelium had been removed. The preparations were suspended between two L-shaped stainless steel hooks in a 10 ml organ bath with Mac Ewen solution. The isometric contractile force of the aorta strips of guinea-pig were recorded by using a strain gauge. All both drugs caused concentration-dependent relaxations responses.The aqueous extract of leaves from sesame ESera (1 x 10(-7) - 0.1 microg/ml) caused a graded relaxation in GPAPs with intact endothelium, with a EC50-value of 1 x 10(-4) microg/ml. The same effect was observed with ACh (7 x 10(-2) nM - 7 x 10(-1) microM), which caused relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxation in response to ESera and, like that to ACh in GPAPs without endothelium, was fully abolished. Destruction of the endothelium or incubation with the nitric oxyde synthase inhibitor (L-NNA) significantly enhanced the inhibition of the relaxation response to ESera. Moreover, all concentrations induced vasoconstrictions. However, L-NNA produced a significant displacement to the right (about 65-fold) of the relaxation response to ESera. Similar results were obtained with ACh. Both diclofenac and tetra-ethyl-ammonium (TEA) pretreatment of GPAPs induced a suppression of the relaxation caused by ESera, and produced a very significant rightward shifts of the CRC (16-fold) for diclofenac and increase the Emax. In contract, the relaxation caused by ACh was not significantly affected by diclofenac or by TEA.Thus, the present results indicate clearly that the nitric oxide largely contribute to the relaxation effect of Esera and of ACh in GPAPs. In addition, their contractile effects are also mediated by cyclooxygenase activation, and probably the K+ channels involvement, that confirm the use of various preparations of Esera for the treatments of cardiovascular diseases."
2012,22285266,Amelioration of cyclophosphamide induced myelosuppression and oxidative stress by cinnamic acid.,"Cinnamic acid (C9H8O2), is a major constituent of the oriental Ayurvedic plant Cinnamomum cassia (Family: Lauraceae). This phenolic acid has been reported to possess various pharmacological properties of which its antioxidant activity is a prime one. Therefore it is rational to hypothesize that it may ameliorate myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. Commercial cyclophosphamide, Endoxan, was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss albino mice (50mg/kg) pretreated with 15, 30 and 60mg/kg doses of cinnamic acid orally at alternate days for 15days. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment was found to reduce cyclophosphamide induced hypocellularity in the bone marrow and spleen. This recovery was also reflected in the peripheral blood count. Amelioration of hypocellularity could be correlated with the modulation of cell cycle phase distribution. Cinnamic acid pre-treatment reduced bone marrow and hepatic oxidative stress as evident by lipid peroxidation and activity assays of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. The present study indicates that cinnamic acid pretreatment has protective influence on the myelosuppression and oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide. This investigation is an attempt and is the first of its kind to establish cinnamic acid as an agent whose consumption provides protection to normal cells from the toxic effects of a widely used anti-cancer drug."
2019,30739353,"Investigating the bioavailabilities of olerciamide A via the rat's hepatic, gastric and intestinal first-pass effect models.","Olerciamide A (OA) is a new alkaloid isolated from Portulaca oleracea L. that has been proved to possess a low bioavailability (F) after oral administration in rats in our previous study. Hence, to clarify the reasons for its low bioavailability, hepatic, gastric and intestinal first-pass effect models were established, and a rapid, sensitive UHPLC method was validated and applied for the determination after dosing via the femoral, portal, gastric and intestinal routes. As inhibitors of CYP3A and P-gp, verapamil, midazolam and borneol in low and high dose groups were selected to improve the low bioavailability of olerciamide A. Moreover, a rectal administration method was also carried out to improve the bioavailability of olerciamide A. The results showed that the bioavailability of olerciamide A using hepatic, gastric and intestinal routes were 92.16%, 84.88% and 5.76%, respectively. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0 → ∞ ) were increased a little after being dosed with 10 and 30 mg/kg verapamil (p > 0.05), but markedly increased after being dosed with 0.4 and 1.2 mg/kg midazolam as well as 8 and 24 mg/kg borneol (p < 0.05). Besides, the AUC0 → ∞ values after the lower and upper rectal administrations were separately similar to the intravenous and intraportal administrations. Our study showed that the intestinal first-pass effect mainly contributed to the low bioavailability of olerciamide A in rats due to it being a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp as well as to its poor intestinal absorption."
2009,19249332,Neurodevelopmental effects of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and implications for the reference dose.,"On June 30, 2008, the US EPA's IRIS updated their toxicological review on the 2,2',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenyl ether congener and published a revised oral RfD of 0.007mg/kg day based on a NOAEL for neurobehavioral effects of 2.22mg/kg day, as reported by Viberg, H. et al., 2003b. Neurobehavioral derangements in adult mice receiving decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 209) during a defined period of neonatal brain development. Toxicol. Sci. 76, 112-120 (Comment in: Toxicol. Sci. (2004) 2079, 2205-2206, author reply 2207-2208, Comment in: Toxicol. Sci. (2004) 2081, 2528-2529)], and a total uncertainty factor of 300. To evaluate IRIS' updated RfD, we conducted a weight-of-evidence analysis of developmental neurobehavioral effects. The evidence consists of four studies from two laboratories [Viberg et al., 2003b; Viberg, H. et al., 2007. Changes in spontaneous behaviour and altered response to nicotine in the adult rat, after neonatal exposure to the brominated flame retardant, decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 209), Neurotoxicology 28, 136-142; Johansson, N. et al., 2008. Neonatal exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 209) causes dose-response changes in spontaneous behaviour and cholinergic susceptibility in adult mice. Neurotoxicology; Rice, D.C. et al., 2007. Developmental delays and locomotor activity in the C57BL6/J mouse following neonatal exposure to the fully brominated PBDE, decabromodiphenyl ether, Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 29, 511-520]. The reported effects from these laboratories were in opposite directions - Rice et al. (2007) found mice treated with 20mg/kg day BDE-209 initially had higher activity and an increased habituation, while the Viberg group reported mice and rats treated with >or=20mg/kg BDE-209 (Viberg et al., 2003b, 2007) or mice treated with 2mg/kg BDE-209 (Johansson et al., 2008) had lower initial activity and decreased habituation (although inappropriate statistical methods may have affected results). There was also an overall lack of effects noted in the Functional Observational Battery conducted by Rice et al. (2007). Thus, the Viberg et al. (2003b) study, even in conjunction with other studies, is not suitable for establishing an RfD for BDE-209 or the commercial decabromodiphenyl ether product."
2014,24295670,Dynamics of sterols and fatty acids during UV-B treatment of oyster mushroom.,"Fruiting bodies of the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus were illuminated with UV-B with a light intensity maximum at 310-320 nm and 11.5 W/m² for 60 min at 20 °C. Changes of the sterol and fatty acid spectrum were quantified. The onset of ergocalciferol (vitamin D₂) formation was immediate in fruiting bodies illuminated from the lamella side, in sliced fruiting bodies, and in the stipes. Saturation concentrations above 100 μg/g of dry matter were reached after 1h. At the same time, the concentrations of the photo-isomers lumisterol₂, tachysterol₂ and previtamin D₂ increased in this order. 22-Dihydroergocalciferol (vitamin D₄), showed the same course of increase and reached a maximum concentration of around 20 μg/g dry matter. With the exception of linoleic acid in cut fruiting bodies, fatty acid concentrations remained almost constant. One serving of UV-B pretreated sliced oyster mushroom covered the weekly demand of vitamin D of an adult."
2010,20670297,"Nobiletin, a citrus polymethoxyflavonoid, suppresses multiple angiogenesis-related endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis in vivo.","Nobiletin is a citrus polymethoxyflavonoid that suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, both of which depend on angiogenesis. We recently identified nobiletin as a cell differentiation modulator. Because cell differentiation is a critical event in angiogenesis, it might be possible that nobiletin could exhibit antiangiogenic activity, resulting in suppression of these tumor malignant properties. To verify this possibility, we examined the antiangiogenic effects of nobiletin in vitro and in vivo. Nobiletin had concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on multiple functions of angiogenesis-related endothelial cells (EC); it suppressed the proliferation, migration and tube formation on matrigel of human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) stimulated with endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), a mixture of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Gelatin zymography and northern blotting revealed that nobiletin suppressed pro-matrix metalloproteinase-2 (proMMP-2) production and MMP-2 mRNA expression in ECGS-stimulated HUVEC. Nobiletin also downregulated cell-associated plasminogen activator (PA) activity and urokinase-type PA mRNA expression. Furthermore, nobiletin inhibited angiogenic differentiation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and FGF, an in vitro angiogenesis model. This inhibition was accompanied by downregulation of angiogenesis-related signaling molecules, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and transcriptional factors (c-Jun and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and activation of the caspase pathway. In a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, nobiletin showed an antiangiogenic activity, the ID(50) value being 10μg (24.9nmol) per egg. These results indicate that nobiletin is a novel antiangiogenic compound that exhibits its activity through combined inhibition of multiple angiogenic EC functions."
2013,23993503,Antioxidant versus anti-diabetic properties of leaves from Vernonia amygdalina Del. growing in Malaysia.,"The antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties of the sequential extracts of Vernonia amygdalina based on the chemical composition of the most effective anti-diabetic extract were studied. Using DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging as well as FRAP assays, the extracts showed a consistent dose-dependent trend of potent antioxidant activity in the following solvents: water extract>methanol extract>chloroform extract>and petroleum ether extracts. In the oral glucose tolerance test, the chloroform extract exerted the highest response (33.3%), similar to metformin (27.2%), after 2h compared to the control (50.8%, P<0.05). After a 14-day administration in diabetic rats, the chloroform extract recorded the highest blood (23.5%) and serum (21.4%) glucose-lowering effects (P<0.05). GC-MS analysis of the chloroform extract revealed high levels of linoleic acid (4.72%), α-linolenic acid (10.8%) and phytols (12.0%), as well as other compounds."
2016,27018796,Resveratrol lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats via calcium-dependent endothelial NO production.,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol of natural compounds, has beneficial cardiovascular effects, many of which are mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Resveratrol increases intracellular calcium and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), all of which could increase NO production. We hypothesized that resveratrol via a calcium-dependent NO production lowers blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Acetylcholine (Ach)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in rat aortas were examined by organ chamber. Blood pressures were determined by radiotelemetry methods.Incubation of isolated aortas from SHR with resveratrol dramatically improved vasorelaxation induced by Ach. Preincubation of aortas with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor or calcium chelant blunted the effects of resveratrol on Ach-induced relaxation, as wells as NO production and eNOS phosphorylation. In animal studies, administration of resveratrol significantly lowered systemic BP in SHR.Resveratrol increases endothelial NO production to improve endothelial dysfunction and lowers BP in hypertensive rats, which depends on calcium-eNOS activation."
2018,29864950,Antinociceptive and anti-edema properties of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from extracts of Coriandrum sativum Linn. leaves.,"This study evaluated the antinociceptive and anti-edema properties of fractions of Coriandrum sativum Linn. (Apiaceae/Umbelliferae) leaves in mice. Ethyl acetate fractions (FAc) were obtained from dichloromethane extracts prepared from dried C. sativum (CS) leaves and stems. The effects of different concentrations of FAc on mice were observed using the open-field test, formalin-, capsaicin-, and carrageenan-induced paw edema tests, and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Results from the carrageenan-induced paw edema test were subjected to a linear regression analysis and data from other assays were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test (followed by the SNK post hoc test). Dihydrocoriandrin (34.5%), coriandrin (14.4%), vitamin E (4.6%), and stigmasterol (7.9%) were identified in FAc. The number of squares the mice crossed in the open field test was decreased by 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg FAc (i.p.). The administration of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg FAc induced fewer abdominal writhes than the control. In the formalin test, neurogenic pain was reduced by 20 mg/kg morphine and 30 and 100 mg/kg FAc, but not 5 mg/kg dexamethasone or 10 mg/kg FAc. Formalin-induced inflammatory pain was decreased by morphine, dexamethasone, and 30 and 100 mg/kg FAc. Morphine and 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg FAc significantly decreased the reaction time during the capsaicin test. Dexamethasone reduced both early and later phases of carrageenan-induced edema. Both 30 and 300 mg/kg FAc induced less edema than the control throughout the experiment. FAc showed antinociceptive, anti-edema and anti-inflammatory properties and it may be considered as a potential phytotherapeutic agent in the future."
2009,18507878,"Supplementation with orange and blackcurrant juice, but not vitamin E, improves inflammatory markers in patients with peripheral arterial disease.","Inflammation and endothelial activation are associated with an increased risk of CVD and epidemiological evidence suggests an association between levels of markers of inflammation or endothelial activation and the intake of fruit. Also, vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, has anti-inflammatory properties. We performed a randomised 2 x 2 factorial, crossover trial to determine the effect of orange and blackcurrant juice (500 ml/d) and vitamin E (15 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol/d) supplementation on markers of inflammation and endothelial activation in forty-eight patients with peripheral arterial disease. Patients were randomly allocated to two dietary supplements from the four possible combinations of juice and vitamin E: juice+vitamin E; juice+placebo; reference beverage (sugar drink)+vitamin E; and reference beverage+placebo. The supplementations were given for 28 d, separated by a 4-week wash-out period. Analysis of main effects showed that juice decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) by 11% and fibrinogen by 3% while the reference drink increased CRP by 13% and fibrinogen by 2% (P<0.008 and P<0.002, respectively). No significant differences were measured for IL-6 and the endothelial activation markers von Willebrand factor, tissue-plasminogen activator and plasmin activator inhibitor-1. Vitamin E supplementation had no significant effects on the various markers. We observed no significant interaction between juice and vitamin E. In this study, orange and blackcurrant juice reduced markers of inflammation, but not markers of endothelial activation, in patients with peripheral arterial disease, relative to sugar drinks."
2005,15684505,"Effects of inhaling the vapor of Lavandula burnatii super-derived essential oil and linalool on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), catecholamine and gonadotropin levels in experimental menopausal female rats.","The effects of inhaling the vapor of Lavandula burnatii super-derived essential oil and one of the main components of lavender oil, linalool on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), catecholamine and gonadotropin levels in menopausal model rats under ether-inhalation were studied. The increased plasma ACTH levels induced by ether-inhalation tended to decrease by pre-inhalation of Lavandula burnetii super and linalool vapor was induced the decrease of ACTH level. The decrease in adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine levels induced by ether-inhalation tended to recover, especially, the dopamine level significantly recovered to the normal level by the inhalation of Lavandula burnetii super and linalool vapor. However, the increased plasma gonadotropin levels in ovariectomized retired female rats (menopausal model rats) was significantly decreased by the inhalation of linalool. These results suggest that lavender oil or one of the main components, linalool may contribute to relieving tension and may be applicable to the treatment of menopausal disorders in human beings."
2009,19029965,Alemtuzumab markedly reduces chronic GVHD without affecting overall survival in reduced-intensity conditioning sibling allo-SCT for adults with AML.,"By retrospective analysis of 88 patients from the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, we investigated the effect of in vivo T-cell depletion in HLA-identical sibling reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allografts for adult AML by comparing patients who received alemtuzumab with those without alemtuzumab conditioning. Both groups were equivalent for age, sex, karyotype and disease status at transplant. With a median follow-up of 27 months (3-72 months) and 48 months (7-72 months), the 2- and 5-year overall survival, with or without alemtuzumab, is 60 and 60% (P=0.80) and 61 and 53%, respectively (P=0.85). The 2-year non-relapse mortality is 12% with alemtuzumab, and 17% without alemtuzumab (P=0.49). The 2-year relapse rate is 35% with alemtuzumab compared with 19% without alemtuzumab (P=0.28). Grades II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 22% (8/37) without alemtuzumab compared with 14% (7/51) given alemtuzumab (P=0.25). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 47% (14/30) not given alemtuzumab compared with 4% (2/45) who were given alemtuzumab (P=0.001). Among evaluable patients, the risk of infections was higher in those treated with alemtuzumab compared with those not treated with alemtuzumab (79 vs 57%, respectively, P=0.02). In conclusion, alemtuzumab has a beneficial effect by reducing chronic GVHD without affecting overall survival. Further studies are warranted before alemtuzumab can be recommended as standard in RIC allografts for AML."
1984,6329378,"Human hepatoma cells secrete single chain factor X, prothrombin, and antithrombin III.","The human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, was analyzed for the ability to synthesize and secrete several coagulation proteins. Using specific radioimmunoassays, factor X, prothrombin, and antithrombin III were present in 8-day culture supernatants at 62, 405, and 1,220 ng/mL, respectively. Factor IX was not detected, either in supernatants or in cell extracts. Intrinsically labeled factor X was secreted as a single-chain polypeptide of 66,000 daltons, as measured by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gels under nonreduced and reduced conditions. Immunoblots of Hep G2 supernatants and normal human plasma also indicate the presence of single-chain factor X. These findings support the hypothesis of a postsecretion proteolytic cleavage of factor X into the two-chain form. Prothrombin and antithrombin represented their plasma protein counterparts structurally, with molecular weights of 73,000 and 61,000, respectively. Secreted factor X, prothrombin, and antithrombin III were biologically active, as determined in coagulation or chromogenic assays, and all three activities were neutralized by monospecific antibodies. Vitamin K increased the quantity of prothrombin secreted by twofold, without affecting the rate of secretion over a five-day culture period, and had an apparent transient inhibitory effect on secretion of antithrombin III. Warfarin caused a three to fourfold decrease in the rate and quantity of secreted prothrombin, but did not affect intracellular concentrations. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations and rate of secretion of antithrombin III were not modulated by warfarin. These data suggest that the Hep G2 cell line may provide a useful model for assessing the regulation of biosynthesis and secretion of human coagulation proteins."
2018,30021374,Potent tocolytic activity of ethyl acetate fraction of Ananas comosus on rat and human uteri.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the tocolytic properties of Ananas comosus extract in rat and human uterine tissue in vitro and in the rat in vivo. Organ bath technique was employed to perform functional studies in vitro. The PhysioTel transmitter was implanted in SD rats to measure the changes in intrauterine pressure (IUP) in vivo. Analyses of F2 was performed using LC-HRMS. F2 produced a non-selective inhibitory response on oxytocin, prostaglandin F2α, acetylcholine and KCl. The inhibitory activity of F2 on oxytocin-induced contraction was not attenuated by propranolol, TEA, glibenclamide and indomethacin. Nω-Nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, suppressed the maximal tocolytic activity of F2 by 25%. DIDS, an inhibitor of chloride channels, appeared to suppress the relaxant effect of F2. F2 suppressed the oxytocin-induced contraction in Ca2+ free solution. The in vivo tocolytic activity of F2 and ritodrine were observed in non-pregnant rats during the estrous stage by suppressing the frequency and amplitude of IUP peaks following intrauterine administration. Chemical analysis confirmed the involvement of citric acid in the tocolytic activity of F2. However, another less polar fraction is essential to accompany citric acid to produce such potent inhibitory response of F2. It is likely that F2 exerted tocolytic activity by multiple mechanisms, including antagonizing L-type Ca2+ channels, interfering with the intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism and releasing nitric oxide. F2 would be a promising candidate to develop as a tocolytic agent."
2013,23846143,Formulation and in vitro evaluation of metformin hydrochloride loaded microspheres prepared with polysaccharide extracted from natural sources.,"The present work envisages utilisation of biodegradable and biocompatible material from natural sources for the development of controlled release microspheres of metformin hydrochloride (MetH). Natural polysaccharides extracted from Dillenia indica L. (DI), Abelmoschus esculentus L. (AE) and Bora rice flour were used in fabricating controlled release microspheres. The microspheres were prepared by the emulsion solvent diffusion technique with different proportions of natural materials and were studied for entrapment efficiency, particle size, particle shape, surface morphology, drug excipient compatibility, mucoadhesivity and in vitro release properties. The prepared microspheres showed mucoadhesive properties and controlled release of metformin hydrochloride. The study has revealed that natural materials can be used for formulation of controlled release microspheres and will provide ample opportunities for further study. "
2019,30551504,"The effect of Psidium guajava aqueous leaf extract on liver glycogen enzymes, hormone sensitive lipase and serum lipid profile in diabetic rats.","Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycaemia that results from defects in insulin secretion or insulin action and is accompanied by general disturbances metabolism. Psidium guajava (PG) leaf is known to have antidiabetic effects that include lowering of blood glucose. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of PG leaf extract on tissue activity of glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP); tissue activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL); serum lipid profile; and serum enzyme biomarkers of tissue damage. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight streptozotocin. The aqueous extract of PG leaves was used to treat both normal and diabetic animals (400 mg/kg body weight) for 2 weeks while control animals were treated with the vehicle. At the end of the treatment period, blood, liver and adipose tissue samples were collected from the euthanized animals. The results show that PG extract significantly decreased (P < 0.05) HSL activity in adipose tissue and liver of diabetic animals which was accompanied by increased glycogen levels, reduced serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol. This study demonstrates that P. guajava has significant anti-diabetic effects that include increased glycogen storage and reduced HSL activity in the liver and adipose tissue with an improved serum lipid profile."
2012,23107721,Composition of native Australian herbs polyphenolic-rich fractions and in vitro inhibitory activities against key enzymes relevant to metabolic syndrome.,"Polyphenolic-rich fractions obtained from three native Australian herbs: Tasmannia pepper leaf, anise myrtle and lemon myrtle were characterised with regards to their composition, antioxidant capacities and inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme, using in vitro models. Ellagic acid and derivatives were the dominant compounds of anise myrtle and lemon myrtle fractions, accompanied by flavonoids (catechin, myricetin, hesperetin, and quercetin). Tasmannia pepper leaf fraction comprised chlorogenic acid and quercetin derivatives, exhibited the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity and effectively inhibited α-glucosidase (IC(50): 0.83 mg/ml) and pancreatic lipase (IC(50): 0.60 mg/ml). Anise myrtle and lemon myrtle fractions had pronounced α-glucosidase-inhibitory activities (IC(50): 0.30 and 0.13 mg/ml, respectively) and were less effective against lipase. Enzyme-inhibitory activities showed various levels of correlation with the levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacities, indicating a specificity of individual phenolic compounds present in the isolated fractions to complex with proteins."
2015,25308637,Salicylic acid inhibits enzymatic browning of fresh-cut Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) by competitively inhibiting polyphenol oxidase.,"The inhibitory effect and associated mechanisms of salicylic acid (SA) on the browning of fresh-cut Chinese chestnut were investigated. Shelled and sliced chestnuts were immersed in different concentrations of an SA solution, and the browning of the chestnut surface and interior were inhibited. The activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) extracted from chestnuts were measured in the presence and absence of SA. SA at concentrations higher than 0.3g/L delayed chestnut browning by significantly inhibiting the PPO activity (P<0.01), and the POD activity was not significantly affected (P>0.05). The binding and inhibition modes of SA with PPO and POD, determined by AUTODOCK 4.2 and Lineweaver-Burk plots, respectively, established SA as a competitive inhibitor of PPO. "
2007,17666145,"Dietary chickpeas reverse visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in rats induced by a chronic high-fat diet.","The improved effects of dietary chickpeas on visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance were examined. Rats were fed a normal-fat diet (NFD), a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-fat plus chickpea diet (HFD+CP) for 8 months. The epididymal fat pad weight v. total body weight of rats was higher in the HFD group (0.032 (sd 0.0042) g/g) than in the NFD group (0.015 (sd 0.0064) g/g) and smaller in the HFD+CP group (0.023 (sd 0.0072) g/g) compared with the HFD group (P < 0.05). Chickpea treatment also induced a favourable plasma lipid profile reflecting decreased TAG, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and LDL-C:HDL-cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). HFD-fed rats had higher TAG concentration in muscle and liver, whereas the addition of chickpeas to the HFD drastically lowered TAG concentration (muscle, 39 %; liver, 23 %). The activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in epididymal adipose tissue and hepatic TAG lipase in liver recorded a 40 and 23 % increase respectively in HFD rats compared with those in NFD rats; dietary chickpeas completely normalised the levels. Furthermore, chickpea-treated obese rats also showed a markedly lower leptin and LPL mRNA content in epididymal adipose tissue. An insulin tolerance test, oral glucose tolerance test and insulin-releasing test showed that chickpeas significantly improved insulin resistance, and prevented postprandial hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia induced by the chronic HFD. The present findings provide a rational basis for the consumption of chickpeas as a functional food ingredient, which may be beneficial for correcting dyslipidaemia and preventing diabetes."
2018,29128404,Milk from transgenic goat expressing human lysozyme for recovery and treatment of gastrointestinal pathogens.,"Lysozyme is an important non-specific immune protein in human milk, modulating the immune response against bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to characterize the milk of a transgenic goat expressing a recombinant human lysozyme (rhLZ) in the milk, also testing the in vitro antibacterial activity of the rhLZ milk against pathogens of the gastrointestinal tract. Milk samples collected from Tg and non-transgenic goats (nTg) from the 3rd to the 11th week of lactation were submitted to physicochemical analyses, rhLZ semi-quantification, and to rhLZ antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Shiguella sonnei and Enterococcus faecalis. Viability and cell migration were studied in ileum epithelial cells (IEC-18) in absence or presence of E. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (EPEC) and S. sonnei. The expression of ZO-1 and IL-6 genes was evaluated in IEC-18 to evaluate the effect of rhLZ milk on intestinal barrier function and intestinal inflammation. Physicochemical parameters between goat Tg and nTg milk were similar and within normal values for human consumption, with hLZ concentrations being similar between Tg (224μg/mL) and human (226μg/mL) milk. The Tg milk had bactericidal activity against M. luteus, no bactericidal effect on S. sonnei, and relative to discrete sensitivity against E. feacalis than controls. Better migrating parameters were observed in cells in culture with nTg and Tg than controls. In the presence of pathogens, the Tg milk promoted improved migrating parameters than controls, except for S. sonnei, with lower cell numbers in the presence of nTg samples and E. faecalis and S. sonnei. No differences in ZO-1 relative expression patterns were observed in cultured cells, with increased expression in IL-6 in cells exposed to nTg milk than controls, with the Tg group being similar to all groups. In conclusion, goat milk containing rhLZ demonstrated valid evidence for its potential use as a nutraceutical for improvement of health and nutrition quality in humans."
2000,10939753,Immune response in hemodialysis patients: is there any difference when low and high iPTH levels are compared?,"Chronic renal failure is frequently associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and immunological disorders. Recent studies support the hypothesis that high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) may contribute to the impairment of the cellular and humoral immune response by an immunosuppressive effect on T- and B-cell functions. However, many studies indicate that excess PTH exerts a stimulatory effect on T lymphocytes. Since reports about the immunomodulatory effect of PTH are controversial, our aim was to compare the effect of low and high levels of intact PTH (iPTH) in hemodialysis patients.The study was performed on 14 hemodialysis patients with high levels of iPTH (GI), 12 patients with low levels of iPTH (GII) and 13 volunteers (GIII), for whom time of dialysis, iPTH, total number of lymphocytes, B, CD4+, CD8+, lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and candidin, IgG and IgM production in vitro in response to PWM, and interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6 production in vitro in response to PHA were determined.Patients with high iPTH levels had significantly higher responses to PHA than patients with low iPTH. Lymphocyte transformation by PWM and candidin antigen was similar in both groups of patients, but significantly decreased when compared to controls. CD4+ cell counts were significantly increased in GI, and there was a positive correlation between the lymphoproliferative response to PHA and iPTH levels and CD4+ number.The present study suggests that high levels of iPTH in hemodialysis patients affect T-cell function, increasing the lympho-proliferative response to PHA and the CD4+ number."
2013,23497105,"Anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic effects of red algae Gracilaria changii (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) extract.","Gracilaria changii (Xia et Abbott) Abbott, Zhang et Xia, a red algae commonly found in the coastal areas of Malaysia is traditionally used for foods and for the treatment of various ailments including inflammation and gastric ailments. The aim of the study was to investigate anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic activities of a mass spectrometry standardized methanolic extract of Gracilaria changii.Methanolic extract of Gracilaria changii (MeOHGCM6 extract) was prepared and standardized using mass spectrometry (MS). Anti-inflammatory activities of MeOHGCM6 extract were examined by treating U937 cells during its differentiation with 10 μg/ml MeOHGCM6 extract. Tumour necrosis factors-α (TNF-α) response level and TNF-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression were monitored and compared to that treated by 10 nM betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug. Gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic activities of MeOHGCM6 extract were examined by feeding rats with MeOHGCM6 extract ranging from 2.5 to 500 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) following induction of gastric lesions. Production of mucus and gastric juice, pH of the gastric juice and non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH) levels were determined and compared to that fed by 20 mg/kg b.w. omeprazole (OMP), a known anti-ulcer drug.MS/MS analysis of the MeOHGCM6 extracts revealed the presence of methyl 10-hydroxyphaeophorbide a and 10-hydroxypheophytin a, known chlorophyll proteins and several unidentified molecules. Treatment with 10 μg/ml MeOHGCM6 extract during differentiation of U937 cells significantly inhibited TNF-α response level and TNF-α and IL-6 gene expression. The inhibitory effect was comparable to that of betamethasone. No cytotoxic effects were recorded for cells treated with the 10 μg/ml MeOHGCM6 extract. Rats fed with MeOHGCM6 extract at 500 mg/kg b.w. showed reduced absolute ethanol-induced gastric lesion sizes by > 99% (p < 0.05). This protective effect was comparable to that conferred by OMP. The pH of the gastric mucus decreased in dose-dependent manner from 5.51 to 3.82 and there was a significant increase in NP-SH concentrations.Results from the study, suggest that the mass spectrometry standardized methanolic extract of Gracillaria changii possesses anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic properties. Further examination of the active constituent of the extract and its mechanism of action is warranted in the future."
2010,21092263,"Effects of Hypericum Perforatum, in a rodent model of periodontitis.","Hypericum perforatum is a medicinal plant species containing many polyphenolic compounds, namely flavonoids and phenolic acids. In this study we evaluate the effect of Hypericum perforatum in animal model of periodontitis.Periodontitis was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing a nylon thread ligature around the lower 1st molars. Hypericum perforatum was administered at the dose of 2 mg/kg os, daily for eight days. At day 8, the gingivomucosal tissue encircling the mandibular first molar was removed.Periodontitis in rats resulted in an inflammatory process characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production that was followed by the recruitment of other inflammatory cells, production of a range of inflammatory mediators such as NF-κB and iNOS expression, the nitration of tyrosine residues and activation of the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; apoptosis and the degree of gingivomucosal tissues injury. We report here that Hypericum perforatum exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects significantly reducing all of the parameters of inflammation as described above.Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that treatment with Hypericum reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury, events associated with periodontitis."
1998,9805364,Chemical structure of antithrombin-active Rhamnan sulfate from Monostrom nitidum.,"Rhamnan sulfate was extracted with boiling water from the cell wall of Monostroma nitridum, and the resulting extract was purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The polysaccharide, which is regarded as a homopolysaccharide, was 6-fold more antithrombin-active than the heparin standard. The antithrombin activity was decreased, by desulfation, although the non-active product still retained 8% of the sulfate ester. A comparative structural study of the intact rhamnan sulfate and rhamnan, its desulfated product, by periodate oxidation, Smith degradation and methylation analysis revealed the rhamnan sulfate to consist of alpha-1,3-linked L-rhamnose residues, some of which were substituted with sulfate groups mainly at position O-2. Minor amounts of internal 1,2-linked rhamnose and branched rhamnose linkages were also detected."
2017,28274422,Antioxidant and functional properties of protein hydrolysates obtained from squid pen chitosan extraction effluent.,"Squid pens were subjected to alkali hydrolysis to extract chitin and chitosan. Proteins present in the alkaline extraction wastewater were recovered at pH 3, 4, 5 and 6, and were subjected to hydrolysis by trypsin, pepsin and a bacterial protease called HT for 1, 2, 4 and 24h. Hydrolysis of the extracted proteins with either trypsin or HT generated more antioxidant activity than hydrolysis with pepsin. Higher ACE-inhibitory activity was generated in the trypsin and pepsin hydrolysates than in the HT hydrolysate. Squid pen protein recovered from chitosan processing waste alkaline solution can be a potential source of bioactive peptides for addition to foods. The antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of the extracted proteins were initially low and increased upon incubation with the proteases. Pepsin generated significantly lower (P<0.05) antioxidant activities compared to trypsin and HT, while trypsin and pepsin hydrolysates exhibited higher ACE-inhibitory activity than HT (P<0.05)."
2016,26304373,The challenging SO2-mediated chemical build-up of protein aggregates in wines.,"Despite the extensive research performed during the last decades, the multifactorial mechanism responsible for white wine protein haze formation is not fully characterized. A model is proposed, which is essentially based on two postulates: the experimental identification of sulfur dioxide as the non-proteinaceous factor, and the inference from reliable data available in the literature of the dynamic chemistry played by wine protein sulfhydryl groups. Unlike other reducing agents, addition of SO2 to must/wine upon heating cleaves intraprotein disulfide bonds, hinders thiol-disulfide exchange during protein interactions, and leads to formation of novel interprotein disulfide bonds. These bonds are ultimately responsible for wine protein aggregation following a nucleation-growth kinetic model, as shown by Dynamic Light Scattering experiments. The model was tested in wine model solution (using total and fractionated wine proteins) and validated under real wine conditions. The results achieved may open the way to develop techniques that will find wide application in the wine industry. "
2005,16327179,Soy isoflavone aglycone modulates a hematopoietic response in combination with soluble beta-glucan: SCG.,"Soy isoflavone aglycones (IFAs) have a wide range of biological actions that suggest they may be of use in cancer prevention. On the other hand, a branched beta-glucan from Sparassis crispa (SCG) is a major 6-branched 1,3-beta-D-glucan in an edible/medicinal mushroom: Sparassis crispa showing antitumor activity. We have previously reported that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of SCG enhanced the hematopoietic response in cyclophosphamide (CY)-induced leukopenic mice. In this study, we investigated the hematopoietic response due to IFA in combination with SCG in CY-induced leukopenic mice. The oral administration of IFA in combination with SCG synergistically enhanced the number of white blood cells, and increased spleen weight. Analyzing the leukocyte population by flow cytometry, the combination of IFA and SCG increased the number of monocytes and granulocytes in the spleen. Taken together, the combination of IFA and SCG synergistically provides the hematopoietic responses that are enhanced over IFA or SCG alone."
2009,19734659,Exogenous proline and glycinebetaine suppress apoplastic flow to reduce Na(+) uptake in rice seedlings.,"The application of exogenous proline and glycinebetaine (betaine) confers salt tolerance on plants under salt stress. The effects of exogenous proline and betaine on apoplastic flow in rice plants under saline conditions were investigated using trisodium-8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), an apoplastic tracer. Rice plants took up more PTS under light conditions than under dark conditions. Salt stress increased PTS uptake and Na(+) content of rice leaves, but did not affect K(+) content, resulting in a lower K(+)/Na(+) ratio. Addition of proline or betaine to the saline medium suppressed Na(+)-induced PTS uptake and Na(+) accumulation, while the K(+) content was slightly increased, which led to a high K(+)/Na(+) ratio under saline conditions. These results suggest that exogenous proline and betaine suppressed Na(+)-enhanced apoplastic flow to reduce Na(+) uptake in rice plants."
2012,22619603,In vitro synergistic effect of Psidium guineense (Swartz) in combination with antimicrobial agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of aqueous extract of Psidium guineense Swartz (Araçá-do-campo) and five antimicrobials (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem) against twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus with a resistant phenotype previously determined by the disk diffusion method. Four S. aureus strains showed resistance to all antimicrobial agents tested and were selected for the study of the interaction between aqueous extract of P. guineense and antimicrobial agents, by the checkerboard method. The criteria used to evaluate the synergistic activity were defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). All S. aureus strains were susceptible to P. guineense as determined by the microdilution method. The combination of the P. guineense extract with the antimicrobial agents resulted in an eight-fold reduction in the MIC of these agents, which showed a FICI ranging from 0.125 to 0.5, suggesting a synergistic interaction against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The combination of the aqueous extract of P. guineense with cefoxitin showed the lowest FICI values. This study demonstrated that the aqueous extract of P. guineense combined with beta lactamics antimicrobials, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems, acts synergistically by inhibiting MRSA strains."
2019,31547810,Anti-inflammatory activities of astringent persimmons (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) stalks of various cultivar types based on the stages of maturity in the Gyeongnam province.,"Natural products play a significant role in human health in relation to the prevention and treatment of inflammatory conditions. One of the plants with great medicinal potentials is Diospyros kaki which is mainly cultivated in Asian countries including Korea, Japan, and China. Astringent D. kaki is a wild species with an astringent taste until they are Ripened. kaki calyx is a traditional Korean medicine (TKM) made from the stalks of astringent D. kaki and is used in treating bed-wetting, vomiting, and hiccupping. The present study was designed to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory activities of astringent D. kaki stalks based on cultivar types and stages of maturity.The anti-inflammatory effects of the stalk extracts of local astringent D. kaki cultivar species were evaluated on RAW 264.7 cells. Cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method. The anti-inflammatory effects were determined by measuring the nitric oxide (NO) concentration of the supernatant. Cellular signaling pathways were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reactions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Protein expression of iNOS and phospho-p65 was determined using western blot, and the nuclear localization of p65 was determined using confocal imaging in RAW 264.7 cells.We found that the stage 1 (8-9 month) samples all showed a high percentage of tannic acid content and Gojongsi (Hamyang) stalks had the highest content. The stage 1 samples also showed the highest inhibition of NO production. Decreases in the expression of iNOS and phosphorylated p65, and in the nuclear localization of p65, were dose-dependent. All the extracts were nontoxic under 100 μg/ml concentration.This study provides insight into the changes in tannic acid content in astringent D. kaki and their anti-inflammatory effects, in relation to their stage of maturity. These results are expected to be useful in the verification of the efficacy of oriental medicine and the timing of proper harvest for medical use."
1986,2943148,Immunologic studies of peripheral blood from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Immune function, T-lymphocyte subsets, serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels, serum lysozyme levels, and circulating immune complex levels were analyzed in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). The percentage of helper/inducer T cells (OKT4) was higher and the percentage of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (OKT8) was lower in IDCM patients than in healthy controls and in patients with ischemic heart disease. IDCM patients, in addition, have higher 5/9+ T cells, a T-cell subset known to give maximal helper activity in B-cell differentiation assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from IDCM patients demonstrated a statistically greater ability to induce B-cell differentiation (helper T-cell function) into plasma cells and a hypofunctioning suppressor T-cell population in an in vitro pokeweed nitrogen (PWN)-driven B-cell differentiation assay. Serum immunoglobulin IgM levels were higher in IDCM patients, but serum lysozyme levels and serum immune complex levels in IDCM patients were normal. These data verify that an immunoregulatory defect exists in IDCM."
1992,1609761,Effect of vitamin A and zinc supplementation on the nutriture of children in Northeast Thailand.,"Previous surveys suggested that young children in Northeast Thailand may benefit from vitamin A and/or zinc supplementation. One hundred thirty-three children aged 6-13 y with marginal plasma retinol (less than 1.05 mumol/L) and Zn (less than 12.2 mumol/L) concentrations participated in a double-blind study. They were randomly assigned and supplemented with either zinc (25 mg/d), vitamin A (1500 RE/d), zinc plus vitamin A, or placebo for 6 mo. Biochemical indices of vitamin A (plasma vitamin A, retinol-binding protein) and zinc status (plasma zinc, alkaline phosphatase) increased significantly. The children had adequate liver stores of vitamin A (relative dose response less than 20%). Zinc supplementation resulted in an improvement in vision restoration time (VRT) in dim light (dark adaptometry). Vitamin A and zinc synergistically normalized conjunctival epithelium as measured by conjunctival impression cytology (CIC). Both functional indices, VRT and CIC, showed significant correlations with plasma zinc and vitamin A, respectively. The data suggest that functional improvements in populations with suboptimal vitamin A and zinc nutriture can be accomplished by supplementation with less than two times the recommended dietary allowance of these nutrients."
1997,9209169,beta-Carotene in breast milk and serum is increased after a single beta-carotene dose.,"Normal lactating mothers were administered a single dose of 60 or 210 mg beta-carotene and changes in serum and milk retinol, alpha-tocopherol, and carotenoids were monitored for 8 d. Average serum beta-carotene concentrations increased 4.1- and 4.0-fold after the 60- and 210-mg doses, respectively. Milk beta-carotene concentrations increased 4.1- and 3.0-fold after the 60- and 210-mg doses, respectively. Maximum serum concentrations were reached 24 h after both supplements, although concentrations of milk beta-carotene continued to rise for 2-3 d. After 8 d, both serum and milk beta-carotene continued to rise for 2-3 d. After 8 d, both serum and milk beta-carotene concentrations remained about twofold higher than baseline concentrations. Increases in serum or milk beta-carotene concentrations were not dose-dependent. Initial serum and milk concentrations of beta-carotene predicted increases after supplementation, and increases in serum beta-carotene concentrations predicted those in milk. Concentrations of milk carotenoids were less than one-tenth their respective concentrations in serum. Lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, alpha-carotene, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol concentrations in serum or milk did not change significantly after beta-carotene supplementation. Retinol esters account for most of the retinol equivalents in the milk of well-nourished mothers. Initial and maximum concentrations of beta-carotene in serum and milk were strongly correlated for individual mothers. Collectively, the data showed that a single 60-mg supplement of beta-carotene sustained elevated beta-carotene concentrations in serum and milk for > 1 wk in normal mothers but did not affect concentrations of other major carotenoids, retinol, or alpha-tocopherol."
2016,27661399,"Relative Bioavailabilities of Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate and D-Amphetamine in Healthy Adults in an Open-Label, Randomized, Crossover Study After Mixing Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate With Food or Drink.","This open-label, crossover study examined lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and D-amphetamine pharmacokinetics in healthy adults after administration of an intact LDX capsule or after the capsule was emptied into orange juice or yogurt and the contents consumed.Healthy adult volunteers (N = 30) were administered a 70-mg LDX capsule or the contents of a 70-mg capsule mixed with yogurt or orange juice using a 3-way crossover design. Blood samples were collected serially for up to 96 hours after dose. Pharmacokinetic endpoints included maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) or to last assessment (AUClast). Relative LDX and D-amphetamine bioavailabilities from the contents of a 70-mg LDX capsule mixed with orange juice or yogurt were compared with those from the intact LDX capsule using bioequivalence-testing procedures.Geometric least squares mean ratios (90% confidence intervals [CIs]) for D-amphetamine (active moiety) were within the prespecified bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25) when the contents of a 70-mg LDX capsule were mixed with orange juice [Cmax: 0.971 (0.945, 0.998); AUC0-∞: 0.986 (0.955, 1.019); AUClast: 0.970 (0.937, 1.004)] or yogurt [Cmax: 0.970 (0.944, 0.997); AUC0-∞: 0.945 (0.915, 0.976); AUClast: 0.944 (0.912, 0.977)]. Geometric least squares mean ratios (90% CIs) for LDX (inactive prodrug) were below the accepted range when the contents of a 70-mg LDX capsule were mixed with orange juice [Cmax: 0.641 (0.582, 0.707); AUC0-∞: 0.716 (0.647, 0.792); AUClast: 0.708 (0.655, 0.766)]; the lower 90% CI for Cmax [0.828 (0.752, 0.912)] was below the accepted range when the contents of a 70-mg LDX capsule were mixed with yogurt.Relative bioavailability of D-amphetamine (the active moiety) did not differ across administrations, which suggests that emptying an LDX capsule into orange juice or yogurt and consuming it is an alternative to intact capsules."
2019,31140960,How are maternal dietary patterns and maternal/fetal cytokines associated with birth weight? A path analysis.,"The aim of the study was to investigate how maternal dietary patterns and maternal/fetal cytokines are associated with birth weight and whether cytokines mediate the association. A total of 469 pregnant women and their children were recruited for this prospective study. Dietary patterns in pregnancy were identified using factor analysis of data from three consecutive 24 h dietary recalls. Maternal and umbilical blood serum cytokines (adiponectin (APN), IL-6 and interferon-γ) were measured via ELISA. Path analysis was used to explore the relationships between maternal diet, cytokines and birth weight. Four dietary patterns were identified: a mainly fruit, dairy products and poultry diet (FDP); a mainly vegetables, beans and pork diet (VBP); a mainly fish, shrimp and soup diet (FS) and a mainly tuber and egg diet (TE). Path analysis showed the order of effects of dietary patterns on birth weight was FS&gt;FDP&gt;TE&gt;VBP (β=0·130, 0·109, -0·094 and 0·046, respectively). Only the TE pattern's effect was negative. Maternal and fetal APN were positively associated with birth weight (β=0·045 and 0·226, respectively), and they mediated the association between the TE pattern and birth weight (indirect effect was 5·3 %). Maternal IL-6 was negatively associated with birth weight (β=-0·067) and mediated the association between maternal FDP and VBP patterns and birth weight (indirect effects were 10·1 and 100·0 %, respectively). All variables in the path explained 33·6 % of variation. These results suggested that maternal dietary patterns in pregnancy are associated with birth weight and mediated directly and indirectly through some maternal/fetal serum cytokines."
2016,26899752,Does Long-Term Furosemide Therapy Cause Thiamine Deficiency in Patients with Heart Failure? A Focused Review.,"Diuretic therapy is a cornerstone in the management of heart failure. Most studies assessing body thiamine status have reported variable degrees of thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure, particularly those treated chronically with high doses of furosemide. Thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure seems predominantly to be due to increased urine volume and urinary flow rate. There is also evidence that furosemide may directly inhibit thiamine uptake at the cellular level. Limited data suggest that thiamine supplementation is capable of increasing left ventricular ejection fraction and improving functional capacity in patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who were treated with diuretics (predominantly furosemide). Therefore, it may be reasonable to provide such patients with thiamine supplementation during heart failure exacerbations."
2009,20329704,Isolation and characterization of indole acetic acid (IAA) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and their effect on plant growth.,"The present study was undertaken for isolation of Klebsiella strains from rhizosphere of wheat (T. aestivum), screening and characterization of these strains for in vitro indole acetic acid (IAA) production and studying the effect of these strains on plant growth under gnotobiotic conditions. Nine strains of Klebsiella were isolated from rhizosphere of wheat (var. Lokwan) and identified as K. pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six K. pneumoniae strains showed in vitro IAA production. Colorimetric analysis showed that K8 produced maximum IAA (27.5 mg l(-1)) in the presence of tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) at 72 h of incubation with optimum conditions as pH 8.0, 37 degrees C and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl concentration. GC-MS analysis and IR studies confirmed presence of IAA in the cell filtrates of strain K8. Effect of six IAA producing Klebsiella strains on plant growth was studied by performing series of seed germination tests using moth bean seeds under axenic conditions and pot experiments using sterilized soil and wheat seeds (var. Lokwan). Strain K11 and K42 demonstrated increase in root length of inoculated moth beans (approximately 92.71% over the control). Results of pot experiments indicated that almost all the six IAA producing Klebsiella strains significantly increased the root length and shoot height of inoculated wheat seedlings over the control. The results suggest that these are promising isolates from wheat rhizosphere and merits research on appliance of these strains in agriculture."
2010,21341541,Hepatoprotective activity of Luffa acutangula against CCl4 and rifampicin induced liver toxicity in rats: a biochemical and histopathological evaluation.,"Hepatoprotective activity of hydroalcoholic extract of Luffa acutangula (HAELA) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats was evaluated and probable mechanism(s) of action has been suggested. Administration of standard drug- silymarin and HAELA showed significant hepatoprotection against CCl4 and rifampicin induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Hepatoprotective activity of HAELA was due to the decreased levels of serum marker enzymes viz., (AST, ALT, ALP and LDH) and increased total protein including the improvement in histoarchitecture of liver cells of the treated groups as compared to the control group. HAELA also showed significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, increased activity of non-enzymatic intracellular antioxidant, glutathione and enzymatic antioxidants, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Results of this study demonstrated that endogenous antioxidants and inhibition of lipid peroxidation of membrane contribute to hepatoprotective activity of HAELA."
2011,22700073,First case report of testosterone assay-interference in a female taking maca (Lepidium meyenii).,"A young female with prolonged intermenstrual bleeding was found to have raised total plasma testosterone of 25.8 nmol/l (NR<2.9 nmol/l) using the Roche Elecsys Testosterone I immunoassay without clinical features of virulisation. Few months ago investigations for lethargy and low libido had shown normal total testosterone of 0.8 nmol/l. Further history revealed that she was using maca extract to improve her lethargy and low libido. Maca is traditionally used for its aphrodisiac and fertility-enhancing properties. Maca use has not been shown to affect serum testosterone in mice and human studies. Immunoassay interference with maca was suspected. Testosterone immunoassays use monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against testosterone. They are prone to interference from androgenic compounds. Reanalysis of the original serum sample using Elecsys Testosterone II assay, a higher affinity assay, revealed a total testosterone level of 2.9 nmol/l. It is important to exclude assay interference when testosterone level is greater than 5 nmol/l without supportive clinical signs."
2005,15863912,Hypoglycemic effects of turmeric (Curcuma longa L. rhizomes) on genetically diabetic KK-Ay mice.,"The turmeric (Curcuma longa L. rhizomes) EtOH extract significantly suppressed an increase in blood glucose level in type 2 diabetic KK-A(y) mice. In an in vitro evaluation, the extract stimulated human adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and showed human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma ligand-binding activity in a GAL4-PPAR-gamma chimera assay. The main constituents of the extract were identified as curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and ar-turmerone, which had also PPAR-gamma ligand-binding activity. These results indicate that turmeric is a promising ingredient of functional food for the prevention and/or amelioration of type 2 diabetes and that curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and ar-turmerone mainly contribute to the effects via PPAR-gamma activation."
2015,25482167,DA-9801 promotes neurite outgrowth via ERK1/2-CREB pathway in PC12 cells.,"In the present study, we examined the mechanisms underlying the effect of DA-9801 on neurite outgrowth. We found that DA-9801 elicits its effects via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway. DA-9801, an extract from a mixture of Dioscorea japonica and Dioscorea nipponica, was reported to promote neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The effects of DA-9801 on cell viability and expression of neuronal markers were evaluated in PC12 cells. To investigate DA-9801 action, specific inhibitors targeting the ERK signaling cascade were used. No cytotoxicity was observed in PC12 cells at DA-9801 concentrations of less than 30 µg/mL. In the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF, 2 ng/mL), DA-9801 promoted neurite outgrowth and increased the relative mRNA levels of neurofilament-L (NF-L), a marker of neuronal differentiation. The Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074 and MEK inhibitor PD98059 significantly attenuated DA-9801-induced neurite outgrowth. Additionally, the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor SL327 significantly attenuated the increase in the percentage of neurite-bearing PC12 cells induced by DA-9801 treatment. Conversely, the selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 did not attenuate the DA-9801 treatment-induced increase in the percentage of neurite-bearing PC12 cells. DA-9801 enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB in PC12 cells incubated with and without NGF. Pretreatment with PD98059 blocked the DA-9801-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB. In conclusion, DA-9801 induces neurite outgrowth by affecting the ERK1/2-CREB signaling pathway. Insights into the mechanism underlying this effect of DA-9801 may suggest novel potential strategies for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy."
2008,18083845,Bortezomib induces DNA hypomethylation and silenced gene transcription by interfering with Sp1/NF-kappaB-dependent DNA methyltransferase activity in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Bortezomib reversibly inhibits 26S proteasomal degradation, interferes with NF-kappaB, and exhibits antitumor activity in human malignancies. Zinc finger protein Sp1 transactivates DNMT1 gene in mice and is functionally regulated through protein abundance, posttranslational modifications (ie, ubiquitination), or interaction with other transcription factors (ie, NF-kappaB). We hypothesize that inhibition of proteasomal degradation and Sp1/NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation may impair aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity. We show here that, in addition to inducing accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and abolishment of NF-kappaB activities, bortezomib decreases Sp1 protein levels, disrupts the physical interaction of Sp1/NF-kappaB, and prevents binding of the Sp1/NF-kappaB complex to the DNMT1 gene promoter. Abrogation of Sp1/NF-kappaB complex by bortezomib causes transcriptional repression of DNMT1 gene and down-regulation of DNMT1 protein, which in turn induces global DNA hypomethylation in vitro and in vivo and re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes in human cancer cells. The involvement of Sp1/NF-kappaB in DNMT1 regulation is further demonstrated by the observation that Sp1 knockdown using mithramycin A or shRNA decreases DNMT1 protein levels, which instead are increased by Sp1 or NF-kappaB overexpression. Our results unveil the Sp1/NF-kappaB pathway as a modulator of DNA methyltransferase activity in human cancer and identify bortezomib as a novel epigenetic-targeting drug."
2015,25603021,"Silymarin and hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic, comprehensive, and critical review.","The blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum L.), a flowering plant native to Mediterranean Europe, has been consumed and extensively used as a cure for various chronic liver ailments over several centuries. Milk thistle extract, known as silymarin, is a complex mixture of seven major flavonolignans and one flavonoid. The phytoconstituents of silymarin owe their therapeutic and hepatoprotective effects to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), occurs in a milieu of oxidative stress and inflammation. The etiology of HCC includes chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses, cirrhosis, and exposure to dietary and environmental hepatocarcinogens. Current therapeutic options for HCC, including surgical resection and liver transplantation, have limited benefits and are essentially ineffective. Chemoprevention, using phytochemicals with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, represents a fascinating strategy, which has been a subject of intense investigation in the recent years. In this review, we explore the potential role of silymarin as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for HCC. The review systematically evaluates the preclinical in-vitro and in-vivo studies investigating the effects of silymarin and its constituents on HCC. The biochemical mechanisms involved in the anti-liver-cancer effects of silymarin have been presented. The current status of clinical studies evaluating the potential of role of silymarin in liver cancer, especially that caused by hepatitis C virus, has also been examined. Potential challenges and future directions of research involved in the 'bench-to-bedside' transition of silymarin phytoconstituents for the chemoprevention and treatment of HCC have also been discussed.

2013,24046012,Effector T cells require fatty acid metabolism during murine graft-versus-host disease.,"Activated T cells require increased energy to proliferate and mediate effector functions, but the metabolic changes that occur in T cells following stimulation in vivo are poorly understood, particularly in the context of inflammation. We have previously shown that T cells activated during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation to synthesize adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Here, we demonstrate that alloreactive effector T cells (Teff) use fatty acids (FAs) as a fuel source to support their in vivo activation. Alloreactive T cells increased FA transport, elevated levels of FA oxidation enzymes, up-regulated transcriptional coactivators to drive oxidative metabolism, and increased their rates of FA oxidation. Importantly, increases in FA transport and up-regulation of FA oxidation machinery occurred specifically in T cells during GVHD and were not seen in Teff following acute activation. Pharmacological blockade of FA oxidation decreased the survival of alloreactive T cells but did not influence the survival of T cells during normal immune reconstitution. These studies suggest that pathways controlling FA metabolism might serve as therapeutic targets to treat GVHD and other T-cell-mediated immune diseases. "
2014,24491736,A new chemical criteria for white wine: the glutathione equivalent capacity.,"The present work aimed at showing the interest in applying liquid chromatography with amperometric detection at a silver electrode (LC-EC-Ag) in order to record a chromatogram highly selective to non volatile aminothiols present in white wines. By integrating and summing the peak area of the aminothiols and by normalizing with respect to the peak area of an injected standard solution of glutathione (1 μM) a new quantitative criteria for white wine characterization is proposed namely, the glutathione equivalent capacity (GEC). The LC setup uses a C18 column in isocratic mode and the analysis takes less than 4 min. The wine sample needs no sample treatment other than dilution with the mobile phase. This new methodology and concept is illustrated by the LC-EC-Ag analysis of several white wines of different origins especially Alsace Riesling wines and Riesling grape juice. It is anticipated that in addition to the determination of the GEC, the developed method may be of interest for establishing a white wine ""signature"" based on the chromatographic profile."
2013,23086307,C-phycocyanin modulates selenite-induced cataractogenesis in rats.,"The present investigation is aimed to evaluate the anticataractogenic potential of C-phycocyanin (C-PC), extracted and purified from Spirulina platensis. Enucleated rat lenses were maintained in vitro in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Group I contained DMEM, Group II and Group III contained 100 μM of sodium selenite, Group III was subdivided into three viz IIIa, IIIb, IIIc supplemented with 100, 150, 200 μg of C-PC respectively. In the in vivo study, on tenth day post partum: Group I rat pups received an intraperitoneal injection of saline, Group II, IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc rat pups received a subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite (19 μmol/kg bodyweight) Group IIIa, IIIb, IIIc also received an intraperitoneal injection of 100, 150, 200 mg/kg body weight of C-PC, respectively, from postpartum days 9-14. On termination of the experiment, the lenses from both in vitro and in vivo studies were subjected to morphological examination and subsequently processed to estimate the activities of antioxidant enzymes namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, levels of reduced glutathione and lipid peroxidation products. Sodium selenite-exposed, C-PC-treated rat lenses (Group IIIc), showed significant restoration of antioxidant enzyme activity (p < 0.05) when compared to their counterpart Group II. Group IIIc conserved the levels of GSH and lipid peroxidation products at near to normal levels as compared with Group II. Results conclude the possible role of C-PC in modulating the antioxidant enzyme status, thereby retarding sodium selenite-induced cataract incidence both in vitro and in vivo."
1998,9797214,MIC-based interspecies prediction of the antimicrobial effects of ciprofloxacin on bacteria of different susceptibilities in an in vitro dynamic model.,"Multiple predictors of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial effects (AMEs) are not usually examined simultaneously in most studies. To compare the predictive potentials of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-to-MIC ratio (AUC/MIC), the AUC above MIC (AUCeff), and the time above MIC (Teff), the kinetics of killing and regrowth of four bacterial strains exposed to monoexponentially decreasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin were studied in an in vitro dynamic model. The MICs of ciprofloxacin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli 11775 (I) and 204 (II), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.6, 0.013, 0.08, and 0.15 microg/ml, respectively. The simulated values of AUC were designed to provide similar 1,000-fold (S. aureus, E. coli I, and P. aeruginosa) or 2, 000-fold (E. coli II) ranges of the AUC/MIC. In each case except for the highest AUC/MIC ratio, the observation periods included complete regrowth in the time-kill curve studies. The AME was expressed by its intensity, IE (the area between the control growth and time-kill and regrowth curves up to the point where the viable counts of regrowing bacteria are close to the maximum values observed without drug). For most AUC ranges the IE-AUC curves were fitted by an Emax (maximal effect) model, whereas the effects observed at very high AUCs were greater than those predicted by the model. The AUCs that produced 50% of maximal AME were proportional to the MICs for the strains studied, but maximal AMEs (IEmax) and the extent of sigmoidicity (s) were not related to the MIC. Both Teff and log AUC/MIC correlated well with IE (r2 = 0.98 in both cases) in a species-independent fashion. Unlike Teff or log AUC/MIC, a specific relationship between IE and log AUCeff was inherent in each strain. Although each IE and log AUCeff plot was fitted by linear regression (r2 = 0.97 to 0.99), these plots were not superimposed and therefore are bacterial species dependent. Thus, AUC/MIC and Teff were better predictors of ciprofloxacin's AME than AUCeff. This study suggests that optimal predictors of the AME produced by a given quinolone (intraquinolone predictors) may be established by examining its AMEs against bacteria of different susceptibilities. Teff was shown previously also to be the best interquinolone predictor, but unlike AUC/MIC, it cannot be used to compare different quinolones. AUC/MIC might be the best predictor of the AME in comparisons of different quinolones."
2011,20727238,Gold kiwifruit consumed with an iron-fortified breakfast cereal meal improves iron status in women with low iron stores: a 16-week randomised controlled trial.,"Ascorbic acid, and more recently, the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to enhance Fe absorption. However, it is not clear whether Fe status improves when foods high in ascorbic acid and carotenoids are consumed with Fe-fortified meals. The present study aimed to investigate whether consuming high v. low ascorbic acid-, lutein- and zeaxanthin-rich fruit (gold kiwifruit v. banana) with Fe-fortified breakfast cereal and milk improved Fe status in women with low Fe stores. Healthy women aged 18-44 years (n 89) with low Fe stores (serum ferritin ≤ 25 μg/l and Hb ≥ 115 g/l) were randomly stratified to receive Fe-fortified breakfast cereal (16 mg Fe as ferrous sulfate), milk and either two gold kiwifruit or one banana (164 mg v. not detectable ascorbic acid; 526 v. 22·90 μg lutein and zeaxanthin, respectively) at breakfast every day for 16 weeks. Biomarkers of Fe status and dietary intake were assessed at baseline and end in the final sample (n 69). Median serum ferritin increased significantly in the kiwifruit group (n 33) compared with the banana group (n 36), with 10·0 (25th, 75th percentiles 3·0, 17·5) v. 1·0 (25th, 75th percentiles - 2·8, 6·5) μg/l (P < 0·001). Median soluble transferrin receptor concentrations decreased significantly in the kiwifruit group compared with the banana group, with - 0·5 (25th, 75th percentiles - 0·7, - 0·1) v. 0·0 (25th, 75th percentiles - 0·3, 0·4) mg/l (P = 0·001). Consumption of an Fe-fortified breakfast cereal with kiwifruit compared with banana improved Fe status. Addition of an ascorbic acid-, lutein- and zeaxanthin-rich fruit to a breakfast cereal fortified with ferrous sulfate is a feasible approach to improve Fe status in women with low Fe stores."
2015,25824409,Gambogic acid sensitizes resistant breast cancer cells to doxorubicin through inhibiting P-glycoprotein and suppressing survivin expression.,"The development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remains a major challenge to breast cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of drug efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and resistance to apoptosis are the two key factors that confer cancer drug resistance. Gambogic acid (GA), a major component of Gamboge resin, has potent anticancer effects and can inhibit the growth of several types of human cancers. However, the potential and underlying mechanisms of GA in reversing cancer resistance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that GA can markedly sensitize doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant breast cancer cells to DOX-mediated cell death. GA increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX by inhibiting both P-gp expression and activity. Meanwhile, the combination effect was associated with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the suppression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin. Scavenging intracellular ROS or overexpression of survivin blocked the sensitizing effects of GA in DOX-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK was revealed in GA-mediated suppression of survivin expression. This study gives rise to the possibility of applying GA as an anticancer agent for the purpose of combating DOX-resistant breast cancer. "
1992,1510350,Soybean protein-dependent changes in triacylglycerol synthesis and concentration of diacylglycerol in the liver microsomes of fasted-refed rats.,"Effects of soybean protein, casein and whole egg protein on various indices for lipid biosynthesis in the liver were compared in fasted-refed rats. Soybean protein compared to casein and whole egg protein significantly reduced activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthetase. The protein source also slightly reduced the activity of the malic enzyme. Soybean protein compared to other proteins not only reduced the microsomal triacylglycerol but also phosphatidylcholine syntheses when the activities were measured with endogenous diacylglycerol substrate. The protein-dependent changes disappeared, if artificial dispersion of dioleoylglycerol was employed as a substrate. The concentrations of microsomal diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in whole liver in rats fed soybean protein were lower than those fed other proteins. When the diets containing soybean protein and casein were supplemented with DL-methionine (0.5 and 0.3%, respectively) to meet the nutritional requirement of the animals, soybean protein-dependent reductions in these indices for lipid biosynthesis were still detectable but considerably attenuated. Thus, it is plausible that a soybean protein-dependent decrease in fatty acid synthesis reduced the availability of microsomal diacylglycerol substrate for triacylglycerol synthesis and in turn modified hepatic triacylglycerol concentration. The dietary availability of sulfur amino acids may, at least in part, be responsible for the consequence observed in the present study."
2014,25799861,Tobacco - a producer of recombinant interferons.,"The approved therapeutic interferons, which are chiefly indicated for a treatment of hepatitis C or hairy cell leukaemia (IFN-α), relapsingl remitting sclerosis multiplex (IFN-β) and chronic granulomatous disease (IFN-γ), are commercially produced by recombinant DNA technology, mainly in bacteria Escherichia coli (IFN-α, IFN-β1b, IFN-γ), rarely in a mammalian cell line CHO (IFN-βla). A serum half-life time of some non-glycosylated IFN-α products was extended by a chemical attachment of a branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) to give PEGylated IFN-α. The therapy with recombinant interferons proves expensive and hence much hope is concerned with their production in other platforms assumed to be cheaper, like transgenic plants. Currently, tobacco, botanically species Nicotiana tabacum, its cultivars and some related species, especially N. benthamiana, is one of the most important plant expression systems tested for the production of therapeutical polypeptides and proteins (so-called biopharmaceuticals or biologics), especially vaccines, by using either greenhouse or field cultivated plants or cell suspension culture. IFN-α subtypes were expressed in tobacco nuclear genom e (IFN-α2a and 2b), chloroplast genome (IFN-α2b) and by transient expression (IFN-α2b). The IFα-a2b chimera fusions with O-glycosylated protein with O-a-rabinogalactans expressed in tobacco BY-2 cell culture showed increased half-life time similar to that obtained by PEGylation. The production of IFN-α2b (non-glycosydated) in tobacco glasshouse or field cultivation has been also elaborated. One report concerned expression of IFN-β but with low yield. N-glycosylated IFN-γ could be efficiently expressed in tobacco protoplast infected with recombinant brome mosaic virus (BMV) with the yield of 5-10% of total extracted protein. This type interferon (non-glycosylated), when expressed in chloroplast genome, proved unstable and could be obtained with reasonable yield as a fusion with GUS (β-glucuronidase)."
2012,22408257,Reduced intensity conditioning is superior to nonmyeloablative conditioning for older chronic myelogenous leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant during the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)/nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning hematopoietic cell transplants (HCTs) have changed the therapeutic strategy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. We analyzed post-HCT outcomes of 306 CML patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research aged 40 years and older undergoing RIC/NMA HCT from 2001 to 2007: 117 (38%) aged 40 to 49 years, 119 (39%) 50 to 59 years, and 70 (23%) 60 years or older. The majority (74%) had treatment with imatinib before HCT. At HCT, most patients aged 40 to 49 years were in chronic phase (CP) 1 (74%), compared with 31% aged 60 years or older. Siblings were donors for 56% aged 40 to 49 years; older cohorts had more unrelated donors. The majority received peripheral blood grafts and RIC across all age groups. 3 year overall survival (54%, 52%, and 41%), day + 100 grade II-IV acute GVHD (26%, 32%, and 32%), chronic GVHD (58%, 51%, and 43%), and 1-year treatment-related mortality (18%, 20%, and 13%) were similar across ages. The 3-year relapse incidence (36%, 43%, and 66%) and disease-free survival (35%, 32%, and 16%) were inferior in the oldest cohort. Importantly, for CP1 patients, relapse and disease-free survival were similar across age cohorts. Allogeneic RIC HCT for older patients with CML can control relapse with acceptable toxicity and survival in TKI-exposed CML, especially if still in CP1."
2013,23415177,Freeze-dried jaboticaba peel powder improves insulin sensitivity in high-fat-fed mice.,"The peel of the native Brazilian fruit jaboticaba is rich in anthocyanins, which are known for their anti-obesity effects in animal models. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of freeze-dried jaboticaba peel powder (FDJPP) on a number of metabolic parameters in a model of diet-induced obesity. Mice (n 8 per group) were initially fed on a high-fat diet (HFD, 35% w/w) for 4 weeks and then switched to a HFD supplemented with FDJPP (1, 2 or 4% w/w) for an additional 6 weeks. Energy intake, weight loss, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and lipid profile were determined, and the results were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey’s tests. The FDJPP exerted no protective effect on HFD-induced weight gain, hyperleptinaemia and glucose intolerance. However, the supplementation was effective to reduce insulin resistance, as evidenced in the insulin tolerance test, and subsequently confirmed by improved signal transduction through the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/Akt/forkhead box protein pathway and by the attenuation of HFD-induced inflammation in the liver, verified by lower expressions of IL-1b and IL-6 and decreased phosphorylated IkB-a protein levels in all jaboticaba-treated mice. These results suggest that FDJPP may exert a protective role against obesity-associated insulin resistance."
2014,24194261,In vitro inhibitory effect of piperlonguminine isolated from Piper longum on human cytochrome P450 1A2.,"Piperlonguminine (PL), a major alkaloid isolated from Piper longum fruits, shows several biological activities including anti-tumor, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects. Although there have been studies of the biological effects of PL, the potential drug-interaction effect of PL following evaluation of inhibitory effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities was not investigated. Here, to investigate the inhibitory effects of PL on the activities of CYP isoforms, CYP inhibition assays were conducted using a cocktail of probe substrates in pooled human liver microsome (HLMs) and human recombinant cDNA-expressed CYP. PL strongly inhibited CYP1A2-mediated phenacetin O-deethylation with an IC50 value of 8.8 μM, as NADPH-independent inhibition, while other CYPs were not significantly inhibited. A Lineweaver-Burk plot resulted in the inhibition mechanism of PL being divided into two different modes, reversible competitive inhibition in a low concentration range of 0-16 μM with a Ki value of 1.39 μM and uncompetitive inhibitory behavior at a high concentration range of 16-40 μM. In addition, PL only decreased CYP 1A2-catalyzed phenacetin O-deethylase activity with IC50 values of 10.0 μM in human recombinant cDNA-expressed 1A2, not 1A1. Overall, this is the first investigation of potential herb-drug interactions associated with PL conducted by identifying the competitive inhibitory effects of PL on CYP1A2 in HLMs."
2017,28320088,"Flower extract of Allium atroviolaceum triggered apoptosis, activated caspase-3 and down-regulated antiapoptotic Bcl-2 gene in HeLa cancer cell line.","Cervical cancer accounts for the second most frequent cancer and also third leading cause of cancer mortality (15%) among women worldwide. The major problems of chemotherapeutic treatment in cervical cancer are non-specific cytotoxicity and drug resistance. Plant-derived products, known as natural therapies, have been used for thousands of years in cancer treatment with a very low number of side effects. Allium atroviolaceum is a species in the genus Allium and Liliaceae family, which could prove to have beneficial effects on cancer treatment, although there is a lack of corresponding attention. The methanolic extract from the A.atroviolaceum flower displayed marked anticancer activity on HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells with much lower cytotoxic effects on normal cells (3T3). The A.atroviolaceum extract induced apoptosis, confirmed by cell cycle arrest at the sub-G0 (apoptosis) phase, characteristic morphological changes, evident DNA fragmentation, observed by fluorescent microscope, and early and late apoptosis detection by Annexin V. Furthermore, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-9 and -3 strongly indicated that the mitochondrial pathway was involved in the apoptosis signal pathway. Moreover, combination of A.atroviolaceum extract with doxorubicin revealed a significant reduction of IC50 and led to a synergistic effect. In summary, A.atroviolaceum displayed a significant anti-tumour effect through apoptosis induction in HeLa cells, suggesting that the A.atroviolaceum flower might have therapeutic potential against cervix carcinoma."
2018,30257351,Crocetin attenuates DHT-induced polycystic ovary syndrome in mice via revising kisspeptin neurons.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder of women in reproductive age, is typical with hyperandrogenism and disturbance of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary (HPO) axis, i.e. abnormal expression of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) followed by the elevated ratio of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level. This derangement might have a close relationship with hypothalamic kisspeptin expression that is thought to be a key regulator of GnRH. Crocetin, one of the main components of Saffron clinically used as traditional medicine in gynecology diseases, was evaluated for its therapeutic effects on PCOS induced by prenatally exposure to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in mice. Herein, we found that DHT-treated mice showed a similar phenotype to human PCOS such as heavier ovary, prolonged diestrus, multiple enlarged follicles with fewer corpus luteum, and higher LH and testosterone levels. Kisspeptin expression was lower in anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) but higher in arcuate nucleus (ARC). Treatment of crocetin prevented the prolongation of diestrus and reduction in corpora luteum, recover the levels of GnRH, FSH, LH, progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T), and increase the kisspeptin level in AVPV but reduce that in ARC. The present study provides in vivo evidence that crocetin improved the PCOS in mice via increasing AVPV-kisspeptin and reducing ARC-kisspeptin expression."
2015,25937150,Protective Roles of Selenium on Nitric Oxide and the Gene Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines Induced by Cadmium in Chicken Splenic Lymphocytes.,"Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental toxicant and an inflammation-related xenobiotic. Selenium (Se) is a well-known nutritional trace element and a potent chemopreventive agent. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Se on the cytotoxicity of Cd in bird immunocytes in vitro. Chicken splenic lymphocytes exposed to CdCl2 (10(-6) mol/L), Na2SeO3 (10(-7) mol/L), or a mixture of the two (10(-7) mol/L Na2SeO3 and 10(-6) mol/L CdCI2) were incubated for 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 h. Cd significantly increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and similar results were observed in the protein expression levels of NF-κB and COX-2. In addition, the nitric oxide (NO) content and the inducible iNOS activity were increased in the Cd-treated group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the protective effects of Se against Cd toxicity in chicken splenic lymphocytes were illustrated by the increase in select cytokines (NF-κB, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, and PGE2), NO content and iNOS activity. The biochemical parameters exhibited sensitivity to Se and Cd, suggesting that they may act as potential biomarkers for assessing the effects of Se and Cd risk on chicken splenic lymphocytes. "
2016,26343000,Potential role for GnRH in the synchronization of follicular emergence before the superovulatory Day 0 protocol.,"The ability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to synchronize ovulation and new follicular wave emergence before a ""superovulatory Day 0"" protocol was assessed in Santa Inês ewes. For estrus synchronization, a 60-mg medroxyprogesterone acetate sponge was inserted for 6 d. One day before sponge removal, 37.5-μg d-cloprostenol and 300 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin were injected intramuscularly (i.m.). After sponge removal, ewes were assigned to the following 3 groups: (1) GC-1 mL saline at 12 h (n = 10); (2) G24h-0.025-mg lecirelin (GnRH agonist) i.m. at 24 h (n = 10); or (3) G36h-0.025-mg lecirelin i.m. at 36 h (n = 9). Ovarian ultrasonography was conducted to assess follicular dynamics. Blood was collected to determine plasma concentrations of progesterone and estradiol. Females from G36h and GC had a greater (P < 0.05) estrous response than those from the G24h group (78.0 and 90.0 vs 0.0%, respectively). Ewes from G24h and G36h had earlier (P < 0.05) ovulation (48.0 ± 10.2 and 56.7 ± 5.7 h) compared with those from Gc (64.1 ± 9.7 h). The mean number of ovulations per ewe was greater (P < 0.05) in Gc (1.9 ± 0.6) and G36h (2.0 ± 1.0) than G24h (1.2 ± 0.4). Plasma concentrations of progesterone and estradiol differed over time. Follicular growth during the postovulatory day was affected (P < 0.05) by day of the estrus cycle as well as by the interaction (P < 0.05) of treatment and day of the estrus cycle. There was a larger (P < 0.05) population of medium follicles during the first 24 h after the ovulation in G24h compared with Gc, and there was an absence of large follicles in G36h between 36 and 72 h after ovulation. In conclusion, the use of GnRH agonist at 36 h more efficiently synchronized ovulation and promoted the absence of dominant follicles during early diestrus and may be used at the start of superovulatory treatment at 80 h in Santa Inês ewes."

It has been known for its anticancer efficacy and lack of severe toxicities to normal tissues. Structural alterations in noscapine core architecture have produced a number of potent analogues of noscapine. Here, we report an unusual activity of a novel noscapine analogue, 9-(4-vinylphenyl)noscapine (VinPhe-Nos) on cancer cells. As we reported earlier, VinPhe-Nos inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation with an IC50 of 6μM. The present study elucidated a possible antiproliferative mechanism of action of VinPhe-Nos. The noscapinoid significantly inhibited clonogenic propagation of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, unlike the majority of tubulin-binding agents, it did not induce mitotic arrest; instead, it prolonged S-phase. Although prolonged presence of the drug show some disruption of cellular microtubule architecture, it did not affect microtubule recovery after cold-induced depolymerization. VinPhe-Nos, nevertheless, induced acetylation and bundling of microtubules. Our data suggest that rational modification of parent compound can alter its mechanism of action on cell cycle and that VinPhe-Nos can be investigated further as a less-toxic, S-phase-preferred, cytostatic anticancer agent."
2003,14505804,"Suppression of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice by zerumbone, a subtropical ginger sesquiterpene, and nimesulide: separately and in combination.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are inflammatory disorders of unknown cause and difficult to treat, though some synthetic chemicals, including ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), are anticipated to be useful drugs. In contrast, few food phytochemicals have been reported to suppress colitis in animal models. The present study was undertaken to explore the suppressive efficacy of zerumbone (ZER), a sesquiterpenoid present in the rhizome of Zingiber zerumbet Smith that is used as a condiment in Southeast Asian countries and known to be a potent suppressant of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in cell culture systems. Acute colitis was induced by exposing female ICR mice to 5% DSS in drinking water for 1 week. One week prior to DSS administration, the experimental mice were fed ZER alone, nimesulide (NIM, a selective COX-2 inhibitor) alone, or both in combination (1000 ppm each) for a total of 2 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, i.e. interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and PGF(2alpha) in colonic mucosa were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in conjunction with histological alterations. Oral feeding of ZER significantly lowered the levels of IL-1beta [inhibitory rate (IR)=34%], TNF-alpha (IR=29%), and PGE(2) (IR=73%) and suppressed DSS-induced colitis, whereas NIM suppressed the histological changes induced by DSS without affecting inflammatory biomarkers. However, their treatment in combination was most effective for suppressing these biomarkers. Our results suggest that ZER is a novel food factor for mitigating experimental UC and that use of a combination of agents, with different modes of actions, may be an effective anti-inflammatory strategy."
1986,3081926,"Moclobemide, a new reversible MAO inhibitor--interaction with tyramine and tricyclic antidepressants in healthy volunteers and depressive patients.","Moclobemide is a new, short-acting, reversible MAOI, preferentially affecting type A MAO. We have studied the interaction of moclobemide with tyramine and tricyclic antidepressants in healthy volunteers and depressive patients. Neither tyramine capsules (50 mg) nor cheese and wine meals (65 mg tyramine) produced a significant change in blood pressure and heart rate after single or repeated doses of moclobemide in volunteers. In contrast, after 1 weeks' treatment with tranylcypromine pressure response to cheese and wine meals was severe. Blood pressure sensitivity to IV tyramine was slightly increased (1.5-2 fold; P less than 0.05 versus predrug) during moclobemide treatment in patients and volunteers. This increase was neutralised by concomitant administration of desipramine in volunteers. Amitriptyline was well tolerated when given to patients after or together with moclobemide. In conclusion, moclobemide appears relatively safe with respect to tyramine sensitivity and interaction with tricyclics."
2019,31400238,Black tea extract and theaflavin derivatives affect the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin by modulating organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 activity.,"Theaflavins (TFs) are derived from black tea, an important source of dietary polyphenols. Although the potential interactions between dietary polyphenols and drugs have been demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo studies, little information is available concerning the influence of TFs on drug disposition. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) is expressed in human enterocytes and plays a role in the intestinal absorption of numerous drugs. The current study evaluated the effects of black tea extracts on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in rats, and investigated the effect of four major TFs (theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate) on the transport activity of OATP2B1. Black tea extracts significantly decreased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0 -8 ) of rosuvastatin by 48% and 37%, respectively (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, OATP2B1-mediated rosuvastatin and estrone-3-sulfate uptake was significantly reduced in the presence of TFs. A kinetic study revealed that the uptake efficiency (in terms of Vmax /Km ) of rosuvastatin was decreased following treatment with TFs. Black tea extracts also reduced OATP2B1-mediated rosuvastatin uptake. These results suggest that black tea reduces the plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin by inhibiting the intestinal OATP2B1-mediated transport of rosuvastatin."
2005,16286814,"Kappa-opioid receptor-mediated effects of the plant-derived hallucinogen, salvinorin A, on inverted screen performance in the mouse.","Salvinorin A is a pharmacologically active diterpene that occurs naturally in the Mexican mint Ska Maria Pastora (Salvia divinorum) and represents the first naturally occurring kappa-opioid receptor agonist. The chemical structure of salvinorin A is novel among the opioids, and thus defines a new structural class of kappa-opioid-receptor selective drugs. Few studies have examined the effects of salvinorin A in vivo, and fewer still have attempted to assess the agonist actions of this compound at mu-opioid, delta-opioid, and kappa-opioid receptors using selective antagonists. In the mouse, salvinorin A disrupted climbing behavior on an inverted screen task, indicating a rapid, but short-lived induction of sedation/motor incoordination. Similar effects were observed with the mu-agonist remifentanil and the synthetic kappa-agonist U69,593. When behaviorally equivalent doses of all three opioids were challenged with antagonists at doses selective for mu-opioid, delta-opioid, or kappa-opioid receptors, results suggested that the motoric effects of remifentanil were mediated by mu-receptors, whereas those of salvinorin A and U69,593 were mediated via kappa-receptors. Despite similar potencies and degrees of effectiveness, salvinorin A and U69,593 differed with regard to their susceptibility to antagonism by the kappa-antagonist nor-binaltorphamine. This later finding, coupled with the novel chemical structure of the compound, is consistent with recent findings that the diterpene salvinorin A may bind to the kappa-receptor in a manner that is qualitatively different from that of more traditional kappa-agonists such as the benzeneacetamide U69,593. Such pharmacological differences among these kappa-opioids raise the possibility that the development of other diterpene-based opioids may yield important therapeutic compounds."
2007,17214607,"The induction of CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by six trade herbal products in cultured primary human hepatocytes.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro inductive potential of six commonly used trade herbal products on CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolic activities. Herbal components were extracted from the trade products in a way that ensured a composition equal to that present in the original product. Primary human hepatocytes and specific CYP substrates were used. Classic inducers were used as positive controls and herbal extracts were added in in vivo-relevant concentrations. Metabolites were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). St. John's wort and common valerian were the strongest inducing herbs. In addition to induction of CYP3A4 by St. John's wort, common valerian and Ginkgo biloba increased the activity of CYP3A4 and 2D6 and CYP1A2 and 2D6, respectively. A general inhibitory potential was observed for horse chestnut, Echinacea purpurea and common sage. St. John's wort inhibited CYP3A4 metabolism at the highest applied concentration. Horse chestnut might be a herb with high inhibition potentials in vivo and should be explored further at lower concentrations. We show for the first time that G. biloba may exert opposite and biphasic effects on CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 metabolism. Induction of CYP1A2 and inhibition of CYP2D6 were found at low concentrations; the opposite was observed at high concentrations. CYP2D6 activity, regarded generally as non-inducible, was increased by exposure to common valerian (linear to dose) and G. biloba (highest concentration). An allosteric activation is suggested. From the data obtained, G. biloba, common valerian and St. John's wort are suggested as candidates for clinically significant CYP interactions in vivo."
2009,19386474,Antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori strains and antioxidant properties of blackberry leaves (Rubus ulmifolius) and isolated compounds.,"Rubus spp. (Rosaceae) provide extracts used in traditional medicine as antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and radical scavenging agents. Resistance to antibiotics used to treat Helicobacter pylori infection as well as their poor availability in developing countries prompted us to test the antimicrobial activity of Rubus ulmifolius leaves and isolated polyphenols against two H. pylori strains with different virulence (CagA+ strain 10K and CagA(-) strain G21). The antioxidant activity (TEAC values) of the tested compounds ranged from 4.88 (gallic acid) to 1.60 (kaempferol), whilst the leaf extract gave a value of 0.12. All the isolated polyphenols as well as the leaf extract showed antibacterial activity against both of the H. pylori strains. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the extract for H. pylori strains G21 and 10K, respectively, were 1200 microg/mL and 1500 microg/mL after 24h of exposure and 134 microg/mL and 270 microg/mL after 48 h exposure. Ellagic acid showed very low MBC values towards both of the H. pylori strains after 48 h (2 microg/mL and 10 microg/mL for strains G21 and 10K, respectively) and kaempferol toward G21 strain (MBC=6 microg/mL). A relationship between antimicrobial activity and antioxidant capacity was found only for H. pylori strain G21 CagA(-) strain."
2016,26994770,Different Zinc Sources Have Diverse Impacts on Gene Expression of Zinc Absorption Related Transporters in Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells.,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of zinc sources on gene expression of zinc-related transporters in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-1). IPEC-1 cells were treated with zinc glycine chelate (Zn-Gly), zinc methionine (Zn-Met), and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), respectively, for measurement of cell viability. Then, the relative expression of zinc-related transporters in IPEC-1 in response to different zinc sources (50 μmol/L zinc) was measured. Zinc transporter SLC39A4 (ZIP4) expression was selectively silenced to assess the function of ZIP4 in inorganic and organic zinc absorption. The result showed that Zn-Gly and Zn-Met had lower cell damage compared with ZnSO4 on the same zinc levels. Different zinc sources improved the expression of metallothionein1 (MT1) and zinc transporter SLC30A1 (ZnT1) messenger RNA (mRNA) compared with the control (P < 0.05), while ZIP4 decreased (P < 0.05) in response to zinc addition. MT1 and ZnT1 mRNA expressions in Zn-Gly and Zn-Met were higher than those in ZnSO4, and ZIP4 mRNA expression in Zn-Met was the lowest among three kinds of zinc sources (P < 0.05). Expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA in control was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than added different zinc sources groups. Silencing of ZIP4 significantly decreased MT1 mRNA expression in ZnSO4 and Zn-Gly treatments, reduced zinc absorption rate, and increased DMT1 mRNA expression in ZnSO4 compared with negative control. In summary, different zinc sources could improve zinc status on IPEC-1 cells and organic zinc had lower cell damage compared with ZnSO4. Moreover, Zn-Gly and Zn-Met are more efficient on zinc absorption according to the expression of various zinc-related transporters MT1, ZIP4, ZnT1, and DMT1. ZIP4 played a direct role in inorganic zinc uptake, and the absorption of zinc in Zn-Gly depends on ZIP4 partly, while absorption of Zn-Met is less dependent on ZIP4. "
2019,29648463,"Protective effect of thymoquinone, the main component of Nigella Sativa, against diazinon cardio-toxicity in rats.","Several studies have shown that oxidative stress and cell damage can occur at very early stages of diazinon (DZN) exposure. The present study was designed to determine the beneficial effect of thymoquinone (Thy), the main component of Nigella sativa (black seed or black cumin), against DZN cardio-toxicity in rats. In the present experimental study, 48 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: control (corn oil gavages), DZN gavages (20 mg/kg/day), Thy gavages (10 mg/kg/day) and Thy + DVN gavages (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day). Treatments were continued for 28 days, then the animals were anesthetized by ether and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenize (LDH) and glutathione peroxide (GPX) activity was evaluated. In addition, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) the heart tissue and creatinephosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB) and troponin (TPI) levels and cholinesterase activity in the blood were evaluated. DZN-induced oxidative damage and elevated the levels of the cardiac markers CK-MB, TPI, MDA and LDH and decreased SOD, CAT and cholinesterase activity and GSH level compared with the control group. Treatment with Thy reduced DZN cardio-toxicity and cholinesterase activity. The success of Thy supplementation against DZN toxicity can be attributed to the antioxidant effects of its constituents. Administration of Thy as a natural antioxidant decreased DZN cardio-toxicity and improved cholinesterase activity in rats through the mechanism of free radical scavenging."
2013,23796750,"Malvidin-3-O-β glucoside, major grape anthocyanin, inhibits human macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators and decreases clinical scores in arthritic rats.","Polyphenolic anthocyanins are major colorful compounds in red fruits, known to prevent cardiovascular and other diseases. Grape polyphenols are a mixture of various molecules and their exact contribution to above bioactivities remains to be clarified. In the present study, we first analyzed the effect of purified grape-derived compounds on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) survival, proliferation, as well as for their ability to inhibit the activation of human normal macrophages. Data indicated that malvidin-3-O-β glucoside (Malβg), the major grape anthocyanin, is bioactive with no toxicity on human PBMC. Malβg decreased the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediators, confirmed by the inhibition of TNFα, IL1, IL-6 and iNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) secretion from activated macrophages. As Malβg also inhibited inflammatory response of rat macrophages, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of Malβg in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). Malβg significantly diminished inflammatory cachexia and arthritic paw scores in AIA rats at both therapeutic and preventive levels. In vivo effects of Malβg correlated with down-regulation of NO generation from AIA rats' peritoneal macrophages ex vivo. These data indicate that Malβg, major grape anthocyanin, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo, without detectable toxic effect. "
2005,16414332,"Therapeutic effects of progestins, androgens, and tibolone for menopausal symptoms.","Therapeutic strategies using progestins, androgens, and synthetic steroids such as tibolone are based on the understanding that estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors are localized to reproductive target tissues, brain, and bone. Unfortunately, these sex steroid receptors are widely distributed and localized to other tissues, often resulting in unintended effects. Progestins at high doses have been shown to be effective at reducing hot flashes by approximately 80% to 90%. Side effects include weight gain, mastalgia, fluid retention, vaginal discharge, and dry mouth. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal-derived androgen, can be considered a prohormone that is peripherally converted to more potent androgens and estrogens. In studies with small numbers of subjects, DHEA has been reported to reduce vasomotor symptoms, increase sexual arousal, and improve cognitive performance. With regard to use of other androgens, there are no current testosterone preparations approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in menopausal women. In phase 3 trials, a testosterone transdermal matrix patch has been shown to be effective in treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in menopausal women on estrogen therapy. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestational properties has been shown to be effective in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms and in preserving bone density, and it may provide positive effects on sexual function. The beneficial effects of these compounds in the menopausal woman for treatment of vasomotor symptoms, general well-being, cognitive deficits, bone loss, mood disorders, and sexual function are discussed. The overall clinical trial evidence for benefits and side effects also is presented."
,16148431,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: economic burden and quality of life: literature review.,"The purpose of this review was answer 2 main questions: what is the impact of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on the patient's quality of life and how great is the economic burden of this disease on the health care payers and providers. Patients with CLL typically do not receive any treatment soon after the initial diagnosis. Although there is no known cure for CLL yet, when treated, the patients receive aggressive and expensive therapies (eg, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation). A rigorous and systematic literature review was performed of English-language articles published in 1990-2002. It was supplemented with additional articles published before 1990 for completeness and additional references to fill the gaps identified in the published medical literature. The literature on the quality of life (QOL) of CLL patients is very limited. We identified only 8 articles, and none of them analyzed the QOL in untreated CLL patients. Because CLL is a disease affecting adults, especially the elderly, all 8 studies measured the QOL in the adult population. QOL difficulties include fear of death and disability, problems gaining employment or health insurance, and fatigue. No specific leukemia or CLL instruments but general QOL instruments (eg, I-HRQL) were identified and some cancer-specific ones (eg, EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-G, FACT Anemia, FACT-Fatigue). Interestingly, a FACT-Bone Marrow Transplant instrument exists, although we found no study on CLL that used it. Even the literature on the economic burden of CLL is very limited. We identified 13 studies on the cost of CLL: Most of them were cost-identification or cost-comparison studies, and 5 dealt with the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions to treat CLL. Cost drivers identified for CLL were the chemotherapy costs, intravenous immunoglobulin costs, transplantation costs, and costs associated with the differential staining cytotoxicity assay. We identified very few articles on the QOL of CLL patients and therefore cannot draw strong conclusions about the key QOL predictors. Nevertheless, patients with anemia were found to have a better QOL if they had higher hemoglobin counts and good response to erythropoietin treatment. The articles published seem to demonstrate that the older the age of the patient was, the poorer the QOL. The main cost drivers identified for CLL were related to the treatment chosen (eg, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation). There are hints that higher costs often result from the delivery of non-optimal therapy that leads to adverse events, infections, and drug resistance. In summary, the impact of this disease on the health care budget of the different health care providers and payers as well as on the patient's QOL is substantially unknown, calling for appropriate economic and QOL studies."

Moreover, two novel ABRE-like (abscisic acid response element) elements were identified in the promoter region."
2001,11824435,Choosing an anticoagulant during pregnancy: usually heparin.,"(1) The precise risk of deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy is poorly documented, particularly among women with a history of thromboembolism. (2) Anticoagulant therapy is poorly assessed in pregnant women. (3) Unfractionated heparin remains the reference for use during pregnancy, based on extensive experience and lack of teratogenicity. (4) Low molecular weight heparins have no demonstrated advantage over unfractionated heparin in terms of their risk-benefit ratio, but they do have certain practical advantages. (5) Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin carry a risk of fetal toxicity if taken between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy (nasal and epiphyseal abnormalities). The latency and duration of effects makes them more difficult to use than heparin, especially towards the end of pregnancy. However, they seem to be more effective than heparin in patients with mechanical cardiac valve prostheses."
2015,25880429,Oryeongsan suppressed high glucose-induced mesangial fibrosis.,"The pathological change of kidney in diabetic nephropathy is represented hypertrophy, inflammation, and renal fibrosis. Oryeongsan, traditional oriental herbal formula, is widely used for the treatment of nephrosis, dropsy, and uremia. This study was examined whether Oryeongsan attenuate high-glucose (HG)-promoted rat mesangial cell fibrosis and matrix accumulation, major features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis.Oryeongsan was mixed traditional herbal medicine, Alisma orientale Juz, Polyporus umbellatus Fries, Atractylodes macrocephala Koidez, Poria cocos Wolf and Cinnamomum Cassia Presl (5:3:3:1). Renoprotective role in diabetic nephropathy of Oryeongsan was evaluated by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, Western blot, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy assay.Rat mesangial cell proliferation induced by HG was significantly accelerated, which was inhibited by Oryeongsan in a dose dependent manner. HG enhanced expression of fibrosis biomarkers such as collagen IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was markedly attenuated by Oryeongsan. Oryeongsan increased HG-inhibited membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase expression (MT1-MMP) and MMP-2 promotor activity, whereas suppressed HG-induced tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) expression. Moreover, Oryeongsan promoted extracellular matrix degradation through disturbing transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-Smad signaling. This study further revealed that Oryeongsan ameliorated HG-induced mesangial inflammation accompanying induction of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Moreover, pretreatment of Oryeongsan inhibited NF-κB translocation in HG-exposed mesangial cell.These results demonstrate that Oryeongsan has protective effect against renal proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. Therefore Oryeongsan may be specific therapies targeting renal dysfunction leading to diabetic nephropathy."
2019,31217752,The Effect of Supplementation with Some Essential Oils on the Mobility and the Vitality of Human Sperm.,"The objective of this work is to study the improvement effect of some essential oils of sage (Salvia officinalis), oregano (Origanum vulgare), and eucalyptus (eucalyptus globulus) on the physiological parameters characterizing the quality of human sperm (mobility and vitality). We find natural biomolecules to improve sperm quality to increase the chances of success of very low in vitro fertilization (IVF) that stagnate around 20%. Sperm samples were mixed with different concentrations of essential oils. The effect of these essential oils on the motility and vitality of spermatozoa has been analyzed. The mobility was determined using a Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). In the other side, the evaluation of sperm vitality was performed by staining eosin 2% and the microscopic examination is carried out via optical microscope. A drop of sperm will be mixed with a drop of eosin solution 2%, spread between the slip and coverslip, then allowed to air dry, and examined under a microscope. A significant improvement in the mobility and vitality of human spermatozoa has been noted with oregano. Eucalyptus after 10 min of exposure also significantly improves the mobility and vitality of the spermatozoa. Sage does not improve mobility for these incubation times but significantly improves vitality."
2003,12753889,Cases from the Osler medical service at Johns Hopkins University.,"A 56-year-old black woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted for hypoglycemia and confusion. Her past medical history included breast cancer, for which she had undergone a left lumpectomy and then mastectomy for in-breast recurrence. Her oral intake had decreased during the past month because of increasing discomfort from left-sided chest pain. During this period, she continued to take pioglitazone for diabetes at her originally prescribed dose. The patient's mental status improved quickly after taking orange juice and intravenous glucose, but the chest pain persisted. The pain, which was described as an ache along the left costal margin, increased with palpation, deep inspiration, or coughing. She had recently presented with similar complaints at another hospital where she had been prescribed a muscle relaxant that provided no relief from the pain. She also reported a 14-lb weight loss during the previous 3 months, as well as fatigue, weakness, and aches in her legs and arms. She denied fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, nausea, or recent trauma. Laboratory values at the time of admission were: calcium, 11.8 mg/dL; total protein, 11.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.2 g/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and hematocrit, 29.3%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 89.3. Chest radiography revealed a lytic lesion in the left lateral fourth rib and left humerus (). Serum and urine protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal spike in the gamma region consistent with monoclonal gammopathy. The serum spike was quantified at 3.78 g/dL. A skeletal survey showed many small well-defined lytic lesions in the skull (with one 1.5-cm lytic lesion in the upper posterior parietal bone), arms, and legs. A bone scan showed multiple foci of increased uptake in the right and left ribs as well as the proximal portion of the left femur. The peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation () and plasma cells (). What is the diagnosis?"
2014,24001816,Determinatıon of bisphenol a migrating from canned food and beverages in markets.,"The determination of bisphenol A (BPA) in foods and beverages sold in Turkish markets was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography. In this research, foods packed in packages with an inner surface covered with plastic film, such as milk, fruit juice, cream, pudding and tuna samples were used. Furthermore, foods in glass jar and metal cans such as green peas, garniture, corn, tomato paste, pepper paste, pickles, mushroom and bean samples were also used. BPA concentrations were 21.86±0.80-1858.71±8.24μg kg(-1) for canned foodstuffs, 36.48±0.95-554.69±3.18μgkg(-1) for foods in paper box, ""not detected"" - 399.21±3.26μgkg(-1)for foods in glass jar. The change in the amount of bisphenol A in all of these food, based on expiration date, the amount of glucose and sodium chloride in it has been determined. We see that in these kind of food the amount of bisphenol A increases with an increase in the amount of glucose, NaCl and expiration date. "
2016,26849937,Neuroprotective effect of berberine is mediated by MAPK signaling pathway in experimental diabetic neuropathy in rats.,"The mechanisms leading to diabetic neuropathy are complex. As an active component in several traditional Chinese medicines, berberine has a beneficial effect in the treatment of diabetes with hyperlipidemia. This study evaluated the protective effects of berberine on diabetic neuropathy induced by streptozotocin and a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet in rats. Diabetic neuropathy was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin and a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. Two weeks after diabetes induction, rats were treated with berberine (100 mg/kg) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg) for 24 weeks. Rats were studied using evoked potentials, the Morris water maze, transmission electron microscopy, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, body weight, evoked potentials, and memory were altered in diabetic rats, as was the hippocampal expression of neuritin mRNA, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mRNA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA, extracellular signal-regulated kinase mRNA and the phospho-proteins of p38, JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In diabetic rats, berberine decreased body weight and the blood levels of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, improved memory and affected evoked potential by decreasing latency. Berberine decreased the mRNA expression of neuritin, p38, and JNK and the protein expression of neuritin, p-p38, and p-JNK. Slight micropathological changes were observed in the hippocampus of berberine-treated diabetic rats. These findings suggest that berberine has a beneficial effect against diabetic neuropathy by improving micropathology and increasing neuritin expression via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway."
2014,25515049,"Lavender oil suppresses indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity in human PBMC.","Lavender remedies have been used in traditional medicine because of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and mood alleviating effects, but underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. Recently, studies investigating the effects of lavender oil in the context of psychiatric disorders have indicated potent pharmacological properties. Metabolism of tryptophan by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was found to provide a biochemical link between immunology and neuroendocrinology and to be a frequent target of natural products.In this in vitro study, interferences of lavender oil and constituents (-)-linalool, (+)-α-pinene and (+)-limonene with tryptophan catabolism by IDO and formation of neopterin via guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-cyclohydrolase-I and of interferon-γ have been investigated using unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).Treatment with lavender oil dose-dependently suppressed PHA-induced tryptophan breakdown and kynurenine formation. Similar effects were observed for the three constituents. In parallel, formation of neopterin and interferon-γ was diminished upon lavender oil treatment. In unstimulated PBMC, effect of lavender oil treatment was similar, but less pronounced.Data from this in vitro study suggest that lavender oil treatment might contribute to the modulation of the immune and neuroendocrine system by interfering with activation-induced tryptophan breakdown and IDO activity."
2015,26197981,Estimation of habitual iodine intake in Japanese adults using 16 d diet records over four seasons with a newly developed food composition database for iodine.,"Although habitual seaweed consumption in Japan would suggest that iodine intake in Japanese is exceptionally high, intake data from diet records are limited. In the present study, we developed a composition database of iodine and estimated the habitual intake of iodine among Japanese adults. Missing values for iodine content in the existing composition table were imputed based on established criteria. 16 d diet records (4 d over four seasons) from adults (120 women aged 30-69 years and 120 men aged 30-76 years) living in Japan were collected, and iodine intake was estimated. Habitual intake was estimated with the Best-power method. Totally, 995 food items were imputed. The distribution of iodine intake in 24 h was highly skewed, and approximately 55 % of 24 h values were < 300 μg/d. The median iodine intake in 24 h was 229 μg/d for women and 273 μg/d for men. All subjects consumed iodine-rich foods (kelp or soup stock) on one or more days of the sixteen survey days. The mean (median) habitual iodine intake was 1414 (857) μg/d for women and 1572 (1031) μg/d for men. Older participants had higher intake than younger participants. The major contributors to iodine intake were kelp (60 %) and soup stock (30 %). Habitual iodine intake among Japanese was sufficient or higher than the tolerable upper intake level, particularly in older generations. The association between high iodine intake as that observed in the present study and thyroid disease requires further study."
2011,22139684,Evaluation of metabolism-mediated herb-drug interactions.,"As the use of herbal medicines increases, the public health consequences of drug-herb interactions are becoming more significant. Herbal medicines share the same drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and P-glycoprotein, with several clinically important drugs. Interactions of several commonly used herbal medicines, such as Ginko biloba, milk thistle, and St. John's wort, with therapeutic drugs including warfarin, midazolam, alprazolam, indinavir, saquinavir, digoxin, nifedipine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, irinotecan, and imatinib in humans have been reported. Many of these drugs have very narrow therapeutic indices. As the herb-drug interactions can significantly alter pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs, the drugs interacting with herbal medicines should be identified by appropriate in vitro and in vivo methods. A good understanding of the mechanisms of herb-drug interactions is also essential for assessing and minimizing clinical risks. In vitro methods are useful for providing mechanistic information and evaluating multiple components in herbal medicines. This review describes major factors affecting the metabolism of herbal medicines, mechanisms of herb-drug interactions mediated by CYPs and UGTs, and several in vitro methods to assess the herb-drug interactions. Finally, drug interactions of Ginkgo biloba and St. John's wort, as representative herbal medicines, are described."
2012,22234368,Dehydroepiandrosterone reduces preadipocyte proliferation via androgen receptor.,"Several studies have suggested that both testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) have weight-reducing and antidiabetic effects, especially in rodent studies; however, the precise mechanism of their action remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of DHEA on cell growth in adipose tissue. The appearance of senescence-associated β-galactosidase in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats, an animal model of inherent obese type 2 diabetes, was prevented by DHEA administration. Next, the effects of DHEA and testosterone were compared in vivo and in vitro to evaluate whether these hormones influence cell growth in adipose tissue. Both DHEA and testosterone reduced body weight and epididymal fat weight equivalently when administered for 4 wk. To assess the effect of DHEA and testosterone on cell growth in adipose tissue, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake by SVF was measured. Quantification analysis of BrdU uptake by examining DNA isolated from each SVF revealed that treatment with DHEA and testosterone reduced cell replication. These results indicated that DHEA- and testosterone-induced decreased adiposity was associated with reduced SVF growth. Incubation with DHEA and testosterone equally decreased BrdU uptake by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Pretreatment with the androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor flutamide, but not the estrogen receptor inhibitor fulvestrant, abolished these effects. Knockdown of AR with siRNA also inhibited DHEA-induced decreases in BrdU uptake. These results suggest that DHEA-induced growth suppression of preadipocytes is mediated via AR. Therefore, both DHEA and testosterone similarly decrease adipocyte growth possibly via a common mechanism."
1995,7761621,"Degradation of endothelin-1 by extracts of rat lung, kidney, and liver.","Degradation of 125I-labeled endothelin-1 (125I-ET-1) when incubated 120 min at 37 degrees C with rat lung, kidney and liver plasma membrane extracts was examined using HPLC. Lung and kidney extracts showed degrading enzyme activity, but none was found in liver extract. EDTA almost abolished degradation of 125I-ET-1 in lung and kidney extracts. Phosphoramidon and SCH 39370, both inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), markedly inhibited degradation of 125I-ET-I in lung extract and clearly less in kidney extract. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and elastase inhibitor partly inhibited degradation in lungs and in kidney extract. Leupeptin had no inhibitory effect neither in lung nor in kidney extract. Our results suggest: (1) at least two types of enzymes degrade ET-1 in lung and kidney extracts, namely metallo-proteinases and serine proteinases. (2) The ET-1 degrading effect appears to be different in lungs and kidneys, metallo-proteinases being more important in pulmonary than in renal degradation of ET-1."
2014,24444925,Topsoil drying combined with increased sulfur supply leads to enhanced aliphatic glucosinolates in Brassica juncea leaves and roots.,"The decrease of water availability is leading to an urgent demand to reduce the plants' water supply. This study evaluates the effect of topsoil drying, combined with varying sulfur (S) supply on glucosinolates in Brassica juncea in order to reveal whether a partial root drying may already lead to a drought-induced glucosinolate increase promoted by an enhanced S supply. Without decreasing biomass, topsoil drying initiated an increase in aliphatic glucosinolates in leaves and in topsoil dried roots supported by increased S supply. Simultaneously, abscisic acid was determined, particularly in dehydrated roots, associated with an increased abscisic acid concentration in leaves under topsoil drying. This indicates that the dehydrated roots were the direct interface for the plants' stress response and that the drought-induced accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates is related to abscisic acid formation. Indole and aromatic glucosinolates decreased, suggesting that these glucosinolates are less involved in the plants' response to drought. "
2004,15036764,Parenteral sesame oil attenuates oxidative stress after endotoxin intoxication in rats.,"Sesame oil is regarded as a daily nutritional supplement to increase cell resistance to lipid peroxidation. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of parenteral sesame oil on oxidative stress and hepatic disorder induced by lipopolysaccharide and to determine the defense mechanisms involved in sesame oil-associated anti-oxidative effects in rats. Oxidative stress was induced by lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and assessed by determination of lipid peroxidation. Sesame oil (8 ml/kg, subcutaneously) was given 3 h after lipopolysaccharide, and lipid peroxide levels, hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as the levels of glutathione and nitrite were examined 6 h after lipopolysaccharide. Hepatic function was assessed by determining the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Sesame oil reduced lipid peroxidation and hydroxyl radical, but failed to affect superoxide anion. Superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased, but glutathione was not affected, and the levels of nitrite were reduced. Further, sesame oil-treated groups showed attenuated hepatic disorder in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats. Thus, parenteral sesame oil can be used to attenuate oxidative stress and relieve hepatic disorder after lipopolysaccharide intoxication in rats."
2007,18096028,Ginger inhibits cell growth and modulates angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells.,"Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc) is a natural dietary component with antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties. The ginger component [6]-gingerol has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects through mediation of NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB can be constitutively activated in epithelial ovarian cancer cells and may contribute towards increased transcription and translation of angiogenic factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ginger on tumor cell growth and modulation of angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells in vitro.The effect of ginger and the major ginger components on cell growth was determined in a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines. Activation of NF-kappaB and and production of VEGF and IL-8 was determined in the presence or absence of ginger.Ginger treatment of cultured ovarian cancer cells induced profound growth inhibition in all cell lines tested. We found that in vitro, 6-shogaol is the most active of the individual ginger components tested. Ginger treatment resulted in inhibition of NF-kB activation as well as diminished secretion of VEGF and IL-8.Ginger inhibits growth and modulates secretion of angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells. The use of dietary agents such as ginger may have potential in the treatment and prevention of ovarian cancer."
2009,18835260,Protection of acetaminophen induced mitochondrial dysfunctions and hepatic necrosis via Akt-NF-kappaB pathway: role of a novel plant protein.,"Oxidative stress is a major cause of drug induced hepatic diseases. The present study aims to investigate the antioxidative signaling mechanism of a protein isolated from the herb, Cajanus indicus against acetaminophen induced necrotic cell death. We found that incubation of hepatocytes with the protein prevented acetaminophen-induced loss in cell viability, reduction in glutathione level and enhancement of reactive oxygen species generation. Treatment of mice with the protein before administration of acetaminophen also reduced serum nitrite and TNF-alpha formation. Moreover, it counteracted acetaminophen-induced loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, loss in adenosine tri phosphate and rise in intracellular calcium. Investigating the cell signaling pathways, we found that the protein exerts its protective action via the activation of NF-kappaB and Akt and deactivation of STAT-1. Surprisingly, no role of ERK1/2 or STAT-3 was found in the protein-mediated protection of hepatocytes during acetaminophen exposure. Finally, we found that acetaminophen introduces necrosis as the primary phenomena of cell death and protein treatment decreased the necrotic process as evident from the DNA fragmentation and flow-cytometry studies. In addition, administration of the protein to mice before acetaminophen application showed fewer number of TUNEL positive cells. Combining, data suggest that the protein possesses cytoprotective activity against acetaminophen-induced oxidative cellular damage and prevents hepatocytes from necrotic death."
2005,15802843,Spectrophotometric determination of plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activity of 53 fruit farm workers pre- and post-exposed chlorpyrifos for one fruit crop.,"We sought to investigate the early biological effects of chlorpyrifos among 53 Thai fruit farm workers by measuring the plasma cholinesterase (PChE) and red blood cell cholinesterase (AChE) activities, a biomarker of organophosphate (OPs) pesticide during one fruit crop. The ChE activity (V(m)/K(m)) was spectrophotometrically analyzed before and after exposing to chlorpyrifos. The V(m)/K(m) values of both non-spraying and spraying seasons are found as normal distribution pattern. The median PChE and AChE activities among farm workers in the non-spraying season were 2.3 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 7.26 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively. The median PChE and AChE activities of the farm workers in the spraying season were 2.02 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 5.95 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively. The mean V(m)/K(m) values of PChE shifted left (t-test, p=0.013), indicating a decrease in PChE activity in the farm workers exposed to chlorpyrifos. However, the V(m)/K(m) values of AChE in nonspraying season and in the spraying season were not different (t-test, p=0.246). We propose that PChE activity can be used as a biomarker for monitoring early toxicity induced by chlorpyrifos insecticide."
2006,17205991,Acrodermatitis enteropathica: zinc therapy and possible identification of a carrier state through multiple hair zinc analyses over three decades.,"We report on the successful use of repeated hair analyses over three decades to monitor zinc and copper status in two siblings with Acrodermatitis enteropathica who were treated with oral zinc sulfate beginning in 1975. Furthermore, we report for the first time that analysis of zinc in hair over a 30-yr period allows for the identification of individuals who might be heterozygous carriers of this autosomal recessive disease and who, therefore, would be expected to have hair zinc levels intermediate between normal, healthy individuals and those with Acrodermatitis enteropathica. Zinc treatment of the two patients with Acrodermatitis enteropathica resulted in remission of the signs and symptoms of the disease within the first month of therapy. However, any short-term interruption (typically, 7-10 d) in oral zinc resulted in an almost immediate relapse, with the reappearance of the skin lesions. We also document the inverse relationship that exists between zinc and copper through analysis of these metals in the scalp hair from the two patients, thus providing a tool for ensuring adequate copper intake in patients taking relatively high doses of zinc over a long period."
2005,16175132,The utility of the population approach applied to bioequivalence in patients: comparison of 2 formulations of cyclosporine.,"Mixed-effect modeling was used to compare the population pharmacokinetics of 2 formulations of cyclosporine in patients. An open-label, multicenter, conversion study in stable, 6-month post-renal allograft recipients was conducted to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral Pliva Cyclosporine Soft Gelatin Capsules (USP Modified) with Neoral (cyclosporine soft gelatin capsules, USP Modified) in stable post-renal transplant patients. Blood samples were collected predose and for 12 hours postdose on days 1, 14, 15, 28, and 29. Whole-blood samples were analyzed for cyclosporine using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters were generated using noncompartmental and population compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Moreover, the effects of demographic factors on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine were evaluated using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling program NONMEM. The rate and extent of bioavailability of cyclosporine did not differ between Pliva Cyclosporine Soft Gelatin Capsules and Neoral. In the final model, gender and actual body weight significantly affected the central and peripheral volumes of distribution. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine was defined robustly in this patient population using population pharmacokinetic approaches. Results indicate that the Pliva Cyclosporine Soft Gelatin Capsules and Neoral are bioequivalent when administered to renal transplant patients. Pliva Cyclosporine Soft Gelatin Capsules can then be substituted for Neoral in stabilized patients without anticipating dose adjustments."
2019,31335187,Effect of Sodium Hypochlorite on Biofilm-Forming Ability of Histamine-Producing Bacteria Isolated from Fish.,"Histamine poisoning occurs when temperature-abused marine fish containing elevated levels of histamine are consumed. Histamine-producing bacteria found in fish can colonize processing surfaces and form biofilms. In this study, the biofilm-forming abilities of histamine-producing bacteria from Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and the effect of hypochlorite treatment on biofilm formation were studied. The isolates of this study produced histamine in the range of 471 to 2,126 ppm. The histidine decarboxylase gene hdc was detected in all isolates producing histamine except in one strain each of Psychrobacter pulmonis and Proteus vulgaris. All isolates tested in this study produced moderate biofilms under control conditions, whereas exposure to 1 and 3 ppm of sodium hypochlorite significantly enhanced biofilm formation. However, exposure to 5 ppm of sodium hypochlorite showed an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by all the isolates except Klebsiella variicola. The results of this study suggest that histamine-producing bacteria can form stable biofilms and that this activity may be enhanced by the application of low levels of sodium hypochlorite, a phenomenon that might influence the persistence of histamine-producing bacteria in fish processing areas."
2015,26046675,Resveratrol Enhances Etoposide-Induced Cytotoxicity through Down-Regulating ERK1/2 and AKT-Mediated X-ray Repair Cross-Complement Group 1 (XRCC1) Protein Expression in Human Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells.,"Etoposide (VP-16), a topoisomerase II inhibitor, is an effective anti-cancer drug used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound that has been proved to have anti-cancer activity. XRCC1 is an important scaffold protein involved in base excision repair that is regulated by ERK1/2 and AKT signals and plays an important role in the development of lung cancer. However, the role of ERK1/2 and AKT-mediated XRCC1 expression in etoposide treatment alone or combined with resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells has not been identified. In this study, etoposide treatment increased XRCC1 mRNA and protein expression through AKT and ERK1/2 activation in two NSCLC cells, H1703 and H1975. Knockdown of XRCC1 in NSCLC cells by transfection of XRCC1 siRNA or inactivation of ERK1/2 and AKT resulted in enhancing cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition induced by etoposide. Resveratrol inhibited the expression of XRCC1 and enhanced the etoposide-induced cell death and anti-proliferation effect in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, transfection with constitutive active MKK1 or AKT vectors could rescue the XRCC1 protein level and also the cell survival suppressed by co-treatment with etoposide and resveratrol. These findings suggested that down-regulation of XRCC1 expression by resveratrol can enhance the chemosensitivity of etoposide in NSCLC cells. "
2011,21736795,Diet × genotype interactions in hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in response to replacement of dietary fish oil with vegetable oil.,"The present study investigates the effects of genotype on responses to alternative feeds in Atlantic salmon. Microarray analysis of the liver transcriptome of two family groups, lean or fat, fed a diet containing either a fish oil (FO) or a vegetable oil (VO) blend indicated that pathways of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism might be differentially affected by the diet depending on the genetic background of the fish, and this was further investigated by real-time quantitative PCR, plasma and lipoprotein biochemical analysis. Results indicate a reduction in VLDL and LDL levels, with no changes in HDL, when FO is replaced by VO in the lean family group, whereas in fat fish fed FO, levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins were low and comparable with those fed VO in both family groups. Significantly lower levels of plasma TAG and LDL-TAG were measured in the fat group that was independent of diet, whereas plasma cholesterol was significantly higher in fish fed the FO diet in both groups. Hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, β-oxidation and lipoprotein metabolism showed relatively subtle changes. A significantly lower expression of genes considered anti-atherogenic in mammals (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, apoAI, scavenger receptor class B type 1, lipoprotein lipase (LPL)b (TC67836) and LPLc (TC84899)) was found in lean fish, compared with fat fish, when fed VO. Furthermore, the lean family group appeared to show a greater response to diet composition in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, mediated by sterol-responsive element-binding protein 2. Finally, the presence of three different transcripts for LPL, with differential patterns of nutritional regulation, was demonstrated."
2003,12732453,"The effects of coffee on enzymes involved in metabolism of the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in rats.","The effects of coffee on the metabolism and genotoxicity of the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) were investigated. Coffee diminished the bacterial mutagenicity of PhIP in the Ames reversion assay through inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), a key enzyme involved in the metabolic activation of PhIP. When given as part of the diet (0, 1 or 5% w/w) to male Fischer-344 rats for 2 weeks, coffee affected the expression of hepatic enzymes involved in PhIP metabolism. Coffee increased the expression of CYP1A2 by 16-fold in the 5% coffee-treated group, and approximately half of this inductive effect was attributed to caffeine. Coffee also increased the expression of enzymes involved in the detoxication of PhIP. A 2-fold increase in expression of glutathione S-transferase alpha was observed, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGTs) activities of p-nitrophenol increased 2-fold, while N(2)-and N3-glucuronidation of the genotoxic metabolite 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (HONH-PhIP) increased by 1.3-fold in the 5% coffee-treated over the control group. The amount of PhIP (0.75 mg/kg, 24 h) eliminated in urine as the N(2)-and N3-glucuronide conjugates of HONH-PhIP increased by 1.8- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in the 5% coffee-treated group over control rats, suggesting either increased rates of N-oxidation of PhIP or N-glucuronidation of HONH-PhIP. Despite the strong induction of CYP1A2, there was no increase in PhIP-DNA adduct formation in colon and pancreas while liver adducts decreased by 50% over control animals. These data suggest that the effect of coffee on inhibition of PhIP N-oxidation and ensuing DNA damage is more important in vivo than its effect on induction of PhIP N-hydroxylation."
2013,24145508,Ischaemia-reperfusion injury in central retinal artery occlusion.,"A 53-year-old man presented with sudden painless diminution of vision in his right eye for 3 days. His fundus examination showed diffuse whitening of the retina with a cherry red spot at the fovea with cilioretinal artery sparing. On fluorescein angiography delayed arteriovenous transit was observed. Three-dimensional spectral domain optical coherence tomography was used to assess retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and average macular central subfield thickness on days 3, 7, 30 and 90. Marked retinal oedema due to ischaemia was observed on day 3 of occurrence of central retinal artery occlusion. On day 7, significant decrease in retinal nerve fibre thickness and macular thickness was noted suggestive of acute reperfusion injury. Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and macular thickness returned to near normal on day 30 due to restoration of blood supply with wash out of stress mediators. Retinal atrophy was observed on day 90. "
2020,31524111,Effect of flaxseed oil on muscle protein loss and carbohydrate oxidation impairment in a pig model after lipopolysaccharide challenge.,"Flaxseed oil is rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), which is the metabolic precursor of EPA and DHA. The present study investigated the effect of flaxseed oil supplementation on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced muscle atrophy and carbohydrate oxidation impairment in a piglet model. Twenty-four weaned pigs were used in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment including dietary treatment (5 % maize oil v. 5 % flaxseed oil) and LPS challenge (saline v. LPS). On day 21 of treatment, the pigs were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg/kg body weight LPS or sterile saline. At 4 h after injection, blood, gastrocnemius muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle were collected. Flaxseed oil supplementation increased ALA, EPA, total n-3 PUFA contents, protein:DNA ratio and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex quantity in muscles (P < 0·05). In addition, flaxseed oil reduced mRNA expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain protein (NOD) 2 and their downstream signalling molecules in muscles and decreased plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, and mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 (P < 0·05). Moreover, flaxseed oil inclusion increased the ratios of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) 1:total Akt1 and phosphorylated Forkhead box O (FOXO) 1:total FOXO1 and reduced mRNA expression of FOXO1, muscle RING finger (MuRF) 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 in muscles (P < 0·05). These results suggest that flaxseed oil might have a positive effect on alleviating muscle protein loss and carbohydrates oxidation impairment induced by LPS challenge through regulation of the TLR4/NOD and Akt/FOXO signalling pathways."
2014,24721324,Piroxicam and c-phycocyanin prevent colon carcinogenesis by inhibition of membrane fluidity and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling while up-regulating ligand dependent transcription factor PPARγ.,"The colon cancer tissues from DMH treated rats exhibited higher membrane potential, fluidity and changed lipid order as examined by Merocyanine 540 and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, respectively. A transition from gel to liquid crystalline state was observed by Laurdan fluorescence and also reduced fluorescence quenching of NBD-PE as contributed in the decreased membrane lipid phase separation. With piroxicam, a traditional NSAID and c-phycocyanin, a biliprotein from Spirulina platensis, these effects were normalized. An augmented intracellular Ca(+2) had contributed to the drug mediated apoptosis which is supported by an elevated calpain-9 expression. Histopathologically, a large pool of secreted acid/neutral mucopolysaccrides as well as the presence of blood vessels and dysplastic crypts signifies invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma while both the drugs reduced these neoplastic alterations. Wnt/β-catenin pathway was also found to be up-regulated which served as a crucial indicator for cancer cell growth. A concomitant down regulation of PPARγ was noted in DMH treatment which is associated with tumor progression. The expression of PPARα and δ, the other two isoforms of PPAR family was also modulated. We conclude that piroxicam and c-phycocyanin exert their anti-neoplastic effects via regulating membrane properties, raising calpain-9 and PPARγ expression while suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in experimental colon carcinogenesis.

2012,23212641,Neuroprotective effect of edible brown alga Eisenia bicyclis on amyloid beta peptide-induced toxicity in PC12 cells.,"Amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) oligomers increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium cation (Ca(2+)) concentrations, which causes neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the use of neuroprotective agents with antioxidative activity might be effective in the treatment of AD. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of the methanol extract from edible brown alga Eisenia bicyclis (Laminariaceae) and its solvent soluble fractions together with the isolated phlorotannins on Aβ-induced toxicity were assessed by cell viability, intracellular ROS, and Ca(2+) levels in PC12 cells. The addition of the methanol extract as well as its ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of E. bicyclis markedly reversed the Aβ-induced toxicity. Among six phlorotannins, including phloroglucinol (1), dioxinodehydroeckol (2), eckol (3), phlorofucofuroeckol A (4), dieckol (5), and 7-phloroeckol (6), isolated from the most active ethyl acetate fraction, 3-6 significantly decreased Aβ-induced cell death. Furthermore, these compounds also inhibited intracellular ROS generation and Ca(2+) generation, indicating the neuroprotective effects may be mediated through reduced intracellular ROS and Ca(2+) generation. Thus, the results of the present study imply that E. bicyclis and its active components attenuated the oxidative stress and reduced neuronal cell death, suggesting that it may be used as a dietary neuroprotective agent in AD."
2014,25450675,Identification of CYP3A7 for glyburide metabolism in human fetal livers.,"Glyburide is commonly prescribed for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus; however, fetal exposure to glyburide is not well understood and may have short- and long-term consequences for the health of the child. Glyburide can cross the placenta; fetal concentrations at term are nearly comparable to maternal levels. Whether or not glyburide is metabolized in the fetus and by what mechanisms has yet to be determined. In this study, we determined the kinetic parameters for glyburide depletion by CYP3A isoenzymes; characterized glyburide metabolism by human fetal liver tissues collected during the first or early second trimester of pregnancy; and identified the major enzyme responsible for glyburide metabolism in human fetal livers. CYP3A4 had the highest metabolic capacity towards glyburide, followed by CYP3A7 and CYP3A5 (Clint,u=37.1, 13.0, and 8.7ml/min/nmol P450, respectively). M5 was the predominant metabolite generated by CYP3A7 and human fetal liver microsomes (HFLMs) with approximately 96% relative abundance. M5 was also the dominant metabolite generated by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and adult liver microsomes; however, M1-M4 were also present, with up to 15% relative abundance. CYP3A7 protein levels in HFLMs were highly correlated with glyburide Clint, 16α-OH DHEA formation, and 4'-OH midazolam formation. Likewise, glyburide Clint was highly correlated with 16α-OH DHEA formation. Fetal demographics as well as CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 genotype did not alter CYP3A7 protein levels or glyburide Clint. These results indicate that human fetal livers metabolize glyburide predominantly to M5 and that CYP3A7 is the major enzyme responsible for glyburide metabolism in human fetal livers. "
2014,24123260,Effect of gold nanoparticles and ciprofloxacin on microbial catabolism: a community-based approach.,"The effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and ciprofloxacin on the catabolism of microbial communities was assessed. This was accomplished through an ex situ methodology designed to give a priori knowledge on the potential for nanoparticles, or other emerging contaminants, to affect the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities in the environment. Microbial communities from a variety of sources were incubated with 31 prespecified carbon sources and either National Institute of Standards and Technology reference material 10-nm AuNPs or ciprofloxacin on 96-well microtiter plates. From the ciprofloxacin study, dose-response curves were generated and exemplified how this method can be used to assess the effect of a toxicant on overall catabolic capabilities of microbial communities. With 10-nm AuNPs at concentrations ranging from 0.01 µg/mL to 0.5 µg/mL, rhizosphere communities from Typha roots were only slightly catabolically inhibited at a single concentration (0.05 µg/mL); no effects were seen on wetland water communities, and a minor positive (i.e., enhanced catabolic capabilities) effect was observed for loamy soil communities. This positive effect might have been because of a thin layer of citrate found on these AuNPs that initiated cometabolism with some of the carbon sources studied. Under the conditions considered, the possible adverse effects of AuNPs on the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities appears to be minimal."
2016,27894302,Anti-inflammatory and burn injury wound healing properties of the shell of Haliotis diversicolor.,"The shell of Haliotis diversicolor, or shijueming (SJM), is a type of traditional Chinese medicine. The SJM has appeared in historical records as early as the third and fourth centuries. Historical records have revealed that SJM had mainly been used to treat eye diseases. After the Qing Dynasty (1757), records had emerged, detailing the use of SJM for treating skin injuries, particularly for treating poorly managed ulcers or traumatic wounds. Furthermore, in our anti-inflammation-screening system, SJM significantly inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins. Previous studies have yet to adopt an animal model to verify the phenomenon and described in the historical records regarding the efficacy of SJM in promoting wound healing. Besides, the mechanism of wound healing effect of SJM is also not clear.This study applied in vitro and in vivo models, tissue section analysis, and western blotting to evaluate the effect of SJM on wound healing. The RAW 264.7 cells were used in anti-inflammatory activity assay and phagocytic assay. Male Wistar rats were used to evaluate the effect of SJM on burn injury healing. A copper block (2 × 2 cm, 150 g) preheated to 165 °C in a dry bath was used to contact the skin area for 10 s, thus creating a full-thickness burn injury. The results were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, picrosirius red staining and Western blotting.The results revealed that in the in vitro model, the presence of SJM decreased the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and enhanced the functions of macrophages. The results of the rat burn injury model revealed that SJM decreased neutrophil infiltration, promoted wound healing, thus increasing the collagen I content and promoting the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) protein. We speculate that the effect and mechanism of SJM on promoting wound healing is related to macrophage activation. In the inflammation phase, SJM alleviates inflammation by inhibiting iNOS expression and removing neutrophils through phagocytosis. Furthermore, SJM induces the secretion of TGF-β1, converting collagen during the tissue remodeling phase.According to our review of relevant literature, this is the first study that applied an evidence-based method to verify that SJM alleviates inflammation, enhances phagocytosis, and triggers wound healing after burn injury. The study findings reveal that SJM provides a promising therapeutic option for treating burn injury."
2017,28774334,Inhibitory effects of Ponciri Fructus on testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is non-cancerous condition of enlargement of the prostate, a common occurrence in older men. The immature fruits of Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Rafinesque (Rutaceae), Ponciri Fructus are widely used in traditional oriental medicine for the therapy of various diseases. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of BPH. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of a Ponciri Fructus extract (PFE) on the development of BPH in a in a rat model of BPH induced by testosterone propionate (TP).Male Sprague Dawley rats were used as a model of BPH after its induction by daily subcutaneous injections of TP/corn oil, for a period of four weeks. PFE was administrated daily 1 h before TP/corn oil injection by oral gavage at a dose level of 200 mg/kg during the 4 weeks of TP/corn oil injections. All rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, we measured the relative prostate weight, the levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), histological changes, activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase), and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In addition, we also measured the inhibition (%) of 5α-reductase in the prostatic tissue.Our findings indicate that PFE significantly inhibited the development of BPH; decreased the relative prostate weight, the level of testosterone and DHT in serum and prostatic tissue, prostatic hyperplasia, expression of PCNA, and increased the antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, PFE showed a weak inhibitory activity on 5α-reductase.These results suggest that PFE may be used as a therapeutic agent for BPH via antiproliferative and antioxidant effects."
2018,29080462,"Effect of broccoli sprouts on thyroid function, haematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters in rats with thyroid imbalance.","Broccoli sprouts may exert a negative influence on thyroid function as they are a rich source of glucosinolates, in particular glucoraphanin. Under the study in a long-term experiment broccoli sprouts were tested as an element of rats diet, combined with deficient iodine, or sulfadimethoxine ingestion - two models of hypothyroidism. Evaluations were performed for serum TSH and thyroid hormones completed with analyzes of selected haematological, biochemical and immunological (IL-6, IL-10) parameters, as well as cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), thioredoxin reductase (TR) in the thyroid, and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX3). A thermographic analysis was conducted to provide auxiliary indicators for determining a potential thyroid dysfunction under the specific experimental conditions. The levels of TSH, fT3 and fT4 remained unchanged following broccoli sprouts ingestion, which was even found to have a protective effect against sulfadimethoxine induced thyroid damage. Moreover, TR activity significantly increased in response to sprouts ingestion. In animals with hypothyroidism, broccoli sprouts were found to exert a beneficial influence on the antioxidant balance of the thyroid gland. In comparison to the rats with iodine deficiency, broccoli sprouts addition to the diet was observed to decrease IL-6 level. No significant differences in IL-10 concentration were determined. Neither addition of broccoli sprouts to the diet, nor sulfadimethoxine and iodine deficiency, caused negative changes in red blood cell parameters, glucose and uric acid concentrations, or kidney function. However, such a dietary intervention resulted in reduced WBC and PLT levels, and it may adversely interfere with liver function in rats, most likely due to a higher dietary intake of glucosinolates."
2013,23742702,Amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) extract inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced procoagulant and pro-inflammatory factors in cultured vascular endothelial cells.,"Amla (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) has been used for many centuries in traditional Indian Ayurvedic formulations for the prevention and treatment of many inflammatory diseases. The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties of amla fruit extract. The amla fruit extract potentially and significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tissue factor expression and von Willebrand factor release in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (1-100 μg/ml). In a leucocyte adhesion model of inflammation, it also significantly decreased LPS-induced adhesion of human monocytic cells (THP-1) to the HUVEC, as well as reduced the expression of endothelial-leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin) in the target cells. In addition, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a LPS-induced endotoxaemia rat model. Oral administration of the amla fruit extract (50 mg/kg body weight) significantly decreased the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 in serum. These results suggest that amla fruit extract may be an effective anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent."
2019,30579138,Properties of capsaicin and its utility in veterinary and human medicine.,"The main aim of this paper was to show the variety of capsaicin's properties. Capsaicin is an active component of plants of the Capsicum genus, and is known for its pungency. Capsaicin is used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Additional properties of capsaicin have been demonstrated, including pain relief, weight loss, body thermoregulation, and antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Studies of capsaicin's effects on the human and animal organism need to be continued, with special emphasis on new applications."
2016,26582552,Sulphated Polysaccharide Isolated from the Seaweed Gracilaria caudata Exerts an Antidiarrhoeal Effect in Rodents.,"Diarrhoea is a significant health problem for children in developing countries that causes more than 1 million deaths annually. This study aimed to evaluate the antidiarrhoeal effect of sulphated polysaccharide (PLS) from the alga Gracilaria caudata in rodents. For the evaluation, acute diarrhoea was induced in Wistar rats (150-200 g) by administration of castor oil (10 mg/kg). Then, different parameters, including enteropooling and gastrointestinal transit and its pharmacological modulation by opioid and cholinergic pathways, were assessed using activated charcoal in Swiss Mice (25-30 g). Secretory diarrhoea was examined using cholera toxin (CT) (1 mg/loop)-treated, isolated intestinal loops from Swiss mice (25-30 g), which were also used to examine fluid secretion, loss of chloride ions into the intestinal lumen and absorption. In addition, a GM1-dependent ELISA was used to evaluate the interaction between PLS, CT and the GM1 receptor. Pre-treatment with PLS (10, 30 and 90 mg/kg) reduced faecal mass, diarrhoeal faeces and enteropooling. However, 90 mg/kg more effectively reduced these symptoms; therefore, it was used as the standard dose in subsequent experiments. Gastrointestinal transit was also reduced by PLS treatment via a cholinergic mechanism. Regarding the diarrhoea caused by CT, PLS reduced all study parameters, and the ELISA showed that PLS can interact with both the GM1 receptor and CT. These results show that PLS from G. caudata effectively improved the parameters observed in acute and secretory diarrhoea, which affects millions of people, and may lead to the development of a new alternative therapy for this disease.

1995,7857918,Immunological changes in growing mice fed on diets containing casein or peas (Pisum sativum var. Belinda) as the source of protein.,"The effects of two different sources of protein: peas (Pisum sativum var. Belinda) and casein on immunocompetence, nutritional utilization and growth performance have been investigated in recently weaned mice. Feeding these animals on a pea diet resulted in an impairment in growth and significant decreases in the weights of liver, muscle, kidneys and femur, while intestine weights increased. No differences in food consumption were observed, but food conversion efficiency (food intake: weight gain) was increased in pea-fed animals compared with those offered the casein diet. Packed cell volume and serum Fe and Zn levels fell significantly after legume-protein intake, and, by contrast, Cu values increased slightly. Serum albumin levels showed a statistically significant reduction in mice fed on the diet containing peas. However, gamma-globulins and immunoglobulin G titres were markedly increased. The characterization of spleen-cell subsets using monoclonal antibodies revealed a significantly higher percentage of T-lymphocytes in the pea group compared with casein-fed animals, while no changes were observed in the proportions of B-lymphocytes and macrophages. In vitro mitogenic responses to phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide S were slightly, but not significantly, lower in the pea-fed animals. Our results describe, apparently for the first time in mice, some immunological disturbances after peak intake. These results may lead to a better understanding of the possible role of antigenic proteins in gastrointestinal disorders and the poor individual performance after legume intake."
2008,18612042,Effects of oral carbohydrate on autonomic nervous system counterregulatory responses during hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and euglycemia.,"The effects of oral carbohydrate on modulating counterregulatory responses in humans remain undecided. This study's specific aim was to determine the effects of oral carbohydrate on autonomic nervous system (ANS) and neuroendocrine responses during hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and euglycemia. Nineteen healthy volunteers were studied during paired, single blind experiments. Nine subjects underwent two-step glucose clamps consisting of 60 min of euglycemia (5.0 mmol/l) followed by either 15 g of oral carbohydrate (cal) as orange juice or a noncaloric control (nocal) and subsequent 90 min of clamped hypoglycemia (2.9 mmol/l). Ten other subjects underwent two randomized 150-min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with cal or nocal control administered at 60 min. Oral carbohydrate initially blunted (P < 0.05) epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), symptom, and systolic blood pressure responses during hypoglycemia. However, by the end of 90 min of hypoglycemia, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine responses had rebounded and were increased (P < 0.05) compared with control. MSNA and cortisol levels remained suppressed during hypoglycemia (P < 0.05) after cal, whereas pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, symptom, and blood pressure responses increased similar to control following initial suppression. Oral carbohydrate had no effects on neuroendocrine or ANS responses during hyperinsulinemic euglycemia. These results demonstrate that oral carbohydrate can have differential effects on the time course of ANS and neuroendocrine responses during hypoglycemia. We conclude that gastro-splanchnic-portal sensing of an amount of carbohydrate recommended for use in clinical practice for correction of hypoglycemia can have widespread and significant effects on central nervous system mediated counterregulatory responses in healthy humans."
2017,29145844,Development and evaluation of an interferon gamma assay for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in red deer experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis.,"Red deer (Cervus elaphus) is regarded as an epidemiologically relevant host for Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) and closely related members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex that cause animal tuberculosis (TB). The standard antemortem screening test for the detection of TB in deer is the intradermal tuberculin skin test, but the detection of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) produced by white blood cells exposed to M. bovis antigens can be used as an alternative or supplemental assay in most TB eradication/control programs. This study aims to develop an in-house sandwich ELISA for deer IFNγ, based on the cross-reactivity of the antibodies to both cervid and bovine IFNγ, and to evaluate the potential of this assay to detect M. bovis-infected red deer in response to the in vitro stimulation of whole-blood cells with bovine purified protein derivative (bPPD), p22 protein complex derived from bPPD or using the specific tuberculous mycobacterial proteins ESAT-6/CFP-10, Rv3615c and Rv3020c. The positive control stimulant used in this study was pokeweed mitogen, which resulted in a consistent induction of IFNγ in samples from red deer, thus allowing the interpretation of the assay.The percentage of animals correctly classified by this technique as M. bovis non-infected was 100%. The detection of infected animals as positive was high and ranged widely depending upon the antigen and the cut-off value applied, as well as the time after infection. Our findings indicate that this protocol may serve as a reliable assay for the antemortem diagnosis of TB from the initial stage of M. bovis-infection, and may also be adequately sensitive.The suggested optimal antigens and cut-off are bPPD, p22 and the combination of ESAT-6/CFP-10 and Rv3020c with a 0.05 Δ optical density, which yielded a up to 100% correct classification of TB positive and negatve red deer under our experimental conditions. This technique will aid in TB testing of farmed and translocated deer. Future studies should evaluate the ability of this IFNγ assay to detect specific responses under field conditions."
1986,2942198,Subpopulations of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen-positive lymphoid cells in normal bone marrow identified by hematopoietic differentiation antigens.,"Bone marrow samples from normal adults and children with nonhematologic malignancies not involving the marrow, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in continued remission, and immune cytopenias were studied by two-color immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry to characterize common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive marrow lymphoid cells. Marrow was separated by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation followed by passage over a monoclonal antibody affinity column to remove myeloid cells prior to IF staining. A higher proportion of CALLA-positive cells was found in the pediatric marrows (mean, 33.7% +/- 6.3% SEM) than in the adult marrows (mean, 4.5% +/- 1.6% SEM). Two subpopulations of CALLA-positive cells identified by cell sorting to be of lymphoid morphology were found in both adult and pediatric marrows. A small subpopulation comprising 12.3% of the total CALLA-positive cells was characterized by a high intensity of CALLA, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and MY10 expression, but low B1, common leukocyte antigen, and peanut agglutinin receptor expression. The remainder of the CALLA-positive cells displayed low intensity of CALLA expression, positivity for the common leukocyte antigen, B1 and peanut agglutinin, and negative reaction with TdT and MY10. Both CALLA-positive subpopulations were positive for HLA-DR and the pan-B cell marker B4, but negative for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, B2 and Leu 1. BrdU labelling studies showed that a similar proportion of cells in each subpopulation was in S phase. A slightly higher proportion of the strongly CALLA-positive cells possessed the morphologic features of high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and prominent nucleoli. These studies suggest that a discrete maturation step occurs among CALLA-positive marrow lymphoid cells, resulting in the loss of TdT and MY10 expression, but gradual acquisition of the B cell marker B1 and the common leukocyte antigen. The presence of B4 antigen in nearly all CALLA-positive cells suggests that both subpopulations of normal CALLA-positive marrow cells are committed to the B cell lineage."
2014,25138695,Coacervate delivery systems for proteins and small molecule drugs.,"Coacervates represent an exciting new class of drug delivery vehicles, developed in the past decade as carriers of small molecule drugs and proteins. This review summarizes several well-described coacervate systems, including: i) elastin-like peptides for delivery of anticancer therapeutics; ii) heparin-based coacervates with synthetic polycations for controlled growth factor delivery; iii) carboxymethyl chitosan aggregates for oral drug delivery; iv) Mussel adhesive protein and hyaluronic acid coacervates. Coacervates present advantages in their simple assembly and easy incorporation into tissue engineering scaffolds or as adjuncts to cell therapies. They are also amenable to functionalization such as for targeting or for enhancing the bioactivity of their cargo. These new drug carriers are anticipated to have broad applications and noteworthy impact in the near future. "
2009,19330884,"Ameliorating effect of Kalpaamruthaa, a Siddha preparation in adjuvant induced arthritis in rats with reference to changes in proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins.","As disease initiation and propagation still represents a research question in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the cytokines play a central role in the inflammatory articular process including the synovial proliferation and cartilage destruction in RA and understanding the role of these cytokines in turn exploits them as therapeutic targets in RA.The present study illustrates the beneficial outcome of the Siddha drug Kalpaamruthaa (KA) in reducing the pathological lesions caused by the proinflammatory cytokines in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. KA consists of Semecarpus anacardium nut milk extract (SA), dried powder of Emblica officinalis fruit and honey.Both SA and KA were administered at dose of 150 mg/kg b.wt. for 14 days after 14 days of adjuvant injection in rats. The protein expressions of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), the levels of acute phase proteins, immunoglobulins and the radiological, histopathological and electron microscopical changes in control and experimental animals were analyzed.Both SA and KA significantly regulated the inflammation in arthritic joints by reducing extracellular matrix degradation and cartilage and bone destruction via down regulating the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, as well the levels of acute phase proteins with appreciable increase in the levels of immunoglobulins in arthritic rats. Of both the drugs KA exhibited a profound effect than sole treatment of SA and the enhanced effect of KA might be attributed to the combined effect of the flavonoids, tannins, vitamin C and other phytoconstituents present in the drug."
2015,25546022,Fate of flame retardants and the antimicrobial agent triclosan in planted and unplanted biosolid-amended soils.,"A comprehensive understanding of the fate of contaminant-laden biosolids is needed to fully evaluate the environmental impacts of biosolid land application. The present study examined the fate of several flame retardants and triclosan in biosolid-amended soil in a 90-d greenhouse experiment. Objectives included evaluating the persistence of these compounds in soil, their phytoaccumulation potential by alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and potential degradation reactions. Concentrations of the polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners BDE-47 and BDE-209 and the antimicrobial triclosan declined significantly over time in biosolid-amended soil planted with alfalfa and then reached a steady state by day 28. In contrast, no significant losses of those analytes were observed from soil in nonvegetated pots. The amount of an analyte lost from vegetated soil ranged from 43% for the flame retardant di(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromophthalate to 61% for triclosan and was significantly and negatively related to the log octanol-water partition coefficient. Alfalfa roots and shoots were monitored for the compounds, but no clear evidence of phytoaccumulation was observed. Methyl triclosan formation was observed in the biosolid-amended soils during the study period, indicating in situ biotransformation of triclosan. The present study demonstrates that, although they are highly recalcitrant, PBDEs, selected alternate brominated flame retardants, and triclosan are capable of undergoing dissipation from biosolid-amended soils in the presence of plants."
2009,19398645,Effects of cranberry juice on pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam antibiotics following oral administration.,"Cranberry juice consumption is often recommended along with low-dose oral antibiotics for prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Because multiple membrane transporters are involved in the intestinal absorption and renal excretion of beta-lactam antibiotics, we evaluated the potential risk of pharmacokinetic interactions between cranberry juice and the beta-lactams amoxicillin (amoxicilline) and cefaclor. The amoxicillin-cranberry juice interaction was investigated in 18 healthy women who received on four separate occasions a single oral test dose of amoxicillin at 500 mg and 2 g with or without cranberry juice cocktail (8 oz) according to a crossover design. A parallel cefaclor-cranberry juice interaction study was also conducted in which 500 mg cefaclor was administered with or without cranberry juice cocktail (12 oz). Data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods and nonlinear mixed-effects compartmental modeling. We conclude that the concurrent use of cranberry juice has no significant effect on the extent of oral absorption or the renal clearance of amoxicillin and cefaclor. However, delays in the absorption of amoxicillin and cefaclor were observed. These results suggest that the use of cranberry juice at usual quantities as prophylaxis for UTI is not likely to alter the pharmacokinetics of these two oral antibiotics."
2015,25053025,The efficacy of kaolin particle film on oil quality indices of olive trees (Olea europaea L.) cv 'Zard' grown under warm and semi-arid region of Iran.,"Kaolin particle film (0%, 3% and 6%; w/v), as an antitranspirant treatment, was applied to mature 'Zard' olive trees (Olea europaea L.). Olive oil was extracted from harvested fruit and fatty acid composition and other oil quality indices of the fruit assessed over crop seasons. Kaolin increased chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, but decreased peroxide and iodine values, and UV absorbance extinction coefficients, of the oil. The highest palmitic acid was observed in the oil obtained from untreated trees (17%). Kaolin increased oleic acid up to 65% and 64% in the first and second crop seasons, respectively, but decreased linoleic and linolenic acid contents. Monounsaturated acids (65%) and oleic acid/linoleic acid ratios (4) were higher in oil obtained from kaolin treated than untreated trees. Therefore it can be expected that extracted olive oil from kaolin treated trees has a higher oxidative stability and shelf life than untreated trees. "
2018,30294927,Co-administration of nuciferine reduces the concentration of metformin in liver via differential inhibition of hepatic drug transporter OCT1 and MATE1.,"Nuciferine (NF), one of the main and effective components in Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. leaf extracts, is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of obesity-related diseases, while metformin is a first line therapeutic drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Since nuciferine and metformin are likely to be co-administered, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether co-administration of nuciferine would influence the liver (target tissue) distribution and the anti-diabetic effect of metformin by inhibiting hepatic organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1). The data demonstrated that nuciferine significantly reduced metformin accumulation in MDCK cells stably expressing human OCT1 (MDCK-hOCT1) or hMATE1 (MDCK-hMATE1), and primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. Furthermore, the presence of nuciferine in the basal compartment caused a concentration-dependent reduction of intracellular metformin accumulation in MDCK-hOCT1/hMATE1 cell monolayers. Compared with the metformin treatment-alone group, co-administration of nuciferine (40 mg/kg) markedly reduced the metformin concentration in mouse livers at 30 and 60 min after a single oral dose of metformin (200 mg/kg), and subsequently impaired the glucose-lowering effect of metformin (200 mg/kg), but the glucose-lowering effect became no different at 90 and 120 min. Therefore, nuciferine influenced the liver concentration and glucose-lowering effect of metformin only for a period of time after dose, administration of nuciferine and metformin with an interval might prevent the drug-drug interaction mediated by OCT1 and MATE1."
2013,23449322,Inhibitory effects of acorn extract on glutamate-induced calcium signaling in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.,"Various effects of acorn extract have been reported including antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and the levels of acetylcholine and its related enzyme activities in the dementia mouse models. However, it is unclear whether acorn extract inhibits glutamate-induced calcium signaling in hippocampal neurons. This study was an investigation into the effect of acorn extract on intracellular free Ca concentrations ([Ca]) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using fura-2-based digital calcium imaging and photometry. Hippocampal neurons were used between 10 and 14 d in culture from embryonic day-18 rats. Treatment with acorn extract (1 µg/mL to 1 mg/mL) for 30 min inhibited glutamate (100 µM)-induced [Ca] increases in a dose-dependent manner (IC=46.9 µg/mL). After depletion of intracellular Ca stores by treatment with the inhibitor endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, thapsigargin (1 µM), treatment with acorn extract (50 µg/mL) for 30 min decreased the subsequent glutamate-induced [Ca] increases. Acorn extract significantly inhibited (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) (30 µM)-induced [Ca] increases. In addition, acorn extract inhibited the AMPA-induced [Ca] responses in the presence of 1 µM nimodipine. Acorn extract also significantly inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 µM)-induced [Ca] increases. Acorn extract significantly inhibited 50 mM KCl -induced [Ca] increases. Acorn extract significantly inhibited (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine-induced [Ca] responses. Moreover, acorn extract almost completely blocked synaptically mediated [Ca] spikes induced by decreasing extracellular Mg concentration to 0.1 mM. These results suggest that acorn extract inhibits synaptically induced frequent [Ca] spikes through multiple pathways such as ionotropic glutamate receptors, voltage-gated Ca channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons."
2007,17298695,Daily intake of conjugated linoleic acid-enriched yoghurts: effects on energy metabolism and adipose tissue gene expression in healthy subjects.,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a group of positional and geometric isomers of conjugated dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid. The present study was designed to determine whether 14-week CLA supplementation as triacylglycerols (3.76 g) with a 50 : 50 combination of the two main isomers (35 % cis-9, trans-11 and 35 % trans-10, cis-12) added to flavoured yoghurt-like products was able to alter body composition in healthy subjects and to alter the expression of several key adipose tissue genes (PPAR gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2)). Forty-four healthy subjects were randomly assigned to consume daily either a CLA-supplemented yoghurt-like product or a placebo yoghurt for 98 d. There were no significant effects of CLA supplementation on body weight, fat mass or free fat mass. Basal energy expenditure expressed as kg free fat mass increased significantly in the CLA group (123.3 (SEM 2.5) kJ/kg free fat mass per d on day 98 v. 118.7 (SEM 2.3) kJ/kg free fat mass per d on day 0, P = 0.03). PPAR gamma mRNA gene expression increased significantly with CLA supplementation (53 (SEM 20) %, P < 0.01) and a significant reduction in mRNA levels of HSL was observed ( - 42 (SEM 7) %, P = 0.01). The levels of UCP-2 and LPL mRNA were not affected. The present results suggest that a 98 d supplementation diet with a 50 : 50 mixture of the two CLA isomers cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 in a dairy product was unable to alter body composition, although a significant increase in the RMR has been induced. Moreover, changes in mRNA PPAR gamma and HSL in adipose tissue were recorded."
2013,24396296,Alginate encapsulation of Begonia microshoots for short-term storage and distribution.,"Synthetic seeds were formed from shoot tips of two in vitro grown Begonia cultivars using 3% sodium alginate in Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) salt solution as the gel matrix and 100 mM calcium chloride for complexation. Synthetic seed formation was achieved by releasing the sodium alginate/explant combination into 100 mM calcium chloride (CaCl₂ ·H₂O) solution for 30 or 45 min. Both control and encapsulated shoots were transferred into sterile Petri dishes and stored at 4°C or 22°C for 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks. Conversion of synthetic seeds into plantlets for both storage environments was assessed in MS medium or peat-based substrate. No significant difference was found between the 30 and 45 min CaCl₂ ·H₂O treatments or the two cultivars. Encapsulation of explants improved survival rate over time irrespective of the medium type or storage environment. Survival rates of 88, 53, 28, and 11% for encapsulated microshoots versus 73, 13, 0, and 0% for control explants were achieved in microshoots stored for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. The best results were obtained when synthetic seeds were stored at 4°C and germinated on MS medium. Regenerated plantlets were successfully established in potting soil."
2013,23302496,Murraya koenigii leaf extract inhibits proteasome activity and induces cell death in breast cancer cells.,"Inhibition of the proteolytic activity of 26S proteasome, the protein-degrading machine, is now considered a novel and promising approach for cancer therapy. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitors have been demonstrated to selectively kill cancer cells and also enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, polyphenols/flavonoids have been reported to inhibit proteasome activity. Murraya koenigii Spreng, a medicinally important herb of Indian origin, has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Here we show that Murraya koenigii leaves (curry leaves), a rich source of polyphenols, inhibit the proteolytic activity of the cancer cell proteasome, and cause cell death.Hydro-methanolic extract of curry leaves (CLE) was prepared and its total phenolic content [TPC] determined by, the Folin-Ciocalteau's method. Two human breast carcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and a normal human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38 were used for the studies. Cytotoxicity of the CLE was assessed by the MTT assay. We studied the effect of CLE on growth kinetics using colony formation assay. Growth arrest was assessed by cell cycle analysis and apoptosis by Annexin-V binding using flow cytometry. Inhibition of the endogenous 26S proteasome was studied in intact cells and cell extracts using substrates specific to 20S proteasomal enzymes.CLE decreased cell viability and altered the growth kinetics in both the breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It showed a significant arrest of cells in the S phase albeit in cancer cells only. Annexin V binding data suggests that cell death was via the apoptotic pathway in both the cancer cell lines. CLE treatment significantly decreased the activity of the 26S proteasome in the cancer but not normal cells.Our study suggests M. koenigii leaves to be a potent source of proteasome inhibitors that lead to cancer cell death. Therefore, identification of active component(s) from the leaf extract could lead to the development of anti-cancer agents which could be useful in the treatment of different types of cancers."
2019,30236689,Lipase-catalyzed glycerolysis of anchovy oil in a solvent-free system: Simultaneous optimization of monoacylglycerol synthesis and end-product oxidative stability.,"The production of mono- and diacylglycerols rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids is achieved in this study, by solvent-free glycerolysis of anchovy oil with lipase PS-DI from Burkholderia cepacia. Attention is focused on the oxidative stability of the reaction products, determined in terms of induction time (It). The effects of glycerol/triacylglycerol molar ratio, enzyme concentration, and reaction temperature on mono- and diacylglycerol production and It are all assessed. The operating conditions that optimized monoacylglycerol yields and oxidative stability were a glycerol/triacylglycerol ratio of 3/1, 9.0% (w/w) Lipase PS-DI, a stirring rate of 200 rpm, and a reaction time of 4 h, at 45.8 °C, producing a content of 24.8% and 51.9% of mono- and diacylglycerols, respectively, over an It of 1.41 h. The glycerolysis conditions determined by simultaneous optimization strategy increased the oxidative stability of the glycerolysis products by 68%, which rose from 0.84 h (individual optimization) to 1.41 h."
2018,29778019,Phoenix dactylifera protects against oxidative stress and hepatic injury induced by paracetamol intoxication in rats.,"The current studies were sought to determine effects of antioxidant potential of aqueous and methanolic extracts of Phoenix dactylifera leaves (PLAE and PLME) against the widely-used analgesic paracetamol (PCM) induced hepatotoxicity. Groups of rats were treated with or without PCM (1500 mg/kg), PLAE and PLME (300 mg/kg) and n-acetylcysteine (NAC, 50 mg/kg) followed by assessments of liver function tests, oxidative stress, antioxidant defenses, and hepatotoxicity. We observed that PCM significantly elevated serum liver markers, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin compared to control (untreated) group. These PCM-induced effects were associated with oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced levels of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Pretreatment of PLME decreased ALT and AST by 78.2% and tissue MDA by 54.1%, and increased hepatic GPx (3.5 folds), CAT (7 folds) and SOD (2.5 folds) compared to PCM group. These PLME-mediated effects were comparable to NAC pretreatment. Histological analysis demonstrates that PLME conserved hepatic tissues against lesions such as inflammation, centrilobular necrosis, and hemorrhages induced by PCM. In contrast, PLAE-mediated effects were less effective in reducing levels of liver function enzymes, oxidative stress, and liver histopathological profiles, and restoring antioxidant defenses against PCM-induced intoxication. These findings indicate that PLME exerts protective effects against PCM-induced hepatotoxicity via scavenging free radicals and restoring hepatic antioxidant enzymes. Thus, PLME and its bioactive components could further be evaluated for their pharmacological properties against drug-induced deleterious effects."
2017,28414158,"Methotrexate hepatotoxicity is associated with oxidative stress, and down-regulation of PPARγ and Nrf2: Protective effect of 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid.","18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA) is a bioactive component of licorice with promising hepatoprotective activity. However, its protective mechanism on methotrexate (MTX) hepatotoxicity in not well defined. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of 18β-GA, pointing to the role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and the redox-sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Wistar rats were orally administered 18β-GA (50 and 100 mg/kg) 7 days either before or after MTX injection. MTX induced significant increase in circulating liver function marker enzymes and bilirubin with concomitant declined albumin levels. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and liver malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were significantly increased in MTX-induced rats. Treatment with 18β-GA significantly reduced serum enzymes of liver function, bilirubin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 18β-GA attenuated MTX-induced oxidative stress and restored the antioxidant defenses. In addition, 18β-GA improved liver histological structure and decreased the expression of Bax whereas increased Bcl-2 expression. MTX-induced rats showed significant down-regulation of Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1 and PPARγ, an effect that was markedly reversed by 18β-GA supplemented either before or after MTX. In conclusion, 18β-GA protected against MTX-induced liver injury, possibly by activating Nrf2 and PPARγ, and subsequent attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore, 18β-GA can provide protection against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity."
2015,26268459,Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on experimental cardiac remodeling.,"To investigate the ameliorated effects of an extract of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on experimental cardiac remodeling in rats induced by acute cardiac infarction, and further explore the mechanism concentrated on myocardial type I collagen, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and provide the experimental data for clinical application of GBE.Rats were divided into five groups (n = 20) as following: sham operation group (group A), acute myocardial infarction model group (group B), acute myocardial infarction model + aspirin (10 mg/kg) treatment group (group C), acute myocardial infarction model + captopril (20 mg/kg) treatment group (group D) and acute myocardial infarction model + Ginkgo biloba extract (100 mg/kg) treatment group (group E). The rat acute myocardial infarction model was reproduced by ligaturing the left anterior descending artery excluding the sham operation group which did not ligation only completed the operational process. Each group was further subdivided into treatment regimens lasting 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to detect the protein expression and mRNA transcriptional levels of rat myocardial TGF-β1, type I collagen, MMP-2 and MMP-9.Compared with group B, regardless of the length of treatment (4 or 8 weeks), the TGF-β1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA transcriptional levels, and the protein expression levels of type I collagen, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in groups D, C and E were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1 in groups D, C and E were significantly lower after 8 weeks compared to after 4 weeks (P < 0.01), as were the expression levels of type I collagen in groups D, C and E (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the protein expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 between groups E and C.GBE could inhibit experimental rat myocardial remodeling after acute myocardial infarction via reduced transcription of TGF-β1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes and by the decreased expression of type I collagen, MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins in myocardial cells."
1996,8639774,Relative reactivity of platelets from thrombopoietin- and interleukin-6-treated dogs.,"Previous reports have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) enhances the responsiveness of platelets to thrombin stimulation and has modest thrombocytopoietic effects in vivo. Thrombopoietin (TPO; mpl ligand) has been shown to have dramatic thrombocytopoietic effect in vivo, but little is known of its capacity to alter platelet function. In this study, a direct comparison of the effects of IL-6 and TPO on platelet function in dogs has been performed, with modest doses of TPO (1 microgram/kg/d) chosen to match or moderately exceed the platelet counts achieved with IL-6 (40 micrograms/kg/d) for 10 days. Platelet responsiveness to thrombin stimulation was assessed in TPO-treated, IL-6-treated, and control dogs by flow cytometric measurement of P-selectin expression. On day 5, the dose of thrombin promoting half maximal stimulation (EC50) of platelets was not significantly changed in TPO-treated dogs, whereas in IL-6-treated dogs the EC50 decreased to 73.1% +/- 6.1% (mean +/- 1 SD; n = 5) of control values (P < 0.01). These experiments were performed on both gel-filtered platelets and washed whole blood, indicating that the observed changes in EC50 were caused by cytokine-mediated alteration of platelets rather than plasma components. Because it has been shown that thiazole orange specifically labels a subpopulation of dog platelets that is less than 24 hours old, the thrombin responsiveness of these young, newly synthesized platelets was determined. The EC50 of thiazole orange-positive platelets from IL-6-treated dogs decreased dramatically by day 5 to 46.5% +/- 13.1% (n = 4) of control values (P < 0.001), whereas TPO-treated dogs did not significantly change. When TPO was directly incubated with platelets ex vivo, no effects on either thrombin-mediated P-selectin expression or adenosine diphosphate-induced fibrinogen binding were observed. These data show that IL-6 alters platelet function, as measured by reactivity to thrombin, whereas TPO does not. This divergence in function is observed even though TPO is equally, or more, effective at promoting platelet production under these experimental conditions."
2013,23692769,"Polyphenolic pattern and in vitro cardioprotective properties of typical red wines from vineyards cultivated in Scafati (Salerno, Italy).","Wines are the subject of increasing numbers of investigations owing to the pharmaceutical usefulness of grape phytochemicals. The aim of the present work was to hypothesize the use of lyophilised red wines for the formulation of food supplements potentially useful against both physiological and induced cardiac oxidative stress. Cardiac derived H9C2 myocytes were incubated with increasing doses (0.01-1μg) of lyophilised Aglianico wine (lioAW). Experiments showed an appreciable direct radical scavenging activity at a maximum lioAW dose of 0.03μg that made the caspase-3 activity decrease by about 41%. Cardiac cells were exposed to 1μM doxorubicin and its combination with different doses of lioAW. Maximum lioAW aliquot of 0.03μg seemed to effectively contrast the induced oxidant injury decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROSs) levels by about 38%and depressing the caspase-3 activity by about 63%. In both assays, pro-oxidant effects at higher lioAW concentrations were detected."
2000,10814878,"Inhibition of benzo[a]pyrene- and 1,6-dinitropyrene-DNA adduct formation in human mammary epithelial cells bydibenzoylmethane and sulforaphane.","Numerous phytochemicals have been examined for their capacity to act as cancer chemopreventive agents. Dibenzoylmethane, a minor constituent of licorice and a compound structurally-related to curcumin, recently was identified as an effective inhibitor of chemically-induced rat mammary DNA-adduct formation and tumorigenesis (Carcinogenesis 19(1998)1039-1043). The present studies were conducted to examine the capacity of dibenzoylmethane to inhibit the formation of DNA adducts following exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP), and to stimulate the expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H-quinone reductase (QR) proteins in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10F. In addition, the efficacy of dibenzoylmethane as an enzyme inducer and adduct inhibitor was compared with that of sulforaphane, a potent inducer of phase II detoxification enzymes and inhibitor of chemically-induced rat mammary tumorigenesis. Dibenzoylmethane at concentrations from 0.1 M to 2.0 microM inhibited BP-DNA adduct formation by 63 to 81%. Likewise, sulforaphane inhibited BP-DNA adduct formation by 68 to 80% over the same concentration range. DNA adduct formation following exposure to 1,6-DNP was significantly inhibited by 46 to 61% due to dibenzoylmethane treatment (0.1 to 2.0 microM) and 30 to 56% due to sulforaphane treatment at the same concentrations. The expression of QR and GSTP1-1 proteins were increased by 3 to 4-fold and 3 to 5-fold, respectively, for MCF-10F cells treated with sulforaphane (0.5-2.0 microM). Dibenzoylmethane treatment at the same concentrations did not induce GSTP1-1 expression and significantly stimulated QR expression only at the 2.0 microM concentration. These data indicate that human mammary epithelial MCF-10F cells can convert BP and 1,6-DNP to DNA-binding forms, and that DNA adduct formation can be inhibited by the phytochemicals dibenzoylmethane and sulforaphane. The inhibition of BP-DNA and 1, 6-DNP adduct formation by sulforaphane was associated with increases in QR and GST protein expression. The mechanisms underlying the capacity of dibenzoylmethane to inhibit BP-DNA and 1,6-DNP-DNA adduct formation could not be explained by changes in QR or GST expression and remain to be determined. Together these data suggest that dibenzoylmethane and sulforaphane warrant continued evaluation as breast cancer chemopreventive agents."

2015,25554602,Coordinated regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation on microstructured titanium surfaces by endogenous bone morphogenetic proteins.,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into osteoblasts on microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces without addition of medium supplements, suggesting that surface-dependent endogenous mechanisms are involved. They produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which regulate MSC differentiation and bone formation via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms that are modulated by changes in BMP mRNA and protein, receptors, and inhibitors (Noggin, Cerberus, Gremlin 1, and Chordin). We examined expression of BMPs, their receptors and their inhibitors over time and used BMP2-silenced cells to determine how modulating endogenous BMP signaling can affect the process. MSCs were cultured on tissue culture polystyrene or Ti [PT (Ra<0.4 μm); sandblasted/acid-etched Ti (SLA, Ra=3.2 μm); or hydrophilic-SLA (modSLA)]. BMP mRNAs and proteins increased by day 4 of culture. Exogenous BMP2 increased differentiation whereas differentiation was decreased in BMP2-silenced cells. Noggin was regulated by day 2 whereas Gremlin 1 and Cerberus were regulated after 6days. Osteoblastic differentiation increased in cells cultured with blocking antibodies against Noggin, Gremlin 1, and Cerberus. Endogenous BMPs enhance an osteogenic microenvironment whereas exogenous BMPs are inhibitory. Antibody blocking of the BMP2 inhibitor Cerberus resulted in IL-6 and IL-8 levels that were similar to those observed when treating cells with exogenous BMP2, while antibodies targeting the inhibitors Gremlin or Noggin did not. These results suggest that microstructured titanium implants supporting therapeutic stem cells may be treated with appropriately selected agents antagonistic to extracellular BMP inhibitors in order to enhance BMP2 mediated bone repair while avoiding undesirable inflammatory side effects observed with exogenous BMP2 treatment."
2015,25653004,Effects of selenium and cadmium on changes in the gene expression of immune cytokines in chicken splenic lymphocytes.,"Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental pollutant that is considered to be a potent toxin to organisms. Selenium (Se) has been known for its concomitant biological effects and characteristics with Cd. Due to the lack of the research regarding how the duality of Cd/Se affects immune cytokines in poultry, this paper aims to partly tackle this question. Chicken splenic lymphocytes with Cd (10(-6) mol/L CdCl2), Se (10(-7) mol/L Na2SeO3), Cd + Se (10(-7) mol/L Na2SeO3 and 10(-6) mol/L CdCl2), and a control group were incubated for 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h, respectively. At each time point, the cells were collected and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were also examined. Compared with the control group and the Se-alone-treated group, the mRNA expression levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ decreased significantly in the Cd-alone-treated group. By contrast, the mRNA expression level of IL-1β markedly increased. Levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ in Cd + Se-treated groups were significantly higher than those in Cd-alone-treated groups; however, the levels were not as high as the Se-alone-treated groups and the control group. The mRNA expression level of IL-1β in the Cd + Se-treated group was lower than in the Cd-alone-treated group. The relationships with IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were found to be closer in the PC 1 matrix and 3D plot of the principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. IL-17 and IFN-γ were closer in the matrix of PC 2. However, IL-1β gene expression appeared to be isolated in the matrix of PC 3. In addition, the results of cytokine cluster analysis showed that IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ were in the first group and that IL-1β was in the second group. Therefore, Se partly attenuate immune toxicity induced by Cd in chicken splenic lymphocytes. "
2008,18096091,Lupin protein influences the expression of hepatic genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol hydrolysis of adult rats.,"To assess the effect of lupin protein on concentrations of lipids in plasma lipoproteins and liver and hepatic mRNA concentrations of genes involved in lipid metabolism, adult rats were fed egg albumin-based diets containing either lupin protein from Lupinus albus or casein (50 g/kg) supplemented (hypercholesterolaemic) or not (normolipaemic) with a cholesterol-cholate mixture for 20 d. Lupin protein compared with casein lowered the concentrations of TAG in liver (P < 0.01) and circulating VLDL + chylomicrons (P < 0.05) of hypercholesterolaemic rats, but not of normolipaemic rats. Hepatic mRNA concentrations of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase were lower and mRNA concentrations of lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase and apoA5 involved in TAG hydrolysis were higher in rats fed lupin protein than in rats fed casein. These effects were stronger in hypercholesterolaemic rats than in normolipaemic rats. Hypercholesterolaemic rats fed the lupin protein had higher liver cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01) and lower levels of LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.05) than rats fed casein. No effect of lupin protein was observed on cholesterol concentration in VLDL + chylomicrons and HDL and hepatic mRNA concentrations of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. In conclusion, the present study shows that lupin protein has hypotriacylglycerolaemic action possibly via down regulation of fatty acid synthesis genes and up regulation of genes involved in TAG hydrolysis. Alterations in cholesterol metabolism could not be explained on the basis of mRNA data."
2016,26746431,Protective effects of Arctium lappa L. root extracts (AREs) on high fat diet induced quail atherosclerosis.,"This study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of Arctium lappa L. root extracts (AREs) from different extraction methods (aqueous, ethanol, chloroform and flavone) on atherosclerosis.Quails (Coturnix coturnix) were subjected to high fat diet, with or without one of the four different AREs or positive control simvastatin. Blood samples were collected before treatment, after 4.5 weeks or ten weeks to assess lipid profile (Levels of total cholesterol (TC), Triacylglycerol (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)). After ten weeks, the serum levels of nitric oxide (NO) as well as antioxidant and pro-oxidative status (Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)) were measured. Furthermore, aortas were collected after ten weeks treatment, aorta lipid contents (TC, TG and LDL) were assessed, and histology was used to confirm atherosclerotic changes.The results indicated that high fat diet significantly deteriorated lipid profile and antioxidant status in quail serum, while all the extracts significantly reverted the changes similar to simvastatin. Aorta lipid profile assessment revealed similar results. Histology on aortas from quails treated for ten weeks confirmed atherosclerotic changes in high fat diet group, while the extracts significantly alleviated the atherosclerotic changes similar to simvastatin. Among the different extracts, flavones fraction exerted best protective effects.Our data suggest that the protective effects of AREs were medicated via hypolipidemic and anti-oxidant effects. Underlying molecular mechanisms are under investigation."

2014,25106639,The potential role of Morus alba leaves extract on the brain of mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni.,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease which is associated with neuropsychiatric and neuropathological disorders. Herein, the main goal of the presented work is to investigate the effect of Morus alba leaves extract in mice brain infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Since, the resistance of Schistosomes to antischistosomal drug (praziquantel) has been examined, schistosomiasis induced brain oxidative stress as evidenced by the decrease of glutathione level, total antioxidant capacity and the activity of catalase significantly, while a significant elevation in the levels of nitrite/nitrate and malondialdhyde. In addition, the infection resulted in neurochemical disturbances, the main inhibitory amino acid, γ- aminobutyric acid level was decreased. In contrast, the level of chloride ions and acetylcholine esterase activity were significantly increased. Moreover, the histopathological section showed some impairments in the brain. The treatment with Morus alba leaves extract ameliorated the induced disturbances in schistosome-infected mice where the levels of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants were elevated. On the other hand, the levels of nitrite/nitrate and malondialdhyde were significantly reduced. Likewise, treatment of mice with Morus alba leaves extract improved the altered levels of γ- aminobutyric acid level and chloride ion. Also, it improved the recorded impairments of the histopathological section in the brain of schistosome infected mice. "
2015,25579848,Investigation on the effect of polymer and starch on the tablet properties of lyophilized orally disintegrating tablet.,"Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) is a user friendly and convenient dosage form. The study aimed to investigate the effect of polymers and wheat starch on the tablet properties of lyophilized ODT, with dapoxetine as model drug. Three polymers (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carbopol 934P and Eudragit® EPO) and wheat starch were used as matrix forming materials in preparation of lyophilized ODT. The polymeric dispersion was casted into a mould and kept in a freezer at -20 °C for 4 h before freeze dried for 12 h. It was found that increasing in HPMC and Carbopol 934P concentrations produced tablets with higher hardness and longer disintegration time. In contrast, Eudragit® EPO was unable to form tablet with sufficient hardness at various concentrations. Moreover, HPMC seems to have a stronger effect on tablet hardness compared to Carbopol 934P at the same concentration level. ODT of less friable was obtained. Wheat starch acted as binder which strengthen the hardness of ODTs and prolonged the disintegration time. ODT comprising of HPMC and wheat starch at ratio of 2:1 was found to be optimum based upon the tablet properties. The optimum formulation was palatable and 80 % of the drug was released within 30 min in the dissolution study."
2001,11260088,The impact of attaining a minimal disease state after high-dose melphalan and autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma.,"Initial studies with high-dose therapy (HDT) in myeloma suggest some beneficial effects of attaining a complete response (CR); however, the effect on survival is difficult to assess owing to inconsistencies in the definition of response between studies. We have analysed 96 newly diagnosed patients aged less than 65 years who received HDT and assessed the effect of response on survival using electrophoresis, immunofixation and fluorescent IgH polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to define CR. Patients received induction chemotherapy with C-VAMP (adriamycin, vincristine, methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide) followed by melphalan 200 mg/m2 and reinfusion of peripheral blood stem cells. There was a high response to C-VAMP [CR = 24%, partial response (PR) = 64%], with all but one patient improving the depth of response after HDT (CR = 69%, PR = 31%). The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were excellent at a median of 46.4 months and 72+ months. There was a trend towards an improved PFS in patients with an immunofixation-negative CR compared with patients with a PR (49.4 months, 41.14 months; P = 0.26). This was not evident when electrophoresis was used to define CR. The method used to define CR did not impact on the overall survival and fluorescent IgH PCR failed to add any additional prognostic information. This study supports the widespread use of the European Bone Marrow Transplantation group (EBMT) response criteria and suggests that immunofixation should be performed on all patients who become electrophoresis negative."
2016,30084567,Effect of ethanolic extract of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on central nervous system activity in mice.,"Zingiber officinale Roscoe, commonly known as ginger, is a traditional herb used to treat various disorders. In this study, we evaluated potential pharmacological effects of ethanolic extracts of Z. Officinale with respect to central nervous system (CNS) activity in mice. Role of ethanolic extract of ginger on CNS activity in mice was studied using models of elevated plus maze test, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, tail suspension test, hot-plate and tail-flick test. Ginger extract was administered to mice at single doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg, perorally while diazepam (1 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg) and imipramine (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally were used as standard drugs. The results showed that the ginger extract at all dose levels significantly exhibited anxiolytic activityincreased the sleeping latency but reduced the sleeping time. Tail suspension test showed that the extract at both the doses was able to induce a significant decrease in the immobility time, similar to imipramine, a recognized antidepressant drug. Tail-flick and hot-plate tests demonstrated antinociceptive property of ginger extract, similar to morphine, a recognized antinociceptive agent. Higher dose level (200 mg/kg) showed better protective effects. Phytochemical screening of ethanolic extract revealed the presence of various phytoconstituents such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, carbohydrates, glycosides, proteins, resins and volatile oils. The possible mechanism by which ginger exhibited the significant beneficial effects on various CNS models in mice could be attributed to its antioxidant potential."
1997,9194985,Stability of granisetron hydrochloride in an extemporaneously prepared oral liquid.,"The stability of granisetron 0.2 mg/mL (as the hydrochloride salt) in an extemporaneously prepared oral liquid was studied. Twelve 1-mg granisetron tablets were pulverized and suspended in 30 mL of distilled water. This mixture was then diluted with cherry syrup to produce a 60-mL oral liquid with a granisetron concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Half of the preparation was stored at 5 degrees C, and half was stored at 24 degrees C. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. There was no change in the liquid's color, consistency, or pH, and the concentrations of granisetron ranged from 97% to 104% of initial concentration during the 14 days at 5 and 24 degrees C. Granisetron 0.2 mg/mL (as the hydrochloride salt) in an extemporaneously prepared oral liquid was stable for up to 14 days."
2013,23454824,Protective effect of phlorotannins from Eisenia bicyclis against lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammation in HepG2 cells.,"In this study, four bioactive phloroglucinol derivates including phloroglucinol (1), eckol (2), dioxinodehydroeckol (3), and dieckol (4) were isolated from Eisenia bicyclis and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity of these compounds was investigated on human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It was demonstrated that LPS can induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as well as the expression of inflammatory mediators as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) from HepG2 cells. Among isolated compounds, compound (1) exhibited significant inhibition on LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses in HepG2 cells without any cytotoxicity. Herein, compound (1) suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and the expression of COX-2 and iNOS. Thus, these results indicated that phlorotannins isolated from E. bicyclis, especially compound (1), can be used as a beneficial source for preventing and treating inflammation response."
2016,27424936,Characterization of BMP signaling dependent osteogenesis using a BMP depletable avianized bone marrow stromal cell line (TVA-BMSC).,"Adipogenesis, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are BMP signaling dependent differentiation processes. However, the molecular networks operating downstream of BMP signaling to bring about these distinct fates are yet to be fully elucidated. We have developed a novel Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) derived mouse cell line as a powerful in vitro platform to conduct such experiments. This cell line is a derivative of BMSCs isolated from a tamoxifen inducible Bmp2 and Bmp4 double conditional knock-out mouse strain. These BMSCs are immortalized and stably transfected with avian retroviral receptor TVA (TVA-BMSCs), enabling an easy method for stable transduction of multiple genes in these cells. In TVA-BMSCs multiple components of BMP signaling pathway can be manipulated simultaneously. Using this cell line we have demonstrated that for osteogenesis, BMP signaling is required only for the first three days. We have further demonstrated that Klf10, an osteogenic transcription factor which is transcribed in developing bones in a BMP signaling dependent manner, can largely compensate for the loss of BMP signaling during osteogenesis of BMSCs. TVA-BMSCs can undergo chondrogenesis and adipogenesis, and hence may be used for dissection of the molecular networks downstream of BMP signaling in these differentiation processes as well."
2005,15997146,Piperine from the fruits of Piper longum with inhibitory effect on monoamine oxidase and antidepressant-like activity.,"A bioassay-guided isolation of the ethanol extract from the fruits of Piper longum yielded a known piperidine alkaloid, piperine, as a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. Piperine showed an inhibitory effect against MAO-A (IC50 value: 20.9 microM) and MAO-B (IC50 value: 7.0 microM). Kinetic analyses by a Lineweaver-Burk plot clearly indicated that piperine competitively inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B with Ki values of 19.0+/-0.9 microM and 3.19+/-0.5 microM, respectively. The inhibition by piperine was found to be reversible by dialysis of the incubation mixture. In addition, the immobility times in the tail suspension test were significantly reduced by piperine, similar to that of the reference antidepressant fluoxetine, without accompanying changes in ambulation when assessed in an open-field. These results suggest that piperine possesses potent antidepressant-like properties that are mediated in part through the inhibition of MAO activity, and therefore represent a promising pharmacotherapeutic candidate as an antidepressant agent."
2013,23871070,The decay of ascorbic acid in a model wine system at low oxygen concentration.,"The present study investigated the impact of temperature on the degradation of ascorbic acid in low oxygen conditions in a model white wine. The concentrations of ascorbic acid, furfural, sulfur dioxide and phenolic-type products were monitored in a model white wine stored under non-oxidative conditions at 45.0, 36.5 and 24.0 °C for up to 693 days. The concentrations of both ascorbic acid and sulfur dioxide decreased over the analysis period while furfural and other colourless phenolic products increased in concentration, despite the presence of residual sulfur dioxide. The decay of ascorbic acid in the low oxygen conditions followed first-order kinetics and the rate constants were determined to be (3.5±0.2)×10(-8), (1.02±0.07)×10(-8), and (0.184±0.009)×10(-8) s(-1) for 45.0, 36.5 and 24.0 °C (n=5, standard error), respectively, and the activation energy was 110±3 kJ/mol (n=3, standard error). Importantly, these data allow more accurate prediction of the temperature-induced loss of ascorbic acid in low oxygen conditions during transport or storage of wine."
1998,9989890,Biological characterization of CD34+ cells mobilized into peripheral blood.,"We review here the functional and kinetic characteristics of highly purified hematopoietic CD34+ mobilized into peripheral blood (PB) by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without chemotherapy for autologous or allogeneic transplantation. Circulating CD34+ cells were evaluated for their colony-forming capacity and trilineage proliferative response to selected recombinant human (rh) CSF in vitro, and the content of very primitive long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC). In addition, the cycling status of PB CD34+ cells, including committed clonogenic progenitor cells and the more immature LTC-IC, was determined by the cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) suicide test and the acridine orange (AO) flow cytometric technique. By comparison, bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells from the same individuals were studied under steady-state conditions and during G-CSF administration. Clonogenic assays in methylcellulose showed the same frequency of colony-forming unit cells (CFU-C) when PB primed-CD34+ cells and BM cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin-lymphocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM). However, mobilized CD34+ cells were significantly more responsive than their steady-state BM counterparts to interleukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor (SCF) combined with G-CSF or IL-3 in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo). Conversely, circulating and BM megakaryocyte precursors (CFU-MK) showed the same clonogenic efficiency in response to IL-3, GM-CSF and IL-3, IL-6 and Epo. Interestingly, very few CD34+ cells expressed the Mpl receptor and this finding resulted in the lower proliferative response of mobilized CFU-MK to the Mpl-ligand (megakaryocyte growth and development factor; MGDF), as compared to BM cells. After 5 weeks of liquid culture supported by the engineered murine stromal cell line M2-10B4 to produce G-CSF and IL-3, we reported a similar frequency of LTC-IC in PB and steady-state BM. Kinetic studies on PB and BM CD34+ cells, including LTC-IC, showed the low number of circulating progenitor cells in S and G2M phase whereas simultaneous DNA/RNA analysis and the Ara-C suicide assay demonstrated that the majority of PB CD34+ cells and LTC-IC are not quiescent (ie in G0 phase) being in G1 phase. Moreover, G-CSF administration prevented apoptosis in a small but significant proportion of mobilized CD34+ cells. Thus, our results indicate that mobilized and BM CD34+ cells can be considered equivalent for the frequency of both committed and more immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, although they show different kinetic and functional profiles. A further set of experiments indicated that G-CSF treatment did not alter the alloantigen presenting function of CD34+ cells which was mainly mediated by the upregulation of costimulatory molecules upon coincubation with allogeneic T cells. Taken together, these findings should allow a better understanding of PBSC transplantation."
2017,28583132,A bacosides containing Bacopa monnieri extract alleviates allodynia and hyperalgesia in the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain in rats.,"The current therapy of neuropathic pain is inadequate and is limited by the extent of pain relief and the occurrence of dose dependant side effects. Insufficient control of pain with conventional medications prompts the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by patients with neuropathic pain. This study therefore investigated a standardized methanolic extract of Bacopa monnieri, a widely reputed nootropic plant, for prospective antinociceptive effect in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain.Placement of four loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve produced partial denervation of the hindpaw in rats. Bacopa monnieri (40 and 80 mg/kg, p.o) and the positive control, gabapentin (75 mg/kg, i.p), were administered daily after CCI or sham surgery and the behavioral paradigms of static- and dynamic-allodynia (paw withdrawal threshold to von Frey filament stimulation [PWT] and paw withdrawal latency to light-brushing [PWL]), cold-allodynia (paw withdrawal duration [PWD] to acetone), heat- (PWL to heat-stimulus) and punctate-hyperalgesia (PWD to pin-prick) were assessed on days 3, 7, 14 and 21.CCI consistently generated static- (days 3-21), dynamic- (days 14-21) and cold-allodynia (days 3-21) plus heat- and mechano-hyperalgesia (days 3-21). The tested doses of Bacopa monnieri significantly attenuated the CCI-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia, exemplified by increased PWT (days 7-21), PWL to light brushing (days 14-21) and heat (days 7-21) as well as decreased PWD to pin prick and cold stimuli (days 3-21). The extract also counterbalanced the CCI-induced aberrations in the nociceptive behaviors by increasing the pain threshold to that of pre-surgery baseline. Gabapentin also afforded analogous beneficial behavioral profile but of higher magnitude.Our findings suggest that Bacopa monnieri can be used as adjuvant therapy for neuropathic pain conditions afflicted with allodynia and hyperalgesia."
2015,25910439,Rosemary tea consumption results to anxiolytic- and anti-depressant-like behavior of adult male mice and inhibits all cerebral area and liver cholinesterase activity; phytochemical investigation and in silico studies.,"Our aim was to investigate the possible effects of regular drinking of Rosmarinus officinalis L. leaf infusion on behavior and on AChE activity of mice. Rosemary tea (2% w/w) phytochemical profile was investigated through LC/DAD/ESI-MS(n). Adult male mice were randomly divided into two groups: ""Rosemary-treated"" that received orally the rosemary tea for 4weeks and ""control"" that received drinking water. The effects of regular drinking of rosemary tea on behavioral parameters were assessed by passive avoidance, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Moreover, its effects on cerebral and liver cholinesterase (ChE) isoforms activity were examined colorimetricaly. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of diterpenes, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic derivatives in rosemary tea; the major compounds were quantitatively determined. Its consumption rigorously affected anxiety/fear and depression-like behavior of mice, though memory/learning was unaffected. ChE isoforms activity was significantly decreased in brain and liver of ""rosemary treated"" mice. In order to explain the tissue ChE inhibition, principal component analysis, pharmacophore alignment and molecular docking were used to explore a possible relationship between main identified compounds of rosemary tea, i.e. rosmarinic acid, luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, caffeic acid and known AChE inhibitors. Results revealed potential common pharmacophores of the phenolic components with the inhibitors. Our findings suggest that rosemary tea administration exerts anxiolytic and antidepressant effects on mice and inhibits ChE activity; its main phytochemicals may function in a similar way as inhibitors.

1998,9576199,Evaluation of immunotoxins containing single-chain ribosome-inactivating proteins and an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody (OM124): in vitro and in vivo studies.,"Immunotoxins were prepared with three ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), momordin, pokeweed antiviral protein from seeds (PAP-S) and saporin-S6, linked to the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody OM124. These immunotoxins inhibited protein synthesis by CD22-expressing cell lines Daudi, EHM, BJAB, Raji and BM21 with IC50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition) ranging from < 5 x 10(-15) to 7.6 x 10(-11) M as RIP, and IC90 (concentration causing 90% inhibition) ranging from 5 x 10(-14) to 5 x 10(-8)M, with no effect on a CD22-negative HL60 cell line at the highest concentration tested (5 x 10[-8] M). Apoptosis was induced in sensitive cells. The formation of bone marrow colonies was inhibited by no more than 40% by the immunotoxins at concentrations up to 10(-9) M. Treatment with the immunotoxins, alone or in combination, significantly extended the survival time of mice bearing transplanted Daudi cells. A treatment with cyclophosphamide and OM124/saporin immunotoxin was particularly effective in SCID mice transplanted with a low number of cells (3 x 10[-6]), when 60% of the animals remained tumour-free."
,16193818,"The influence of plant raw materials, containing ellagic acid and selected antibiotics on immunological response in mice.","It is demonstrated that the combined addition to a culture of aqueous extracts from tannin pharmacopoeial raw materials, containing elladic acid (Cortex Quercus, Folium Uvae ursi and Rhizoma Tormentillae) and the antibiotics: cefuroxime, cefoperazone and doxycycline influences the enhancement of survival of mouse thymocytes in cultures with supplementation of hydrocortisone. A cytotoxic test was used for the evaluation. The presented results confirmed that each of the applied aqueous extracts shows a better survival of mouse thymocytes after combined addition of an antibiotic to the culture. The extract from Cortex Quercus showed the highest activation when added to the culture with cefuroxime, whereas cefoperazone best stimulation demonstrated when combined with the extract from Rhizoma Tormentillae, and doxycycline with the extract from Folium Uvae ursi."
1980,6969026,Dysgranulopoietic neutropenia and abnormal monocytes in childhood vitamin B12 deficiency.,"Neutropenia and/or leukopenia (associated with elevated serum lysozyme levels) in three children with vitamin B12 deficiency were evaluated using soft agar culture and ultrastructural and cytochemical techniques. In two patients a marked increase in peripheral myeloid colony forming cells (CFC) was observed; whereas a marginal increase in CFC was present in the third, less symptomatic, patient. Marrow CFC was normal or slightly increased. Serum colony stimulating activity (CSA) was normal but elaboration of CSA by white blood cells was low. Normal maturation of the progenitors was present in vitro and serum inhibitors of myelopoiesis were absent. Megaloblastic neutrophils and monocytes with nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony were observed ultrastructurally in directly sampled marrow specimens. These cells contained autophagic and/or heterophagic vacuoles and an increase in cytoplasmic granules. Both monocytes and neutrophils also contained enlarged-disrupted centrioles. Many marrow macrophages contained phagocytic vacuoles, which enclosed disrupted neutrophils and cellular debris."
,1862627,[Amino acid composition and biological value of pastries with protein-rich additives].,"The authors studied amino acid composition of confectionery (bisquits) enriched with dry fat-free milk, dried buttermilk, dry whey and soya bean flour. The biological value of the products was estimated by the sum of essential amino acids, by the ratio of essential amino acids and total nitrogen, by the chemical score and the variation coefficient of the amino acid score. It has been established that confectionery enriched with dry fat-free milk and dried buttermilk contain more lysine than those enriched with soya bean flour. The balance of amino acids is improved in the products enriched with dry fat-free milk and dried buttermilk. To improve the amino acid balance and increase protein content in food products it iz recommended that by-products of milk manufacturing be mildly used."
2013,23790929,Effects of binary organic solvents and heating on lipid removal and the reduction of beany odour in Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranean) flour.,"Effects of various binary organic solvents at different temperatures on the removal of lipids and beany or grassy odour of Bambara groundnut flour were studied. The highest lipid removal was achieved at 60°C (P<0.05), regardless of binary organic solvents used. Under the optimal temperature, chloroform/methanol showed the highest lipid removal (87%), followed by hexane/isopropanol (78%). All binary solvents containing methanol had higher efficiency in removal of phospholipids, and inactivation of lipoxygenase and trypsin inhibitors, as compared to isopropanol containing solvents (P<0.05). Based on FTIR spectra, lipids removed by methanol containing solvents had high content of phospholipids. The flours defatted by methanol containing solvents exhibited the lowest peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and beany odour intensity than the non-defatted flour and those defatted by isopropanol containing solvents throughout the storage (P<0.05) of 30days at refrigerated and room temperatures. In general, chloroform/methanol was the most effective in inactivating lipoxygenase and trypsin inhibitors, retarding lipid oxidation as well as beany odour development in flour. Therefore, chloroform/methanol could be used to lower beany or grassy odour in Bambara groundnut flour. "
2015,25621804,Paediatric reduced intensity conditioning: analysis of centre strategies on regimens and definitions by the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Complications and Quality of Life WP.,"The aim of this analysis was to explore the diversity of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in paediatric allo-SCT in daily practice across Europe. Data from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Promise database from 1994 to 2008 were supplemented by a survey of EBMT centres performing paediatric allo-SCT on the current policy asking for the underlying diseases and for the drug combinations. Records from 161 centres from 30 countries were analysed and 139 various RIC regimens were reported. More centres applied RIC for malignant rather than for non-malignant diseases. In general, fludarabine (FLU)-based regimens predominated except for BU-based regimens in myeloid malignancies and haemoglobinopathies. Treosulfan (TREO) was mainly applied for unspecified malignant diseases and for haemophagocytic diseases. FLU-based regimens revealed the greatest number of different combinations. Correlating the number of regimens with the number of treating centres revealed the lowest variety in FLU and the highest variety in TBI and TREO. FLU/melphalane and FLU/CY were the most frequent combinations. This extreme heterogeneity in RIC may influence both the efficacy and the safety of the procedures, which requires further investigation. Optimization and standardization of RIC is the final goal to provide a platform for future prospective studies. "
2006,16946509,Reproductive effects of ethnomedicinal formulation of tape-vine leaves in female rats.,"Documented ethno-contraceptive use of Tape-vine or Stephania japonica (THUNB.) MIERS., Syn. Stephania hernandifolia (WILLD.) WALP. leaves is evaluated with regards to post-coital pregnancy interceptive activity of its aqueous extract (AE) and an ethnomedicinal formulation (EF) in Wistar rats. EF at 500 and 250 mg/kg doses induced 66.7% and 33.3% post-coital pregnancy interception respectively and the higher dose exhibited significant reduction in number of litters born and also anti-implantation property. In contrast, none of the dose levels of AE interfered in pregnancy but significant anti-implantation property was observed at doses of 2 and 1 g/kg, even as the higher dose produced significant reduction in number of litters born as well. EF at 500 mg/kg also exhibited significant uterotrophic activity and histological changes in uterus. Pair-wise comparison of sex hormone-levels exhibited significant increment in serum estradiol, LH and FSH but decrease in progesterone levels. Assessed blood lipid-carbohydrate profile exhibited substantial decrease in glucose, cholesterol, VLDL and triglyceride contents and significant increase in HDL. It is concluded that EF probably acts as better post-coital pregnancy interceptive agent through restriction of implantation by alteration of gonadal hormone levels and decline in blood-glucose levels that possibly disrupts oxidative energy metabolism in uterus during implantation. High surge in LH and FSH suggests negligible interference in ovulatory mechanism. This preparation also seems to be free of cardiovascular risk factors. HPTLC and HPLC analysis of both EF and AE exhibited marked chemical differences."
2015,26669017,Antiproteolytic and leishmanicidal activity of Coccinia grandis (L.) Voigt leaf extract against Leishmania donovani promastigotes.,"In visceral leishmaniasis (VL), development of alternative safe therapeutic strategy is gaining paramount wherein natural components of plant origin have prominence. We explored Coccinia grandis (L.) Voigt, a medicinal plant known in traditional folk medicine, for its antileishmanial efficacy. SDS-PAGE analysis of the C. grandis leaf extract (Cg-Ex) showed few protein bands about 14-66 kDa among which three (64.8, 55.8 and 15.3 kDa) were identified as serine protease inhibitors by reverse zymography. Since the virulence of Leishmania is also attributed by serine proteases, objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antileishmanial activity of Cg-Ex, targeting Leishmania donovani serine protease(s). Inhibition study of Cg-Ex in gelatin-zymogram and spectrophotometric assay revealed its strong inhibitory activity against bovine trypsin rather than chymotrypsin, and also showed significant inhibition of L. donovani serine protease(s). Further, studies with Cg-Ex were extended to estimate its antileishmanial efficacy with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 308.0 ± 2.42 μg/ml along with significant morphological alterations. The results have demonstrated the potential of the serine protease inhibitor rich fraction of the C. grandis leaf extract against visceral leishmaniasis."
2013,23588117,Ginsenoside Rg1 attenuates okadaic acid induced spatial memory impairment by the GSK3β/tau signaling pathway and the Aβ formation prevention in rats.,"Ginsenoside Rg1, one of the major active ingredients isolated from Panax Ginseng, has been shown notable neuroprotective effects in memory impairment animals. However, the role of ginsenoside Rg1 on cognition capacity damaged by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is still poorly understood, and the underlying mechanism remain to be fully elucidated. Okadaic acid (OKA), a potent phosphatase inhibitor, often apply to imitate Alzheimer's disease-like symptom damaged by neurofibrillary tangles, was used to investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on memory impairment and the related mechanisms in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The anti-dementic drug donepezil was used as a positive contrast. The results showed that OKA intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection induced memory impairment, including changes in the ability of orientation navigate, spatial probe and relearning memory in behavioral test of Morris water maze (MWM). However, treatment with Rg1 and donepezil remarkably alleviated these changes. Also OKA treated rats showed memory impairment including increasing of phospho-tau, decreasing of phospho-GSK3β and the formation of β-amyloid in special brain regions, which were reversed by Rg1 (20 mg/kg) and donepezil (1 mg/kg) administration. All these indicating that ginsenoside Rg1 protects rats against OKA-induced neurotoxicity. The possible neuroprotective mechanism may be that Rg1 decreases OKA-induced memory impairment through GSK3β/tau signaling pathway and/or attenuating Aβ formation. Thus, these studies indicate that ginsenoside Rg1 might be a potential preventive drug for Alzheimer's disease."
2015,25347008,Optimizing drug therapy in pediatric SCT: focus on pharmacokinetics.,"Given age-related differences in drug metabolism and indications for hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), personalized drug dosing of the conditioning regimen and post-transplant immunosuppression may reduce graft rejection, relapse rates and toxicity in pediatric HSCT recipients. This manuscript summarizes the pharmacokinetic/dynamic data of HSCT conditioning and post-grafting immunosuppression, presented at the First Annual Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC) meeting in April 2013. Personalized dosing of BU to a target plasma exposure reduces graft rejection in children and improves relapse/toxicity rates in adults. Current weight-based dosing achieves the target BU exposure in only a minority (24.3%) of children. The initial BU dose should be based on the European Medicines Agency nomogram or population pharmacokinetic models to improve the numbers of children achieving the target exposure. There are limited pharmacokinetic data for treosulfan, CY, fludarabine and alemtuzumab as HSCT conditioning in children. For post-grafting immunosuppression, mycophenolic acid (MPA) clearance may be increased in younger children (<12 years). The preferred MPA pharmacokinetic monitoring parameters and target range are still evolving in HSCT recipients. Multi-institutional trials incorporating properly powered pharmacokinetic/dynamic studies are needed to assess the effect of variability in the plasma exposure of drugs/metabolites on clinical outcomes in pediatric HSCT recipients.

2000,10923862,"Sulphation of resveratrol, a natural product present in grapes and wine, in the human liver and duodenum.","1. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine, has beneficial effects against cancer and protective effects on the cardiovascular system. It is present in the diet, and the hepatic and duodenal sulphation might limit the bioavailability of this compound. The aim was to study the sulphation of resveratrol in the human liver and duodenum. 2. A simple and reproducible radiometric assay for resveratrol sulphation was developed. It employed 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulphate-[35S] as the sulphate donor and the rates of resveratrol sulphation (mean +/- SD, pmol/min/mg cytosolic protein) were 90 +/- 21 (liver, n = 10) and 74 +/- 60 (duodenum, n = 10, p = 0.082). 3. Resveratrol sulphotransferase followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Km (mean +/- SD; microM) was 0.63 +/- 0.03 (liver, n = 5) and 0.50 +/- 0.26 (duodenum, n = 5, p = 0.39) and Vmax (mean +/- SD, pmol/min/mg cytosolic protein) were 125 +/- 31 (liver, n = 5) and 129 +/- 85 (duodenum, n = 5, p = 0.62). 4. Resveratrol sulphation was inhibited by the flavonoid quercetin, by mefenamic acid and salicylic acid, two commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. IC50 of resveratrol sulphation for quercetin was 12 +/- 2 pM (liver) and 15 +/- 2 pM (duodenum), those for mefenamic acid were 24 +/- 3 nM (liver) and 11 +/- 0.6 nM (duodenum), and those for salicylic acid were 53 +/- 9 microM (liver) and 66 +/- 4 microM (duodenum). 5. The potent inhibition of resveratrol sulphation by quercetin, a flavonoid present in wine, fruits and vegetables, suggests that compounds present in the diet may inhibit the sulphation of resveratrol, thus improving its bioavailability."
2018,29409856,Crocin mediated amelioration of oxidative burden and inflammatory cascade suppresses diabetic nephropathy progression in diabetic rats.,"Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is one of the main complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Persistently elevated blood glucose level drives histopathological changes in renal tissues that hinder normal kidney functions. In the current study, crocin; the main bioactive constituent of Crocus sativus was investigated as a reno-protective agent against DN by virtue of its numerous pharmacological activities. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawely rats through intravenous injection of streptozocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg), DN was confirmed eight weeks post diabetes induction. Daily oral crocin for eight weeks (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced blood glucose level with a significant increase in insulin level. Moreover, crocin improved impaired kidney functions as manifested in reduction of serum creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen and proteinuria with concomitant increase in urinary creatinine clearance. Furthermore, biomarkers of cell injury and tissue necrosis like LDH activity was significantly reduced, kidney content of NOS significantly declined likewise. In addition, renal antioxidants such as SOD, GSH and serum catalase activity significantly increased with concomitant reduction of kidney MDA; biomarker of oxidative load. Kidney content of toll-like receptors 4 and IL-6 significantly declined with simultaneous suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB/p65) protein expression and immuno-staining in rat renal cortex. Furthermore, crocin inhibited progression of renal fibrosis as seen with reduction of renal hydroxyproline and collagen content, TGF-β immuno-staining and Masson's Trichrome positive tissue. Histopathologically, crocin pretreatment was associated with minimal renal damage with fewer fibrotic lesions. There was a concomitant restoration of renal tubules integrity with preservation of glomerular space area. In conclusion, crocin's ameliorative impact on DN may be attributed to its free radicals scavenging properties, its ability to enhance host antioxidant defense system and its ability to inhibit inflammatory and fibrotic cascades activation."
2016,26769504,Cheese whey: A cost-effective alternative for hyaluronic acid production by Streptococcus zooepidemicus.,"This study focuses on the optimisation of cheese whey formulated media for the production of hyaluronic acid (HA) by Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Culture media containing whey (W; 2.1g/L) or whey hydrolysate (WH; 2.4 g/L) gave the highest HA productions. Both W and WH produced high yields on protein consumed, suggesting cheese whey is a good nitrogen source for S. zooepidemicus production of HA. Polysaccharide concentrations of 4.0 g/L and 3.2g/L were produced in W and WH in a further scale-up to 5L bioreactors, confirming the suitability of the low-cost nitrogen source. Cheese whey culture media provided high molecular weight (>3000 kDa) HA products. This study revealed replacing the commercial peptone by the low-cost alternative could reduce HA production costs by up to a 70% compared to synthetic media."
2016,27468463,Effect of hydroalcoholic fruit extract of Persea americana Mill. on high fat diet induced obesity: A dose response study in rats.,"The fruits of Persea Americana Mill., commonly known as Avocado, are traditionally consumed for various health benefits including weight reduction. Here, we studied the effect of hydroalcoholic fruit extract of Persea americana (HAEPA) on high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in rats. Obesity was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by feeding HFD for 14 wk. The hypolipidemic effect was evaluated by co-administering 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body wt. of HAEPA. There was a significant increase in weight gain, body mass index (BMI), blood lipids, low density lipoproteins (LDL), lipid peroxides (LPO) and serum transaminases in HFD fed rats. HFD+HAEPA fed rats showed a significant decrease in blood lipids, LPO, liver lipids and increase in antioxidant status when compared to HFD control rats. The activity of lipid metabolic key enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and HMG CoA reductase in liver were also found to be decreased significantly in HAEPA co-administered rats. Lipoprotein lipase activity was found increased in HFD+HAEPA rats. Among the 4 doses studied, 100 mg of HAEPA/kg body wt. exhibited optimum hypolipidemic activity. Histopathological observations in liver and visceral adipose tissue added more evidence for the lipid lowering effect of HAEPA. It can be concluded that avocado fruit extract can act as hypolipidemic agent probably by modulating the activities of HMG CoA reductase and fatty acid synthase in liver."
2018,29793324,"Evaluation of the antithrombotic activity of Zhi-Xiong Capsules, a Traditional Chinese Medicinal formula, via the pathway of anti-coagulation, anti-platelet activation and anti-fibrinolysis.","Zhi-Xiong Capsules (ZXC) involving Hirudo, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Leonurus artemisia, and Pueraria lobata, is an empirical prescription used in Chinese clinics applied for treating cerebral arteriosclerosis and blood-stasis in clinic. However, the mechanism of its antithrombotic activity has not been investigated until now. The present study was designed to investigate its antithrombotic effects, the mechanism of ZXC on anti-thrombus action and to identify the main chemical composition of ZXC using HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MS. Two animal models were used to evaluate the antithrombotic effect of ZXC, the arterial thrombosis model and a venous thrombosis model. ZXC prolonged the plasma recalcification time (PRT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), the thrombin time (TT) and the prothrombin time (PT) and clearly reduced the content of fibrinogen (FIB) obviously in the arterial thrombosis model. Furthermore, it markedly suppressed the level of TXB2 and up-regulated the level of 6-keto-PGF1a. In addition, it significantly up-regulated the level of t-PA and down-regulated the level of PAI-1 (p < 0.05). These results revealed that ZXC played a vital role in the prevention of thrombosis through interacting with multiple targets, including inhibition of coagulation and platelet aggregation and increasing thrombolysis. A total of 23 compounds were identified as the main components of ZXC by HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT TOF-MS."
2017,28069066,Anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol in human coronary arterial endothelial cells via induction of autophagy: implication for the treatment of Kawasaki disease.,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile vasculitis in childhood, which is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. If untreated, KD can result in coronary aneurysms in 25% of patients, and even under intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, 10-20% of children will have IVIG resistance and increased risk of developing coronary arteritis complication. Additional therapies should be explored to decrease the incidence of coronary artery lesions and improve the prognosis in KD. Autophagy has been reported to play a critical role in a variety of heart diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) confers cardio protection during ischemia and reperfusion in rats via activation of autophagy. Serum TNF-alpha levels are elevated in KD, which might activate the endothelial cells to express intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1β.Human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAECs) were either untreated or treated by TNF-α 10 ng/ml for 2 h in the presence or absence of RSV or autophagy-related protein 16-like 1 (Atg16L1) siRNA. Total RNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, iNOS and IL-1β mRNA expressions. The involvement of autophagy proteins was investigated by Western blot.Pretreatment with resveratrol significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1, iNOS and IL-1β mRNA expression in HCAECs. Western blot revealed the enhanced autophagy proteins LC3B and Atg16L1 expression by RSV. The suppressive effects of RSV were obviously counteracted by Atg16L1 siRNA.We demonstrated RSV had anti-inflammatory effects on HCAECs via induction of autophagy. Our results suggest that resveratrol may modulate the inflammatory response of coronary artery in KD and explore the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis and alternative therapy of coronary arterial lesions in KD."
2004,15473658,Establishment of in vitro test system for the evaluation of the estrogenic activities of natural products.,"In order to evaluate estrogenic compounds in natural products, an in vitro detection system was established. For this system, the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was stably transfected using an estrogen responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid yielding MCF7/pDsCAT-ERE119-Ad2MLP cells. To test the estrogenic responsiveness of this in vitro assay system, MCF7/pDsCAT-ERE119-Ad2MLP cells were treated with various concentrations of 17beta-estradiol. Treatments of 10(-8) to 10(-12) M 17beta-estradiol revealed significant concentration dependent estrogenic activities compared with ethanol. We used in vitro assay system to detect estrogenic effects in Puerariae radix and Ginseng radix Rubra extracts. Treatment of 500 and 50 microg/ml of Puerariae radix extracts increased the transcriptional activity approximately 4- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the ethanol treatment. Treatment of 500, 50, and 5 microg/ml of Ginseng radix Rubra extracts increased the transcriptional activity approximately 3.2-, 2.7-, and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with the ethanol treatment. These observations suggest that Puerariae radix and Ginseng radix Rubra extracts have effective estrogenic actions and that they could be developed as estrogenic supplements."
1998,9836418,Computational analysis of the amino acid residue sequences of amaranth and some other proteins.,"Amaranth belongs to a nutritious class of pseudocereals. The well balanced amino acid composition of amaranth compared with those of major cereals would indicate that it deserves a quantitative study of its chemical properties. This work was undertaken to compare Amaranthus (A.) caudatus with a number of other plants on the basis of the sequences of various proteins and the composition of their alcohol-soluble protein mixture and glutelins. Alcohol-soluble proteins were extracted with 55% isopropanol (2-ProOH) + 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and glutelin fractions were obtained with borate buffer + 3% 2-ME + 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pH 10. Protein fractions were then electrophoreded on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). FASTA and TFASTA programmes were used for comparison of amino acid sequences. Dot matrix analysis and secondary structure predictions which were drawn by Plot-structure, were taken from the GCG package. Electrophoretic tests failed to indicate significant correlation between prolamins from cereals and other plants with the alcohol-soluble fractions from amaranth, proving that these proteins cannot represent the main fraction in amaranth. On the other hand, glutelins shared some common electrophoretic bands with other cereals and showed some identity by SDS-PAGE. Amino acid sequences of A. caudatus (100% identity) had degrees of similarity in the range of 71.4 to 52.2% with rice, garden pea, jobs' tears, maize, and yam. Rice glutelin had similarity in the range of 93.3% to 44.8% with oats, soybean, and pea. Secondary structures of A. caudatus (using conservative amino acid replacement), jobs' tears and rice glutelins, oat globulin, and pea legumin sequences were predicted. Some relationship was shown among electrophoretic patterns of alcohol-soluble proteins and glutelins of A. caudatus."
2015,26343955,"α- and γ-mangostin cause shape changes, inhibit aggregation and induce cytolysis of rat platelets.","α- and γ-mangostin are natural xanthones isolated from mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) and the major constituents responsible for the plant's diverse biological activities. In this study, the effects of α- and γ-mangostin on platelets were investigated based on their possible antiplatelet activity. Treatment of isolated platelets with α-mangostin resulted in attenuation of platelet aggregatory response to collagen, thrombin or ADP. Such antiaggregatory effects were concentration-dependent in ranges of 1-10 μM. Interestingly, α-mangostin alone induced shape changes in platelets at the same concentration, and higher levels, 25 and 50 μM caused platelet lysis. Similarly, γ-mangostin induced shape changes and inhibited aggregation at 2.5-25 μM, while 50 and 100 μM γ-mangostin exhibited cytotoxicity. Platelet shape change induced by α- and γ-mangostin was accompanied by increases in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. MLC phosphorylation and subsequent shape changes were prevented by pretreatment with Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632, but not by the intracellular Ca(2+) chelating with BAPTA-AM and extracellular Ca(2+) removal. Cytolysis by both α- and γ-mangostin was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Taken together, α- and γ-mangostin have differential effects on platelets depending on their concentration, which includes inducing shape change, inhibiting aggregation and causing cytolysis. Platelet shape change is attributed to stimulation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, while platelet lysis is presumably mediated by extracellular Ca(2+) influx. These results suggest that mangosteen consumption may have potential platelet effects, although the in vivo or clinical consequences have yet to be assessed."
2013,23870903,Comparison of a silver nanoparticle-based method and the modified spectrophotometric methods for assessing antioxidant capacity of rapeseed varieties.,"The antioxidant capacity of 15 rapeseed varieties was determined by the proposed silver nanoparticle-based (AgNP) method and three modified assays: ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Folin-Ciocalteu reducing capacity (FC). The average antioxidant capacities of the studied rapeseed cultivars ranged between 5261-9462, 3708-7112, 18864-31245 and 5816-9937 μmol sinapic acid (SA)/100g for AgNP, FRAP, DPPH and FC methods, respectively. There are significant, positive correlations between antioxidant capacities of the studied rapeseed cultivars determined by four analytical methods (r=0.5971-0.9149, p<0.05). The comparable precision for the proposed AgNP method (RSD=1.4-4.4%) and the modified FRAP, DPPH and FC methods (RSD=1.0-4.4%, 0.7-2.1% and 0.8-3.6%, respectively), demonstrate the benefit of the AgNP method in the routine analysis of antioxidant capacity of rapeseed cultivars. The principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used for discrimination the quality of the studied rapeseed varieties based on their antioxidant potential determined by different analytical methods. Three main groups were identified by HCA, while the classification and characterisation of rapeseed varieties within each of these groups were obtained from PCA. The chemometric analyses demonstrated that, rapeseed variety S13 had the highest antioxidant capacity, thus this cultivar should be considered as the richest source of natural antioxidants."
2019,30708968,Potential of Thirteen Urban Greening Plants to Capture Particulate Matter on Leaf Surfaces across Three Levels of Ambient Atmospheric Pollution.,"The potential of urban greening plants to capture particulate matter (PM) from the ambient atmosphere is contingent on interactions between the level of pollution and leaf surfaces. For this study, thirteen plant species were investigated to quantify their capacity of PM accumulation under three atmospheric environments, that is, industrial, traffic and university campus (control), in Kunming City (Southwest China). The sampled sites represented different pollution levels (that is, high pollution, slight pollution and clean air, respectively). The plant species differed in their accumulation of PM by six- to eight-fold across the three sites. Magnolia grandiflora was the most efficient evergreen tree species, whereas Platanus acerifolia had the highest capture of PM among deciduous trees. The accumulation capacity of the same species varied with the degree of pollution. For example, Osmanthus fragrans, Loropetalum chinense and Cinnamomum japonicum were highly efficient for the capture of PM in the traffic and university campus areas; however, they exhibited medium accumulation in the industrial area. Prunus majestica demonstrated an intermediate accumulation capacity in the industrial area, but was low in the traffic and university campus areas. The capturing capacity of the same genus was also different among the different levels of pollution. For example, C. japonicum had a 2.9⁻4.2-times higher PM accumulation than did C. camphora across the three sites. There were significant differences in leaf surface area, stomata density/length, guard cell area, and trichome density/length among these species. The species-specific efficacy of PM capture was primarily contributed to by leaf size and surface roughness, stomata density, and trichome length. In particular, hairy-leaf leaves with medium stomatal density exhibited higher PM capture. Therefore, leaf micromorphology, leaf size and longevity appeared to be significant predictive factors for the accumulation of PM, which may aid in the selection of greening plant species for the remediation of pollutants in urban areas."
,23344089,Effects of Zingiber officinale on the plasma pharmacokinetics and lung penetrations of ciprofloxacin and isoniazid.,"The study was carried out to determine the effect of ginger on the plasma pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and Isoniazid in a rat model in phase 1. The effects of the herb on the penetration of ciproflacin and Isoniazid into the lung tissues were also determined in phase 2. In phase 1, Albino rats of both sexes (n = 20) were divided into 4 groups of 5 rats per group. Two groups received oral ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg) and isoniazid (15 mg/kg). Other groups were fed with ginger (5 mg/kg) for 10 days followed by the drug administration on the 11th day. Blood samples were collected from each group at 0-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 5-, 8-, 12-, and 24-hour intervals. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were determined by a spectrophotometric method and the pharmacokinetic parameters determined using noncompartmental method as implemented in the winNonlin program. In phase 2, where the effects of the herb on the penetration of the drugs were determined, the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and isoniazid attained in the lung fluid of rats in the presence and absence of the herb were compared after a single oral dose of the drugs used in the same dose range as in phase 1. In the first phase, treatment with ginger significantly increased the area under the concentration-time curve of ciprofloxacin, whereas Vz and Cl were decreased. Ginger significantly decreased the area under the concentration-time curve of isoniazid, whereas Vz and Cl were increased. Ginger enhanced the penetration of ciprofloxacin and Isoniazid into the lung tissues; however, their rates of penetration were delayed. "
1983,6600389,Acute tumor lysis in T-cell leukemia induced by amsacrine.,The acridine orange derivative amsacrine (National Services Center No. 249992) was used to treat a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A 17-year-old boy had a tumor lysis syndrome after a single 200 mg/sq m dose of amsacrine. This was followed by a prolonged period of marrow hypoplasia leading to death from infection. Review of the literature and our own experience would suggest that T-cell ALL may be exquisitely sensitive to amsacrine.
2011,20846518,1-Methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate; a potent genotoxicant in bacterial and mammalian cells: Mechanisms of bioactivation.,"1-Methoxy-3-indolylmethyl (1-MIM) glucosinolate, contained in many Brassica vegetables, is strongly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 when activated by myrosinase. Here, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of two breakdown products, 1-MIM nitrile and 1-MIM alcohol. 1-MIM nitrile was not mutagenic and 1-MIM alcohol showed low direct mutagenicity in TA100, indicating that other breakdown products mediated the mutagenicity of 1-MIM glucosinoate/myrosinase in this strain. However, 1-MIM alcohol was strongly mutagenic to a TA100-derived strain expressing human sulphotransferase SULT1A1. Likewise, 1-MIM glucosinolate (with myrosinase) showed 10 times higher mutagenic activity in TA100-SULT1A1 than in strain TA100. Identical adducts, N(2)-(1-MIM)-dG and N(6)-(1-MIM)-dA, were detected in both strains, but the levels were higher in TA100-hSULT1A1. A similar influence of SULT1A1 was observed in recombinant V79-hSULT1A1 cells compared to parental SULT-deficient Chinese hamster V79 cells. 1-MIM glucosinolate (with myrosinase) as well as 1-MIM alcohol induced sister chromatid exchange in both cell lines, but with clearly higher efficiency in V79-hSULT1A1 cells. Gene mutation assays were conducted at the HPRT locus with 1-MIM alcohol in V79-hSULT1A1 cells, and with 1-MIM glucosinolate/myrosinase in V79 parental cells. In both cases, the result was clearly positive. Thus, 1-MIM glucosinolate is mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cells via at least two different metabolites."
2011,25212134,Protein-binding and antioxidant potential of phenolics of mangosteen fruit (Garcinia mangostana).,"Phenolics were extracted from mangosteen fruit parts with 70% (v/v) aqueous acetone. The yield of crude extracts of phenolics (CP) ranged from 5.8% to 7.9%. The total phenolics (TPH) content ranged from 9.3mg to over 250mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of extract in the edible aril and skin, respectively. The formation of phenolic-protein complexes was assayed by both the dye-labelled bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the fluorescence quenching methods. Phenolics from peel and rind displayed a strong protein-precipitating potential. On the other hand, phenolics from edible aril exhibited greater affinity for BSA, as determined by the fluorescence quenching assay. The static quenching was the dominant mode of quenching of BSA fluorescence by mangosteen fruit phenolics. Mangosteen phenolics occupied two binding sites on BSA molecules located most likely in or near both tryptophan residues in the BSA molecule acting as an intrinsic fluorescence probe. "
2017,28202081,Use of ethanol extracts of Terminalia chebula to prevent periodontal disease induced by dental plaque bacteria.,"The fruit of the Terminalia chebula tree has been widely used for the treatment of various disorders. Its anti-diabetic, anti-mutagenic, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral effects have been studied. Dental plaque bacteria (DPB) are intimately associated with gingivitis and periodontitis. In the quest for materials that will prove useful in the treatment and prevention of periodontal disease, we investigated the preventive effects of an ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula (EETC) on DPB-induced inflammation and bone resorption.The anti-bacterial effect of EETC was analyzed using the disc diffusion method. The anti-inflammatory effect of EETC was determined by molecular biological analysis of the DPB-mediated culture cells. Prevention of osteoclastic bone resorption by EETC was explored using osteoclast formation and pit formation assays.EETC suppressed the growth of oral bacteria and reduced the induction of inflammatory cytokines and proteases, abolishing the expression of PGE2 and COX-2 and inhibiting matrix damage. By stimulating the DPB-derived lipopolysaccharides, EETC inhibited both osteoclast formation in osteoclast precursors and RANKL expression in osteoblasts, thereby contributing to the prevention of bone resorption.EETC may be a beneficial supplement to help prevent DPB-mediated periodontal disease."
2017,28802239,Synergistic antinociceptive interaction of Syzygium aromaticum or Rosmarinus officinalis coadministered with ketorolac in rats.,"Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M. Perry (Mirtaceae) and Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae) are both medicinal plants used for centuries to alleviate pain. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the therapeutic potential utility of herb-drug association of S. aromaticum essential oil or R. officinalis ethanolic extract coadministered with ketorolac. Antinociceptive pharmacological interaction was investigated by an isbolographic study using the formalin test in rats. Both alone and in combination with ketorolac; S. aromaticum and R. officinalis produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive response. To plot the isobologram, we used the effective dose 50 of each one component in a fixed 1:1 ratio. The isobolographic analysis showed that, in both combinations, ketorolac plus essential oil S. aromaticum and ketorolac plus ethanolic extract R. officinalis, the experimental value (Zexp) was lower than the theoretical value (Zadd). In addition, this study shows that eugenol, a metabolite present in S. aromaticum, and ursolic acid, a metabolite present in R. officinalis, also synergized the antinociceptive effect of ketorolac. While, the oleanolic acid present in both medicinal species did not show a synergistic antinociceptive effect in combination with ketorolac. No adverse effects were observed with these herb-drug interactions. These findings suggest that essential oil S. aromaticum and ethanolic extract R. officinalis could be useful in combination with ketorolac for the treatment of inflammatory pain."
2015,25660853,Improved sample preparation for GC-MS-SIM analysis of ethyl carbamate in wine.,"An improved sample preparation procedure for analysis of carcinogenic ethyl carbamate (EC) in wine by GC-MS-SIM is proposed. Differences over AOAC reference procedure were: (1) use of EC-d5 as internal standard instead of less similar propyl carbamate; (2) extraction by diethyl ether instead of more toxic dichloromethane, and (3) concentration by vacuum automated parallel evaporation instead of more time and work consuming rotary evaporation. Mean recovery was 104.4%, intraday precision was 6.7% (3.4 μg L(-)(1)) and 1.7% (88.5 μg L(-)(1)), regression coefficient was 0.999 in the linear working range of 3-89 μg L(-)(1), and limits of detection and quantification were 0.4 and 1.2 μg L(-)(1). Applicability was demonstrated by analysis (in triplicate) of 5 wine samples. EC concentration ranged from 5.2 ± 0.2 to 29.4 ± 1.5 μg L(-)(1). The analytical method is selective, accurate, repeatable, linear, and has similar method performance as the reference method along with the several mentioned advantages."
2012,22705420,An original discovery: selenium deficiency and Keshan disease (an endemic heart disease).,"This is a review article telling a 50-years old story about the studies on selenium deficiency and Keshan disease in China, an endemic heart disease with high case-fatality, as an example of translational research. Extensive cross-sectional epidemiological studies showed that low selenium concentrations in cereal grains and low selenium status of local residents were associated with the occurrence of Keshan disease. Several large population based intervention trials using oral administration of sodium selenite tablets showed significant reduction of Keshan disease incidence. Based on the above evidence, it was concluded that selenium deficiency is the major cause of Keshan disease, although other etiological factors could not be ruled out. The implications of the findings include: provided critical scientific evidence for selenium being an essential trace element for humans; as scientific basis for identifying minimum requirement and RDA/RNI for selenium; and as solid reference for the formulation of effective preventive measures for Keshan disease in China."
2008,19067676,Treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone increases peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of mitochondria from cerebral cortex in D-galactose-induced aged rats.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) could regulate the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of mitochondria in cerebral cortex. The rats were divided into five groups. Those, in the vehicle-physiological or senescent group, received physiological or d-galactose (subcutaneously) once a day. Rats, in the vehicle-dimethyl sulfoxide- or DHEA-treated senescent group, received 2% of dimethyl sulfoxide or DHEA (intraperitoneally) every other day besides D-galactose (subcutaneously) once a day. Rats in the DHEA-treated normal group received physiological once a day and DHEA every other day. After 8-week, spatial learning was assessed for 5 days by water maze methods. Following behavioural testing, the cerebral cortex mitochondria were purified for PK11195 binding analysis. When compared to the respective vehicle, D-galactose alone induced a significant impairment in water maze performance accompanied by a reduction (30.7%) in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density of mitochondria, and DHEA displayed a significant enhancement in learning memory accompanied by the elevation (18.3%) of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density but not affinity in senescent rats. DHEA showed insignificant effects on both learning/memory ability and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in normal rats when compared to physiological saline. These results suggest that chronic treatment with DHEA enhance cognitive function and increase peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in cerebral cortex mitochondria in middle-aged senescent rats."
2008,18826865,Influence of grape juice and orange juice on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem in healthy human male subjects.,"The objective was to study the effect of grape juice and orange juice on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of diltiazem in healthy human volunteers.The study design was open-label, balanced, randomized, 3-period, single-dose and crossover. A group of 12 healthy, adult, male human volunteers received a single oral dose of diltiazem 180 mg extended release capsule on three different occasions: with 200 ml of water, with 200 ml of grape juice and with 200 ml of orange juice in random order. A washout period of 7 days was kept between each study period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 h post dose and assayed for diltiazem using a specific and validated HPLC method. Blood pressure (BP) and ECG measurements were done at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 h post dose. Analysis of variance was carried out using logarithmic transformations of AUC and Cmax as well as nontransformed tmax.No significant change was observed in heart rate and BP. The median tmax was identical in all three occasions. The 90% CI of the Cmax ratios for orange juice/water were 104.59 - 114.86 and for grape juice/water were 93.91 - 103.13. Similarly, the 90% CI of the AUC0-inf ratios for orange juice and grape juice vs. water were 103.68 - 119.83 and 88.56 - 104.06, respectively. Since these values fall within the bioequivalence criteria of 80 - 120% limits, our study demonstrates absence of interaction of diltiazem with grape juice or orange juice.There is no significant influence of grape juice or orange juice on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem."
2014,25064341,Protective effect of mangiferin against lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive and anxiety-like behaviour in mice.,"Numerous studies have demonstrated that inflammation, oxidative stress and altered level of neurotrophins are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive illness. Mangiferin, a C-glucosylxanthone is abundant in the stem and bark of Mangifera indica L. The compound has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of mangiferin pretreatment on lipopolysaccharide-induced increased proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and neurobehavioural abnormalities. Mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (0.83 mg/kg, i.p.) after 14 days of mangiferin (20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) pretreatment. Mangiferin pretreatment significantly ameliorated the anxiety-like behaviour as evident from the results of an elevated plus maze, light-dark box and open field test. Mangiferin pretreatment also improved the anhedonic behaviour as revealed by sucrose preference test and increased social interaction time. It also prevented the lipopolysaccharide-evoked depressive-like effect by reducing the immobility time in forced swim and tail suspension test. Lipopolysaccharide-induced elevated oxidative stress was decreased with mangiferin pretreatment due to its potential to increase reduced glutathione concentration, Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity and decrease lipid peroxidation and nitrite level in the hippocampus as well as in the prefrontal cortex. Mangiferin pretreatment also attenuated neuroinflammation by reducing the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) level in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that mangiferin possessed antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties due to its ability to attenuate IL-1β level and oxidative stress evoked by intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide. Mangiferin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of depressive and anxiety illness."
2013,23561213,Diversity of (dihydro) hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates in Colombian potato tubers.,"In potato tuber, caffeic acid (the predominant hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA)), its conjugates (HCAcs; i.e. chlorogenic acid (ChA), crypto-ChA, and neo-ChA), and anthocyanin-linked HCAs have been extensively described in the literature. In contrast, only little information is available on the occurrence of other HCAcs and didydrohydroxycinnamic acid conjugates (DHCAcs). Fifteen Colombian potato cultivars were screened for these less commonly described conjugates by reversed-phase ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector and a heated electrospray ionisation mass spectrometer. A total of 62 HCAs/HCAcs/DHCAcs were found in extracts from peel and flesh. Among them, only twelve compounds were common to all cultivars in both peel and flesh. The less commonly described compounds accounted for 7.1-20.1% w/w of the total amount of HCAs/HCAcs/DHCAcs in whole tubers, highlighting their contribution to the total phenolic profile of potato tubers. Among all cultivars, the abundance (mg/100 g DW whole tuber) of neo-ChA (0.8-7.4) ranged in similar quantities as the less commonly reported feruloyl octopamine (1.2-5.2), 5-O-feruloyl quinic acid (0.1-7.5), cis-ChA (1.1-2.2), caffeoyl putrescine (0.6-2.5), sinapoyl hexose (0.1-1.8), N(1),N(14)-bis-(dihydrocaffeoyl) spermine (0.2-1.7), N(1),N(10)-bis-(dihydrocaffeoyl) spermidine (1.1-2.6), and N(1),N(5),N(14)-tris-(dihydrocaffeoyl) spermine (trace - 11.1)."
2013,23438228,Protective effect of dietary tender cluster beans (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) in the gastrointestinal tract of experimental rats.,"In this study, the gastrointestinal protective effect of soluble, dietary fiber-rich tender cluster beans, with respect to the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration of antioxidant molecules, was examined in Wistar rats. Dietary intervention with tender cluster beans (15% freeze-dried powder in the diet for 8 weeks) significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, and GPX) and the concentrations of antioxidant molecules in both gastric and intestinal mucosa. Further, in combination with capsaicin (0.01%), the beneficial effect was even higher. There is a strong indication that tender cluster beans offer a significant gastroprotective effect, and a much greater effect when combined with capsaicin in terms of increased antioxidant status. In a separate study, these dietary components were found to alleviate the diminished activities of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant molecules in gastric and intestinal mucosa under conditions of ethanol-induced oxidative stress. The gastroprotective effect of the cluster bean was also reflected in its positive effect on gastric mucosal glycoproteins, resulting in a lowering of mucosal injury. Incidentally, the serum and liver also showed an elevated antioxidant status, thus suggesting desirable lowered oxidative stress results when tender cluster beans are consumed."
2016,26827941,Resveratrol inhibits inflammatory signaling implicated in ionizing radiation-induced premature ovarian failure through antagonistic crosstalk between silencing information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1).,"This study hypothesized that resveratrol, a silencing information regulator 1 (SIRT1) activator, would counteract the inflammatory signaling associated with radiotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure (POF). Immature female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single dose of γ-radiation to induce POF and treated with resveratrol (25mg/kg) once daily for two weeks before and three days post irradiation. Resveratrol preserves the entire ovarian follicle pool manifested by increasing serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. Radiation triggered inflammatory process in the ovary through enhanced NF-κB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 expression which convinced the expression of inflammatory markers including IL-6, IL-8, and visfatin mRNA levels, as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression with a concomitant reduction in IL-10 mRNA levels. Resveratrol significantly counteracted the effect of radiation and upregulated the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and SIRT1. Resveratrol-activated SIRT1 expression was associated with inhibition of PARP-1 and NF-κB expression-mediated inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that resveratrol restored ovarian function through increasing AMH levels, and diminishing ovarian inflammation, predominantly via upregulation of PPAR-γ and SIRT1 expression leading to inhibition of NF-κB provoked inflammatory cytokines.

1998,9587140,"Physiologic function of the Wilson disease gene product, ATP7B.","The genes responsible for Wilson disease and Menkes syndrome have been cloned and identified as copper ATPases. These enzymes form part of a large family of transporters, the P-type ATPases. Although copper ATPases share strong structural similarities with these other pumps, comparatively little is known about their physiologic function. In this review, we examine data relating to the Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, in the liver. We present evidence suggesting that ATP7B is located intracellularly, together with data suggesting that, at least in part, ATP7B may also be found on the canalicular membrane. We also examine the form of copper that the transporter recognizes. We then review data on the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, a model for Wilson disease, and discuss what effect the Wilson disease mutation has on copper transport. Finally, we conclude that, although we have made major advances in our understanding of copper metabolism in the liver, there are still many questions awaiting answers."
2019,30955619,Mechanisms non-enzymatic browning in orange juice during storage.,"The role of Reactive Carbonyl Species (RCS) derived from the Maillard reaction and ascorbic acid degradation on brown color formation was investigated in orange juice during storage. Eight RCS were monitored in aseptic juice over an 8-week period under refrigerated (4 °C) and accelerated conditions (35 °C). Significant changes in RCS concentrations were reported and positively correlated with color formation. Recombination experiments demonstrated the significant role of 3-deoxyglucosone and acetol on color formation as well as their interactions with glyoxal and methylglyoxal that lead to an increase in browning. Isotopic enrichment techniques further identified fructose as the main precursor of RCS, indicating the important role of Maillard reaction as a mechanism of non-enzymatic browning during orange juice storage. Finally, among the amino acids, tryptophan and glutamine showed the largest percentage losses in orange juice during storage and were reported to significantly impact the RCS composition and color formation."
2016,27452119,"Minimal short-term effect of dietary 2'-fucosyllactose on bacterial colonisation, intestinal function and necrotising enterocolitis in preterm pigs.","Human milk decreases the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a severe gastrointestinal disease that occurs in 5-10 % of preterm infants. The prebiotic and immune-modulatory effects of milk oligosaccharides may contribute to this protection. Preterm pigs were used to test whether infant formula enriched with α1,2-fucosyllactose (2'-FL, the most abundant oligosaccharide in human milk) would benefit gut microbial colonisation and NEC resistance after preterm birth. Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were fed formula (Controls, n 17) or formula with 5 g/l 2'-FL (2'-FL, n 16) for 5 d; eight 2'-FL pigs (50 %) and twelve Controls (71 %) developed NEC, with no difference in lesion scores (P=0·35); 2'-FL pigs tended to have less anaerobic bacteria in caecal contents (P=0·22), but no difference in gut microbiota between groups were observed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and 454 pyrosequencing. Abundant α1,2-fucose was detected in the intestine with no difference between groups, and intestinal structure (villus height, permeability) and digestive function (hexose absorption, brush border enzyme activities) were not affected by 2'-FL. Formula enrichment with 2'-FL does not affect gut microbiology, digestive function or NEC sensitivity in pigs within the first few days after preterm birth. Milk 2'-FL may not be critical in the immediate postnatal period of preterm neonates when gut colonisation and intestinal immunity are still immature."
2003,12623757,"CYP2D6-mediated catalysis of tamoxifen aromatic hydroxylation with an NIH shift: similar hydroxylation mechanism in chicken, rat and human liver microsomes.","1. 4-Tritiated-tamoxifen (4-[(3)H]-tamoxifen) and 4-deuterated-tamoxifen (4-[(2)H]-tamoxifen) were synthesized to examine tamoxifen metabolism by human P450 (CYP) forms and also for the possibility of determining tamoxifen-4-hydroxylation in humans in vivo. 2. Liver microsomes from several species and cDNA-expressed human P450s were incubated with 4-[(3)H]-tamoxifen and the reaction monitored by assaying 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-tam) and (3)H(2)O formed. However, tamoxifen-4-hydroxylation did not generate stoichiometric amounts of (3)H(2)O and the expected unlabelled 4-OH-tam but instead yielded radiolabelled 4-OH-tam, apparently from [(3)H]-migration to the ortho-position, referred to as the NIH shift. 3. CYP2D6 was the prime catalyst of tam-4-hydroxylation, whereas CYP2B6, 2C9 and 2C19 yielded only low levels of 4-OH-tam; nevertheless, in all cases the 4-OH-tam was radioactive, apparently resulting from reactions involving an NIH shift. 4. Chicken liver microsomal preparation, being catalytically the most active in tamoxifen-4-hydroxylation, was incubated with deuterated tamoxifen (4-[(2)H]-tamoxifen) in order to determine whether an NIH shift occurs. Ion-trap mass-spectrometry of the HPLC-purified 4-OH-tam, from that incubation, indicated about 60% of [(2)H]-retention in 4-OH-tam, signifying an NIH shift. These findings indicate that the aromatic hydroxylation of tamoxifen does not entail hydroxyl insertion with an Sn2-displacement of hydrogen or a hydrogen isotope ((2)H or (3)H), but apparently involves epoxidation followed by migration of the (3)H, (2)H or (1)H to the ortho-position, and dissociation of the (1)H in preference to (3)H or (2)H, i.e. retention of the hydrogen isotope appears to be related to the bond strengths: C-(3)H>C-(2)H>C-(1)H."
2015,25129652,Steroid replacement in primary adrenal failure does not appear to affect circulating adipokines.,"Despite continuous efforts for an optimal steroid replacement, recent observations suggest increased cardiometabolic risk and related mortality in primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). Adipokines are peptides from the adipose tissue, markers of cardiometabolic dysfunction. This study was aimed to evaluate serum levels of adipokines: leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in PAI during conventional steroid substitution. The analysis comprised 63 patients (mean age 42.7 ± 14.1 years) and 63 healthy controls. Serum adipokines, lipid profile, and plasma glucose were assessed in both cohorts. ACTH, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, DHEA-S, cortisol and 24 h urinary free cortisol were determined in PAI. Body mass composition was analyzed by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Mean BMI in the control group was 24.1 ± 3.9 kg/m(2) and 23.7 ± 3.9 kg/m(2) in the PAI cohort. Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were similar in both groups, whereas resistin appeared significantly lower among affected subjects (p = 0.0002). Its levels were weakly correlated with HOMA-IR (p = 0.048). Leptin was independently correlated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, BMI, and body fat (p < 0.001). At the multiple regression analysis only weight (p = 0.017), total and HDL cholesterol (p < 0.001) appeared significant predictors of adiponectin level. No adipokine correlations with serum cortisol or daily hydrocortisone dose were found. Patients receiving DHEA substitution displayed lower leptin and adiponectin levels (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our study did not provide evidence of an adverse adipokine profile in patients with PAI under conventional glucocorticoid replacement. Serum adipokines in treated PAI follow similar correlations to those reported in healthy subjects. Further prospective studies are warranted to verify and explain plausible excess of cardiovascular mortality in PAI."
2011,22150656,Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update.,"The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate]), and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration. For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones."
2011,21086553,Relationships between the transcriptome and physiological indicators of reproduction in female rainbow trout over an annual cycle.,"Normal transcriptomic patterns along the brain-pituitary-gonad-liver (BPGL) axis should be better characterized if endocrine-disrupting compound-induced changes in gene expression are to be understood. Female rainbow trout were studied over a complete year-long reproductive cycle. Tissue samples from pituitary, ovary, and liver were collected for microarray analysis using the 16K Genomic Research on Atlantic Salmon Project (GRASP) microarray and for quantitative polymerase chain reaction measures of estrogen receptor (ER) isoform messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Plasma was collected to determine levels of circulating estradiol-17β (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). As an a priori hypothesis, changes in gene expression were correlated to either circulating levels of E2, FSH, and LH, or ER mRNAs quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In the liver, most transcriptomic patterns correlated to levels of either E2, LH, or ERs. Fewer ovarian transcripts could be correlated to levels of E2, ERα, or FSH. No significant associations were obvious in the pituitary. As a post hoc hypothesis, changes in transcript abundance were compared with microarray features with known roles in gonadal maturation. Many altered transcripts in the ovary correlated to transcript levels of estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 8 or 17 B HSD12, or to glycoprotein alpha chain 1 or 2. In the pituitary, genes involved with the growth axis (e.g., growth hormone, insulin-related growth factor binding protein) correlated with the most transcripts. These results suggest that transcriptional networks along the BPGL axis may be regulated by factors other than circulating steroid hormones."
2012,23126282,Antiangiogenesis and antioxidant activity of ethanol extracts of Pithecellobium jiringa.,"Angiogenesis plays a critical role in embryonic development and various physiological processes. However, excessive angiogenesis is associated with several pathological conditions including cancer. Pithecellobium jiringa (Jack) Prain is a traditional medicinal plant from the family Leguminosae. It is native to the Southeast Asia, where it has been used traditionally for treatment of various ailments such as hypertension and diabetes. The present work is aimed to study antioxidant and antiangiogenesis activities of P. jiringa ethanol extracts.P. jiringa fruit rinds were extracted with ethanol and 50% ethanol. The antioxidant property was analysed using, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical scavenging assay. Phytochemical analysis was performed using thin layer chromatography and colorimetric methods. Then, cell growth inhibition was studied against a panel of human cell lines by MTT test. In vitro inhibition of angiogenesis was studied by the following assays: isolated rat aortic rings cell viability, colony formation, endothelial cell migration, endothelial tube formation on matrigel, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by endothelial cells. In vivo antiangiogenesis effect was studied by utilising fertilised chick embryos assay. The results were statistically analysed by analysis of variance.Ethanolic and 50% hydro-ethanolic extracts showed relatively high concentration of total phenolics associated with potent antioxidant activity. The rat aortic rings study conducted showed potent inhibition of the microvessels outgrowth with IC50s 5.27 ± 0.81 μg/ml (ethanolic) and 4.45 ± 0.63 μg/ml (50% hydro-ethanolic). Both extracts arrested the growth of human endothelial cells via down-regulation of VEGF expression, leading to inhibition of other angiogenesis cascades including migration of endothelial cells, and formation of capillary network on matrigel matrix. The extracts also inhibited the neovascularisation of chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane.P. jiringa extracts inhibit angiogenesis by blocking the VEGF expression thus inhibiting endothelial cells proliferation, migration and differentiation most likely due to presence of the antioxidant phenolics."
2014,25264278,Wogonin reverses multi-drug resistance of human myelogenous leukemia K562/A02 cells via downregulation of MRP1 expression by inhibiting Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.,"Constitutive NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation has been recently reported to play a pivotal role in enhancing cell survival and resistance to anticancer drugs in many tumors. Previously, much effort has been devoted to the investigation of blocking Nrf2 function in cultured cells and cancer tissues, but few researches have been undertaken to evaluate the precise mechanism of flavonoids-induced sensitivity by inhibiting Nrf2. In this study, we investigated the reversal effect of Wogonin, a flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, in resistant human myelogenous leukemia. Data indicated that Wogonin had strong reversal potency by inhibiting functional activity and expression of MRP1 at both protein and mRNA in adriamycin (ADR)-induced resistant human myelogenous leukemia K562/A02 cells. Consequently, the inhibition of MRP1 by Wogonin was dependent on Nrf2 through the decreased binding ability of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element (ARE). Further research revealed Wogonin modulated Nrf2 through the reduction of Nrf2mRNA at transcriptional processes rather than RNA degradation, which is regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, DNA-PKcs was found to be involved in the Wogonin-induced downregulation of Nrf2 mRNA at transcriptional levels. In summary, these results clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of using Wogonin via inhibiting Nrf2 to combat chemoresistance and suggested that Wogonin can be developed into an efficient natural sensitizer for resistant human myelogenous leukemia.

2008,18827359,Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) are involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. During the course of a screening program to identify natural anti-inflammatory substances, we isolated the compound 2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one (APO) from an extract of the edible brown mushroom Agaricus bisporus IMBACH. APO inhibited NO production by mouse peritoneal macrophages in response to the pro-inflammatory stimuli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-gamma (LPS/IFN-gamma) at low concentrations (IC(50)=1.5 microM) through reduced inducible NO synthase protein expression. PGE(2) production by LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages was inhibited by APO at much lower concentrations (IC(50)=0.27 microM) than those required for the inhibition of NO production. Mechanistic analysis showed that APO inhibited both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities with almost equal selectivity. Secretion of NO and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by IFN-gamma-activated RAW264.7 cells, a murine macrophage-like cell line, was also dose-dependently reduced by APO. Furthermore, APO increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 by antigen-stimulated T cells and promoted the polarization of CD4(+) Th cells toward the anti-inflammatory Th2 phenotype at equimolar concentrations that inhibited NO production. Our results suggested that APO induced polarization toward the Th2 subset, at least in part through the down-regulation of IL-12 production. Thus, APO appears to have potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties that may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T cell-mediated inflammatory autoimmune diseases as well as for bacteria-induced chronic-inflammatory diseases."
2011,22125471,Antibacterial activities of Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extracts.,"The antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, chloroform, and hexane extracts of the leaves of Himalayan gymnospermous plant Ginkgo biloba L. was assessed against five animal and plant pathogenic strains (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Xanthomonas phaseoli) employing disc-diffusion and broth-dilution assays. The methanol extract showed the highest activity (zone of inhibition of 15-21 mm) followed by ethanol (14-19 mm), chloroform (15-20 mm), and hexane (14-19 mm) extracts at 250 μg/mL. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 7.8 μg/mL was found for the methanol extract against most of the pathogens tested."
2017,28412649,Proinflammatory effects of diesel exhaust particles from moderate blend concentrations of 1st and 2nd generation biodiesel in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells-The FuelHealth project.,"Biodiesel fuel fuels are introduced at an increasing extent as a more carbon-neutral alternative to reduce CO2-emissions, compared to conventional diesel fuel. In the present study we have investigated the impact of increasing the use of 1st generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel from current 7% blend (B7) to 20% blend (B20), or by increasing the biodiesel content by adding 2nd generation hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) based biodiesel (SHB; Synthetic Hydrocarbon Biofuel) on toxicity of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) in an in vitro system. Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were exposed for 4 and 20h to DEP from B7, B20 and SHB at different concentrations, and examined for effects on gene expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), CXCL8 (IL-8), CYP1A1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The results show that both B20 and SHB were more potent inducers of IL-6 expression compared to B7. Only B20 induced statistically significant increases in CXCL8 expression. By comparison the rank order of potency to induce CYP1A1 was SHB>B7>B20. No statistically significant difference were observed form HO-1 expression, suggesting that the differences in cytokine responses were not due to oxidative stress. The results show that even moderate increases in biodiesel blends, from 7% to 20%, may increase the proinflammatory potential of emitted DEP in BEAS-2B cells. This effect was observed for both addition of 1st generation FAME and 2nd generation HVO biodiesel."
2004,15211327,Statins as the cornerstone of drug therapy for dyslipidemia: monotherapy and combination therapy options.,Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.
2017,28143472,Anti-inflammatory potential of Capparis spinosa L. in vivo in mice through inhibition of cell infiltration and cytokine gene expression.,"Several chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by inappropriate CD4+ T cell response. In the present study, we assessed the ability of Capparis spinosa L. (CS) preparation to orientate, in vivo, the immune response mediated by CD4+ T cells towards an anti-inflammatory response.The in vivo study was carried out by using the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model in Swiss mice. Then we performed a histological analysis followed by molecular study by using real time RT-PCR. We also realized a phytochemical screening and a liquid-liquid separation of CS preparation.Our study allowed us to detect a significantly reduced edema in mice treated with CS preparations relative to control. CS effect was dose dependent, statistically similar to that observed with indomethacin, independent of the plant genotype and of the period of treatment. Furthermore, our histology studies revealed that CS induced a significant decrease in immune cell infiltration, in vasodilatation and in dermis thickness in the inflammatory site. Interestingly, we showed that CS operated by inhibiting cytokine gene expression including IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-4. Besides, phytochemical screening of CS extract showed the presence of several chemical families such as saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids. One (hexane fraction) out of the three distinct prepared fractions, exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect similar to that of the raw preparation, and would likely contain the bioactive(s) molecule(s).Altogether, our data indicate that CS regulates inflammation induced in vivo in mice and thus could be a source of anti-inflammatory molecules, which could be used in some T lymphocyte-dependent inflammatory diseases."
2007,17848734,Mimosine mitigates oxidative stress in selenium deficient seedlings of Vigna radiata--Part I: Restoration of mitochondrial function.,"Mimosine, a non-protein plant amino acid found in Mimosa pudica and certain species of Leucaena, was beneficial for the growth of seedlings of Vigna radiata germinated under selenium-deficient stressed condition (-Se stressed) despite the recognized toxicity of the allelochemical. Exposure of mimosine at 0.1 mM (Mim-0.1) promoted the growth of the seedlings and significantly enhanced mitochondrial functional efficiency. Growth-related parameters including root and shoot lengths and dry weight were increased by 44-58% in the Mim-0.1 group compared to that of the -Se-stressed group. Oxygen uptake by mitochondria of Mim-0.1 group, studied with different substrates, revealed enhanced State 3 respiratory rates with regulated State 4 rates, resulting in high respiratory control ratio (RCR) of 3.4 to 3.9 indicative of a high degree of oxidative coupling. Specific activities of mitochondrial electron transport enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) (NADH)-cytochrome (cyt) c oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cyt c oxidase in the Mim-0.1 group were enhanced by 53% to threefold over those of the Se-stressed group. Marked decreases in the extent of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation ensued upon mimosine exposure, indicative of its antioxidant function. Mitochondrial 45Ca2+ uptake was notably augmented twofold in the Mim-0.1 group, compared to the Se-stressed group. Detailed kinetic analyses of Ca2+ uptake revealed positive cooperative interactions in both -Se-stressed group and Mim-0.1 groups with Hill coefficient (nH) values of 1.7 and 2, respectively. The present study establishes the beneficial effects of mimosine exposure at 0.1 mM on the growth and mitochondrial function of the seedlings grown under selenium-deficient stressed condition and a significant physiological role can be ascribed to mimosine."
2014,24733675,Triterpenoid saponins from the roots of Rosa rugosa Thunb. as rat intestinal sucrase inhibitors.,"Medicinal plants constitute an important source of potential therapeutic agents for diabetes. The purpose of present study is to investigate the effect of root extract of Rosa rugosa Thunb. on inhibition of sucrase related to diabetes mellitus (DM). Bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanol extract led to the identification of 13 triterpenoid saponins (1-13). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D, 2D NMR, and MS. The n-butanol fraction showed potent rat intestinal sucrase inhibitory activity with value of 87.62 ± 5.84 % inhibition compared to the positive control acarbose (50.96 ± 2.97 % inhibition at 0.02 mM). Subsequently, compounds 11-13 (1.0 mM) exhibited significant sucrase inhibitory activity, with inhibition percentage values of 41.17 ± 3.52, 46.80 ± 4.00, and 39.39 ± 4.19 %, respectively. Whereas, compounds 2-6, 8, and 10 showed moderate sucrase inhibitory activity (ranging from 13.26 ± 7.00 to 32.08 ± 6.04 % inhibition) at a same concentration. The data provide a starting point for creating new sucrase inhibitors, which may be useful for the development of effective therapies for the treatment of DM. "
2019,31260994,Light-induced reactions of methionine and riboflavin in model wine: Effects of hydrolysable tannins and sulfur dioxide.,"The riboflavin-mediated photo-degradation of methionine in white wine has been related to onset of undesired light-struck taste. This research investigated the effects of different concentrations of riboflavin and methionine, hydrolysable tannins from various sources (nut galls, chestnut and oak woods) and sulfur dioxide on methionine degradation in a model wine exposed to light. Increased methionine concentration resulted in its increased degradation with the consequent formation of volatile sulfur compounds, namely methanethiol, dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide. Tannins, especially nut gall tannin, were effective in limiting both methionine degradation and the production of volatile sulfur compounds. Sulfur dioxide enhanced the methionine degradation although the light-struck taste was not perceived when sulfur dioxide concentration was higher than 50 mg/L. In conclusion, the use of hydrolysable tannins can represent a promising tool for protecting white wine against the light-struck taste also limiting the use of sulfur dioxide."
2005,16418064,Sulfation of resveratrol in human liver: evidence of a major role for the sulfotransferases SULT1A1 and SULT1E1.,"Sulfation of resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine with anticancer and cardioprotective activities, was studied in human liver cytosol. In the presence of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, three metabolites (M1-3) whose structures were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR as trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, trans-resveratrol-4'-O-sulfate, and trans-resveratrol-3-O-4'-O-disulfate, respectively. The kinetics of M1 formation in human liver cytosol exhibited an pattern of substrate inhibition with a K(i) of 21.3 +/- 8.73 microM and a V(max)/K(m) of 1.63 +/- 0.41 microLmin(-1)mg(-1) protein. Formation of M2 and M3 showed sigmoidal kinetics with about 56-fold higher V(max)/K(m) values for M3 than for M2 (2.23 +/- 0.14 and 0.04 +/- 0.01 microLmin(-1)mg(-1)). Incubation in the presence of human recombinant sulfotransferases (SULTs) demonstrated that M1 is almost exclusively catalysed by SULT1A1 and only to a minor extent by SULT 1A2, 1A3 and 1E1, whereas M2 is selectively formed by SULT1A2. M3 is mainly catalysed by SULT1A2 and 1A3. In conclusion, the results elucidate the enzymatic pathways of resveratrol in human liver, which must be considered in humans following oral uptake of dietary resveratrol."
2014,24360450,Development of a simple fluorescence-based microplate method for the high-throughput analysis of proline in wine samples.,"This paper presents a simple, accurate and multi-sample method for the determination of proline in wines thanks to a 96-well microplate technique. Proline is the most abundant amino acid in wine and is an important parameter related to wine characteristics or maturation processes of grape. In the current study, an improved application of the general method based on sodium hypochlorite oxidation and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA)-thiol spectrofluorometric detection is described. The main interfering compounds for specific proline detection in wines are strongly reduced by selective reaction with OPA in a preliminary step under well-defined pH conditions. Application of the protocol after a 500-fold dilution of wine samples provides a working range between 0.02 and 2.90gL(-1), with a limit of detection of 7.50mgL(-1). Comparison and validation on real wine samples by ion-exchange chromatography prove that this procedure yields accurate results. Simplicity of the protocol used, with no need for centrifugation or filtration, organic solvents or high temperature enables its full implementation in plastic microplates and efficient application for routine analysis of proline in wines.

2013,23673139,Curcuma oil ameliorates hyperlipidaemia and associated deleterious effects in golden Syrian hamsters.,"Essential oil components from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) are documented for neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-thrombotic and antioxidant effects. The present study aimed to investigate the disease-modifying potential of curcuma oil (C. oil), a lipophilic component from C. longa L., in hyperlipidaemic hamsters. Male golden Syrian hamsters were fed a chow or high-cholesterol (HC) and fat-rich diet with or without C. oil (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) for 28 d. In HC diet-fed hamsters, C. oil significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TAG, and increased HDL-cholesterol when compared with the HC group. Similar group comparisons showed that C. oil treatment reduced hepatic cholesterol and oxidative stress, and improved liver function. Hyperlipidaemia-induced platelet activation, vascular dysfunction and repressed eNOS mRNA expression were restored by the C. oil treatment. Furthermore, aortic cholesterol accumulation and CD68 expression were also reduced in the C. oil-treated group. The effect of C. oil at 300 mg/kg was comparable with the standard drug ezetimibe. Delving into the probable anti-hyperlipidaemic mechanism at the transcript level, the C. oil-treated groups fed the chow and HC diets were compared with the chow diet-fed group. The C. oil treatment significantly increased the hepatic expression of PPARa, LXRa, CYP7A1, ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and LPL accompanied by reduced SREBP-2 and HMGCR expression. C. oil also enhanced ABCA1, ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression and suppressed NPC1L1 expression in the jejunum. In the present study, C. oil demonstrated an anti-hyperlipidaemic effect and reduced lipid-induced oxidative stress, platelet activation and vascular dysfunction. The anti-hyperlipidaemic effect exhibited by C. oil seems to be mediated by the modulation of PPARa, LXRa and associated genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport."
2007,17827685,Evaluation of nutritional availability and anti-tumor activity of selenium contained in selenium-enriched Kaiware radish sprouts.,"We estimated the nutritional availability of selenium (Se) in Se-enriched Kaiware radish sprouts (SeRS) by the tissue Se deposition and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity of rats administered the sprouts, and examined the effect of SeRS on the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon of mice administered 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) to evaluate anti-tumor activity. Male weanling Wistar rats were divided into seven groups and fed a Se-deficient basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 0.05, 0.10, or 0.15 microg/g of Se as sodium selenite or SeRS for 28 d. Supplementation with Se dose-dependently increased serum and liver Se concentrations and GPX activities, and the selenite-supplemented groups showed a higher increase than the SeRS-supplemented groups. The nutritional availability of Se in SeRS was estimated to be 33 or 64% by slope ratio analysis. Male 4-week-old A/J mice were divided into seven groups and fed a low Se basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with selenite, SeRS, or selenite + non-Se-enriched radish sprouts (NonSeRS) at a level of 0.1 or 2.0 microg Se/g for 9 weeks. After 1 week of feeding, all mice were given six subcutaneous injections of DMH (20 mg/kg) at 1-week intervals. The average number of ACF formed in the colon of mice fed the basal diet was 4.3. At a supplementation level of 0.1 mug Se/g, only SeRS significantly inhibited ACF formation. At a supplementation level of 2.0 microg Se/g, both selenite and SeRS significantly inhibited ACF formation. The addition of NonSeRS to the selenite-supplemented diets tended to inhibit ACF formation, but this was not statistically significant. These results indicate that SeRS shows lower nutritional availability but higher anti-tumor activity than selenite."
1984,6093649,Effect of levamisole on lymphocyte blastogenesis and neutrophil function in dexamethasone-treated cattle.,"Levamisole was evaluated at 6 dose levels for its ability to prevent the dexamethasone-induced suppression of in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis or neutrophil function in cattle. Dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg of body weight, IM) and levamisole hydrochloride (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 mg/kg orally) were administered to groups of 4 cattle daily for 3 days. Another group of 4 cattle were given the 3-day dexamethasone treatment and 6.0 mg/kg of levamisole (the recommended anthelmintic dose) was given only once on the 1st day that dexamethasone was given. Results obtained from the dexamethasone-levamisole-treated cattle were compared with results obtained from cattle that were given only dexamethasone. Levamisole had no apparent consistent ability to enhance lymphocyte blastogenic responsiveness (to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen or in a 1-way mixed lymphocyte reaction) or to enhance neutrophil function (random migration, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, iodination, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) in dexamethasone-treated cattle."
1988,3189991,Thyroid and immunologic status of dogs with perianal fistula.,"Lymphocyte-proliferation responses, absolute lymphocyte counts, and thyrotropin-stimulation responses were determined in 33 dogs with perianal fistula; serum immunoglobulin values also were determined in 15 of the 33 dogs. Lymphocytes were stimulated with concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and phytohemagglutinin and were cultured with medium containing normal pooled canine serum or fresh patient's autologous serum. Initially, lymphocytes from 9 dogs (27.3%) had depressed stimulation responses to greater than or equal to 1 phytomitogen, and 4 of the 9 dogs had absolute lymphopenia. One month after recovery in these 9 dogs, lymphocytes from 4 dogs (66.7%) had normal proliferation responses. Of immunoglobulin determinations in 15 dogs, serum IgA values were 32 to 185 mg/dl (mean, 69 +/- 10 mg/dl) and were low in 2 dogs (13%), and serum IgM values were 48 to 610 mg/dl (mean, 263 to 46 mg/dl) and were high in 8 dogs (53%). Serum IgG values were 1,050 to 3,220 mg/dl (mean, 2,339 +/- 165 mg/dl) and were high in 10 dogs (71%). After thyrotropin stimulation, 1 dog was considered hypothyroid. Neither pathogenesis nor prognosis of canine perianal fistula was clarified via immunoglobulin concentrations or absolute lymphocyte counts. Based on lymphocyte-proliferation assays, suppression of cell-mediated immunity was probably a result of perianal fistula, rather than a cause of the fistula."
2011,21963507,meso-Dihydroguaiaretic acid inhibits hepatic lipid accumulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in human HepG2 cells.,"Hepatic lipid accumulation is a major risk factor for dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and insulin resistance. The present study was conducted to evaluate hypolipidemic effects of meso-dihydroguaiaretic acid (MDA), anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory compound isolated from the Myristica fragrans HOUTT., by oil red O staining, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot. MDA significantly inhibited insulin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. The lipid-lowering effect of MDA was accompanied by increased expression of proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation and decreased expression of lipid synthetic proteins. In addition, MDA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as determined by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK. The effects of MDA on lipogenic protein expression were suppressed by pretreatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Taken together, these findings show that MDA inhibits insulin-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 cells by suppressing expression of lipogenic proteins through AMPK signaling, suggesting a potent lipid-lowering agent."
2007,17592514,Cannabidiol in vivo blunts beta-amyloid induced neuroinflammation by suppressing IL-1beta and iNOS expression.,"Pharmacological inhibition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive gliosis may represent a novel rationale to develop drugs able to blunt neuronal damage and slow the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychotropic natural cannabinoid, exerts in vitro a combination of neuroprotective effects in different models of Abeta neurotoxicity. The present study, performed in a mouse model of AD-related neuroinflammation, was aimed at confirming in vivo the previously reported antiinflammatory properties of CBD.Mice were inoculated with human Abeta (1-42) peptide into the right dorsal hippocampus, and treated daily with vehicle or CBD (2.5 or 10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) for 7 days. mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed by in situ hybridization. Protein expression of GFAP, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1beta was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, ELISA assay of IL-1beta level and the measurement of NO were performed in dissected and homogenized ipsilateral hippocampi, derived from vehicle and Abeta inoculated mice, in the absence or presence of CBD.In contrast to vehicle, CBD dose-dependently and significantly inhibited GFAP mRNA and protein expression in Abeta injected animals. Moreover, under the same experimental conditions, CBD impaired iNOS and IL-1beta protein expression, and the related NO and IL-1beta release.The results of the present study confirm in vivo anti-inflammatory actions of CBD, emphasizing the importance of this compound as a novel promising pharmacological tool capable of attenuating Abeta evoked neuroinflammatory responses."
2014,24641096,Treatment of port wine stains with pulsed dye laser and topical timolol: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Neoangiogenesis occurs within days following laser treatment of port wine stains (PWS), and plays a central role in treatment failures. Topical use of timolol can significantly reduce the production of vascular endothelial growth factor in vitro, and in animal models.The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of topical timolol in combination with pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment, compared with PDL alone, for treating PWS.This was a prospective multicenter controlled trial performed in children with PWS of the face who had not previously received laser treatment. After randomization, one group was treated with PDL alone, and the other with PDL followed by twice daily applications of timolol gel. Three laser sessions were performed at 1-month intervals with fixed parameters. The evaluation was performed on standardized pictures by two independent physicians blinded to the treatment received. The primary endpoint was marked or complete improvement of the PWS [Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 3 or 4] 1 month after the third session.Twenty-two children were included. Two patients were lost to follow-up. There was no difference in the success rate between the two groups (IGA 3 or 4 observed in one of 10 patients and two of 12 patients, for PDL alone, and for PDL associated with topical timolol, respectively; P = 1·0). No side-effect related to the application of topical timolol was observed.The addition of timolol gel for preventing neoangiogenesis failed to significantly improve the efficacy of PDL treatment of PWS."
2017,28759758,Kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) ameliorates gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in albino mice via the activation of Nrf2 and the inhibition of NF-κB (Kiwi & gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity).,"Gentamicin is a potent aminoglycoside antibiotic, but the risk of nephrotoxicity limits its prolonged use. The toxicity of gentamicin is believed to result from oxidative stress, a condition that could be counteracted by dietary antioxidants. This study determines the possible renoprotective effects of kiwifruit against the pathophysiological and ultrastructural alterations induced by gentamicin. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with gentamicin (100mg/kg body weight) for eight consecutive days, and kiwi juice was administered for 8days, either concomitant to or after gentamicin injection. Gentamicin caused nephrotoxicity evidenced by the significant elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, along with significant reduction of serum sodium and potassium ions, compared to normal controls. This was associated with proximal tubular necrosis, lysosomal accumulation and mitochondrial alterations, together with glomerular atrophy, mesangial hypercellularity, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Moreover, immunohistochemical results pointed to the relevant role of Nrf2 and NF-κB in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Kiwi administration, especially when given after gentamicin injection, significantly ameliorated gentamicin-induced pathophysiological alterations, increased the nuclear immunoreactivity of Nrf2 and decreased that of NF-κB. In short, kiwi fruit shows a promising role as a nephroprotective agent against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity via attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death."

2013,23092289,The use of lentinan for treating gastric cancer.,"Natural compounds containing fungal β-glucans have been used to improve general health for thousands of years in China and Japan. Lentinan, the backbone of β-(1, 3)-glucan with β-(1, 6) branches, is one of the active ingredients purified from Shiitake mushrooms and has been approved as a biological response modifier for the treatment of gastric cancer in Japan. Despite recent advances in chemotherapeutic agents, unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer remains an incurable disease, with survival rates being far from satisfactory. Recent clinical studies have shown that chemo-immunotherapy using lentinan prolongs the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer, as compared to chemotherapy alone. In addition, trastuzumab, an antibody against HER2/neu growth factor receptor, has been used for the treatment of gastric cancer in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Lentinan may exert a synergistic action with anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies to activate complement systems through the mechanism of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement dependent cytotoxicity. Because a better understanding of its biological activities should enable us to use lentinan more efficiently in the treatment of gastric cancer, immunological effects provided by β-glucans, a possible mode of action of lentinan, and its clinical application including future potential uses are discussed in the present review."

Arzanol has been reported to possess a variety of pharmacological activities. However, anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, and antioxidant activities have been studied in some detail. Arzanol has been reported to inhibit inflammatory transcription factor NF κB activation, HIV replication in T cells, releases of IL-1 β , IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α , and biosynthesis of PGE₂ by potentially inhibiting mPGES-1 enzyme. Diversity of mechanisms of actions of arzanol may be useful in treatment of disease involving these inflammatory mediators such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. This review presents comprehensive information on the chemistry, structure-activity relationship, and pharmacological activities of arzanol. In addition this review discusses recent developments and the scope for future research in these aspects."
2017,28610577,Coronary angiogenic effect of long-term administration of Nigella sativa.,"Coronary angiogenesis is one of the preferable adaptive responses of aerobic training. Previous studies found inotropic and hypertrophic cardiac effects for long-term administration of Nigella sativa (NS), but no studies have explored its coronary angiogenic effect. The present study compared the effect of long-term NS- administration and exercise training on the induction of coronary angiogenesis.Fifteen adult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control, NS-fed, and exercise-trained (Ex). The NS-fed rats were administered 800 mg/Kg NS orally for eight weeks. The (Ex) rats were trained on a five-lane treadmill at a speed of 18 m/min and a grade of 32° for two hour/day for eight weeks. After the experiment, the hearts were extracted and immunohistological slides were prepared using rat vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) antibodies (Ab). Photomicrographs were analysed using ImageJ software, and the % of the immunostained-area of 10 fields per specimen was recorded.VEGF was significantly higher in the NS- (2.59±1.37%) and Ex rats (2.51±1.86%) compared to the control group (1.58±0.78%) with P<0.01. The VWF was significantly lower in the two experimental groups (1.57±0.83%, 1.07±0.72%) for NS and Ex groups respectively, compared to the controls (2.38±1.72) with p<0.01. Only Ex group had a higher PECAM-1 (1.79±0.78%) and lower NOS-2 (0.83±0.57%) than the control group (1.19±1.17%, 1.25±1.19%) for PECAM-1 and NOS-2 with P<0.01 and P<0.05 respectively.The present study demonstrated an increase in VEGF and a decrease of the VWF in the hearts of Nigella-fed and exercise-trained rats. This might indicate the potentiality for induction of coronary angiogenesis via long-term administration of NS and exercise training. NS effect on coronary angiogenesis needs to be explored further as it might lead to a new promising preventive and therapeutic agent of the ischemic heart disease."
2018,30259884,Bioconjugation of Captopril-Light Subunit of Agaricus bisporus Mushroom Tyrosinase: Characterization and Potential Use as a Drug Carrier for Oral Delivery.,"We show that a lectin like protein from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus (LSMT) is capable to permeate the epithelial monolayer barrier of the intestine ex vivo. The protein is not toxic or immunogenic upon prolonged administration and elevated dose in mice. Thus, it could be a candidate as a drug carrier for oral administration. However, its permeability should be tested after the protein has been modified, mimicking the condition in which it is used as a drug carrier. The protein was conjugated to captopril, the selected model of a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class III drug, with high solubility but poor permeability. The drug was conjugated to LSMT that had been modified with 4-succinimidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-2-pyridyldithiotoluene (SMPT) as a linker. The success of LSMT modification was confirmed with TLC and MS; the latter also indicated the amount of captopril molecule linked. The modified LSMT could permeate through the intestinal monolayer barrier, and thus could be absorbed in the intestine after modification. The modified protein appears to remain stable after incubation in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. This pioneering work provides an essential basis for further development of the protein as a drug carrier for oral administration."
2011,21628893,23-Hydroxytormentic acid and niga-ichgoside f₁ isolated from Rubus coreanus attenuate cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress in renal epithelial LLC-PK₁ cells.,"The unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus (Rosaceae) are used in traditional Chinese medicine to relieve kidney dysfunction. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of the triterpenoid glycoside niga-ichigoside F₁ (NIF₁) and of its aglycone 23-hydroxytormentic acid (23-HTA) isolated from the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus (Rosaceae) against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in renal epithelial LLC-PK₁ cells. Pretreating LLC-PK₁ cells with 23-HTA or NIF₁ was found to prevent cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, 23-HTA or NIF₁ pretreatment significantly improved the changes associated with cisplatin toxicity by increasing levels of glutathione (GSH) and decreasing levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activity of antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower in cisplatin-treated LL-PK₁ cells, and 23-HTA or NIF₁ treatment notably increased the these enzyme activity and protein and mRNA levels of CAT and manganese SOD (MnSOD). Moreover, cisplatin caused a significant decrease in nuclear levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and pretreatment with 23-HTA or NIF₁ significantly suppressed the cisplatin-induced translocation of Nrf2 in LLC-PK₁ cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 23-HTA ameliorates cisplatin-induced toxicity via modulation of antioxidant enzymes through activation of Nrf2 in LLC-PK₁ cells."
2015,26618584,Effect of low-energy laser irradiation and antioxidant supplementation on cell apoptosis during skeletal muscle post-injury regeneration in pigs.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-energy laser irradiation, coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E supplementation on the apoptosis of macrophages and muscle precursor cells during skeletal muscle regeneration after bupivacaine-induced injury. The experiment was conducted on 75 gilts, divided into 5 experimental groups: I--control, II--low-energy laser irradiation, III--coenzyme Q10, IV--coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E, V--vitamin E. Muscle necrosis was induced by injection of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride. The animals were euthanized on subsequent days after injury. Samples were formalin fixed and processed routinely for histopathology. Apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL method. The obtained results indicate that low-energy laser irradiation has a beneficial effect on macrophages and muscle precursor cell activity during muscle post-injury regeneration and protects these cells against apoptosis. Vitamin E has a slightly lower protective effect, limited mainly to the macrophages. Coenzyme Q10 co-supplemented with vitamin E increases the activity of macrophages and muscle precursor cells, myotube and young muscle formation. Importantly, muscle precursor cells seem to be more sensitive to apoptosis than macrophages in the environment of regenerating damaged muscle."
2018,29374382,Zinc Supplementation Does Not Affect Glucagon Response to Intravenous Glucose and Insulin Infusion in Patients with Well-Controlled Type 2 Diabetes.,"Glucagon dysregulation is an essential component in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Studies in vitro and in animal models have shown that zinc co-secreted with insulin suppresses glucagon secretion. Zinc supplementation improves blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes, although there is little information about how zinc supplementation may affect glucagon secretion. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 1-year zinc supplementation on fasting plasma glucagon concentration and in response to intravenous glucose and insulin infusion in patients with type 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional study was performed after 1-year of intervention with 30 mg/day zinc supplementation or a placebo on 28 patients with type 2 diabetes. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were determined. Fasting plasma glucagon and in response to intravenous glucose and insulin infusion were evaluated. Patients of both placebo and supplemented groups presented a well control of diabetes, with mean values of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin within the therapeutic goals established by ADA. No significant differences were observed in plasma glucagon concentration, glucagon/glucose ratio or glucagon/insulin ratio fasting, after glucose or after insulin infusions between placebo and supplemented groups. No significant effects of glucose or insulin infusions were observed on plasma glucagon concentration. One-year zinc supplementation did not affect fasting plasma glucagon nor response to intravenous glucose or insulin infusion in well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients with an adequate zinc status."
2018,30248544,Attenuation of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) - Induced hepatic cancer in experimental model of Wistar rats by Carissa carandas embedded silver nanoparticles.,"Hepatic cancer is well known, and leading cancer around the world and remain asymptomatic diseases. Carissa carandas possess anti-proliferative, antioxidant, hepatoprotective property and used in hepatic cancer. The current study deals to evaluate the chemoprotective and therapeutic property of Carissa carandas embedded silver nanoparticles (CCAgNPs) against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) -induced hepatic cancer.Wistar rats were divided into six groups and hepatic cancer was induced with diethylnitrosamine at the dose of 200 mg/kg BW. The animals were gastrogavaged with standard drug and CCAgNPs for 16 weeks. Serum biomarkers, haematological profile, antioxidants enzymes, inflammatory markers and membrane bound enzymes were assessed to find the anti-proliferative potential of silver nanoparticles. Histological evaluation and microscopic characterizations were also performed to authenticate the outcomes of the present work.Biosynthesized CCAgNPs significantly down-regulated the serum marker enzymes of hepatic and non-hepatic parameter, elevated the levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant profile, elevation in membrane bound enzymes and diminish the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) via NF-κB pathway. Histopathological features also showed recovery of a hepatic architecture in cancer-induced rats in a dose-dependent manner.Our consequences established that such plant mediated silver nanoparticles shown a defensive impact against DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and serves as a better option to ameliorate the clinical results against hepatocellular carcinoma."
2000,10755706,Relationship between blood/air partition coefficients of lipophilic organic solvents and blood triglyceride levels.,"The blood/air partition coefficient is one of the important parameters for understanding the pharmacokinetics of organic solvents. In conventional pharmacokinetic models, the partition coefficient has been used as a constant value for each solvent. However, blood triglyceride content varies according to a diet, and the variation may affect the partition coefficient of lipophilic organic solvents. In this study, the relationship between the blood/air partition coefficient of lipophilic organic solvents and plasma triglyceride concentrations was clarified. Corn oil (4.0 ml/kg) was administered orally to male Wistar rats, and blood samples were collected 3 h after the administration, when the plasma triglyceride level reached a peak. Control rats received the same amount of distilled water via the same route. The blood/air partition coefficients of five types of lipophilic solvents (m-xylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) were determined in these two groups of blood samples. The hematological and biochemical parameters were also examined in the same blood samples. Although the mean plasma triglyceride level in the oil group increased about 3.3 times compared with that in the control group, the increase in the blood/air partition coefficients of the five lipophilic solvents was relatively low (approximately 1.2-1.5 times). We concluded that the diet has no significant effect on the blood/air partition coefficients of organic solvents, and the value can be used as a constant parameter for each solvent in a physiological simulation model."
1988,3400922,Effect of levamisole on immune function and reproductive performance in first-litter gilts.,"First-litter commercial cross-bred gilts were treated with levamisole (1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 mg/kg of body weight) weekly during the last 4 weeks of gestation, because similar treatment of dairy heifers had improved postpartum maternal health and neonatal survival. In the gilts, differences in reproductive performance were not found on the basis of pig survival at birth, pig survival at weaning, birth weight, or weaning weight. Also, differences between treated and control gilts were not found in response of circulating lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation (phytohemagglutinin A, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen). In all gilts, the lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation was decreased during the first week after farrowing."
2008,18620848,Genetic characterisation of CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli strains isolated from stem cell transplant patients in Tunisia.,"Characterisation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and their genetic environments as well as the presence of integrons were analysed in nine Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Escherichia coli ESBL-positive isolates recovered in the Centre of Bone Marrow Transplantation of Tunisia. All strains harboured the bla(CTX-M-15) gene and presented minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime and ceftazidime of 256-1024 mg L(-1) and 16-512 mg L(-1), respectively, and eight of them showed different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. The bla(OXA-1) and bla(TEM-1) genes were detected in eight and ten strains, respectively. In addition, bla(SHV-1), bla(SHV-11) and bla(SHV-27) were found in six, one and one K. pneumoniae strains, respectively. The new variant bla(SHV-103) was characterised in one K. pneumoniae strain. The intI1 gene was detected in eight K. pneumoniae strains and the dfrA5+ereA2 and aadA gene cassettes were found in one and five strains, respectively. All strains harboured a 70 kb plasmid, and its transference in addition to bla(CTX-M-15), bla(TEM-1b) and bla(OXA-1) genes was demonstrated from three K. pneumoniae to E. coli. ISEcp1 and orf477 were located upstream and downstream, respectively, of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene in 10 strains. The occurrence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene in unrelated strains might have originated from the dissemination of mobile genetic elements in which ISEcp1 may have played an important role."

The study of hange-shashin-to, kanzo-shashin-to, shokyo-shashin-to with adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate phosphodiesterase].","Fifty-nine species of extracts of Chinese herbal medicinal prescription were tested for inhibitory activity of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE). Kanzo-shashin-to showed the highest activity in these prescriptions. Kanzo-shashin-to, Hange-shashin-to and Shokyo-shashin-to, whose contracting crude drugs were very similar, were especially studied among these prescriptions. Pinellia tuber acted as an ascent component for Scutellaria root and a mitigatory component for Giycyrrhiza. Jujube acted as a mitigatory component for Glycyrrhiza. Ginger acted as an additional component for Scutellaria root in cAMP PDE test. This additional effect of 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol from Ginger and baicalin from Scutellaria root were investigated."
2019,31159212,Effects of Integrated Rice-Frog Farming on Paddy Field Greenhouse Gas Emissions.,"Integrated rice-frog farming (IRFF), as a mode of ecological farming, is fundamental in realizing sustainable development in agriculture. Yet its production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains unclear. Here, a randomized plot field experiment was performed to study the GHG emissions for various farming systems during the rice growing season. The farming systems included: conventional farming (CF), green integrated rice-frog farming (GIRF), and organic integrated rice-frog farming (OIRF). Results indicate that the cumulative methane (CH4) emissions from the whole growth period were divergent for the three farming systems, with OIRF having the highest value and CF having the lowest. For nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, the order is reversed. IRFF significantly increased the dissolved oxygen (DO), soil redox potential (Eh), total organic carbon (TOC) content, and soil C:N ratio, which is closely related to GHG emissions in rice fields. Additionally, the average emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soils during rice growing seasons ranged from 2312.27 to 2589.62 kg ha-1 and showed no significant difference in the three treatments. Rice yield in the GIRF and OIRF were lower (2.0% and 16.7%) than the control. The CH4 emissions contributed to 83.0-96.8% of global warming potential (GWP). Compared to CF, the treatment of GIRF and OIRF increased the GWP by 41.3% and 98.2% during the whole growing period of rice, respectively. IRFF significantly increased greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI, 0.79 kg CO2-eq ha-1 grain yield), by 91.1% over the control. Compared to the OIRF, GIRF decreased the GHGI by approximately 39.4% (0.59 kg CO2-eq ha-1 grain yield), which was 44.2% higher than that of the control. The results of structural equation model showed that the contribution of fertilization to CH4 emissions in paddy fields was much greater than that of frog activity. Moreover, frog activity could decrease GWP by reducing CH4 emissions from rice fields. And while GIRF showed a slight increase in GHG emissions, it could still be considered as a good strategy for providing an environmentally-friendly option in maintaining crop yield in paddy fields."
1994,7831502,Differential patterns of relaxation by atrial natriuretic peptide in major blood vessels of two distantly related teleosts.,"In order to elucidate the role of the atrial hormone in the teleost circulation, the vascular effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have been compared in major blood vessels of the cod (Gadus morhua) and of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The relaxing effects of ANP from eel (eANP) have been examined in ventral aorta (VA) versus dorsal aorta (DA) in the cod and in VA versus the coeliaco mesenteric artery (CMA), a major branch of DA, in the salmon. The vessels were precontracted by acetylcholine (ACh) and adrenaline (A) and by the mammalian endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1). The role of endothelial integrity for these responses has been assessed in vessels either mechanically probed or chemically impaired by indomethacin or the L-arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Adrenaline and noradrenaline (NA) failed to contract the salmon VA. In the salmon vessels, eANP was without relaxing effects in ACh-contracted VA, while completely relaxing CMA when precontracted with ACh. The eANP was also a relaxant of A-contracted CMA and of ET-1-contracted VA. The cod vessels, which were insensitive to ACh were markedly relaxed by eANP when precontracted with either A (VA) or ET-1 (DA). In DA also the resting tension was reversed, an effect of eANP that was highly potentiated in mechanical probed vessels. Otherwise the relaxing effects of eANP in these vessels were seemingly independent of endothelial factors. In conclusion ANP is not a general relaxant of the precontracted VA which in teleosts is the first possible target vessel for the myocardial release of this hormone. On the arterial side ANP serves as a relaxant both in the salmon and the cod vessels, indicating that myocardial release of ANP in teleosts may have an important role in regulation of blood flow via diverse, species-specific effects on major blood vessels on both sides of the gills."

2005,15802808,Identification of Panax species in the herbal medicine preparations using gradient PCR method.,"In order to identify the existence of Panax species in herbal medicine preparations, the Ginseng specific marker primer was selected and created based on the sequence of Korean ginseng DNA fragment, 359 bp. The gradient PCR was performed on 40 types of the herbal medicines including the 7 types of Araliaceae that are in the same family with the Panax ginseng using the created Ginseng maker primer. As result, Panax notoginseng (Chinese), Panax japonicus (Japanese) and Panax quinquefolius (American), along with Panax ginseng (Korean) were the only ones amplified. However, in the case of Atractylodes lancea, one of the herbal medicines not categorized as Panax species, the DNA was prominently amplified by the Ginseng marker primer. The sequence of the amplified DNA of Atractylodes lancea was identified, resulting in enabling the differentiation from the Panax species by the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP) method. In addition, the results of the gradient PCR performed on the herbal medicine preparations that consists of Panax ginseng showed that 290 bp size of the original DNA fragments of Panax ginseng was amplified on the herbal medicine preparations containing Panax ginseng. Therefore, these results suggest a possibility of creating a new testing method for identifying specific herb medicines using the gradient PCR, a molecular biological method not only on Panax ginseng, but also on other herbal medicines and herbal medicine preparations."

2011,21736796,"Effects of Nori- and Wakame-enriched meats with or without supplementary cholesterol on arylesterase activity, lipaemia and lipoproteinaemia in growing Wistar rats.","Some seaweeds exert antioxidant and hypocholesterolaemic properties. The effects of diets including restructured meats (RM) containing Wakame (W) or Nori (N) algae on arylesterase (AE) activity and lipoprotein concentration and composition were tested. In the present study, six groups of ten male growing Wistar rats each were fed a mix of 85 % AIN-93M diet and 15 % freeze-dried RM for 35 d. The control group (C) consumed control RM, the W and N groups consumed RM with 5 % W and 5 % N, respectively. The cholesterol-enriched C (CC), W (CW) and N (CN) groups consumed their corresponding basal diets with supplementary cholesterol (2·43 %) and cholic acid (0·49 %). Cholesterol in the diet induced lower (P < 0·001) growth ratios. Both W and N diets significantly increased AE activity. VLDL-cholesterol values were lower in N rats than in W rats. AE activity increased (P < 0·001) in CC and CW rats but not in CN rats compared with their corresponding counterparts. AE was lower (P < 0·05) in the CN group than in the CC and CW groups. The CN diet partially blocked (P < 0·001) the hypercholesterolaemic induction observed in CC and CW diets and reduced TAG levels (at least P < 0·05) with respect to those of CC rats. Although dietary cholesterol supplementation increased total cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and (intermediate-density lipoprotein+LDL)-cholesterol (all P < 0·001) in all rats, the CN diet moderately improved the lipoprotein profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats. Changes in AE activity and plasma cholesterol in CN rats but not in CW rats suggest a possible relationship between the two parameters. It is concluded that inclusion of RM enriched with N may be used in hypercholesterolaemic diets to improve lipoprotein metabolism."
2013,23721741,Cardioprotective effect of cannabidiol in rats exposed to doxorubicin toxicity.,"The potential protective effect of cannabidiol, the major non-psychotropic Cannabis constituent, was investigated against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in rats. Cardiotoxicity was induced by six equal doses of doxorubicin (2.5mgkg(-1) i.p., each) given at 48h intervals over two weeks to achieve a total dose of 15mgkg(-1). Cannabidiol treatment (5mgkg(-1)/day, i.p.) was started on the same day of doxorubicin administration and continued for four weeks. Cannabidiol significantly reduced the elevations of serum creatine kinase-MB and troponin T, and cardiac malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide and calcium ion levels, and attenuated the decreases in cardiac reduced glutathione, selenium and zinc ions. Histopathological examination showed that cannabidiol ameliorated doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cannabidiol significantly reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-κB, Fas ligand and caspase-3, and increased the expression of survivin in cardiac tissue of doxorubicin-treated rats. These results indicate that cannabidiol represents a potential protective agent against doxorubicin cardiac injury. "
1982,6280528,Isolation of viable canine intestinal lymphocytes.,"A modification of a previously reported enzymatic technique was used to isolate 60% to 90% pure populations of viable lymphocytes from canine small intestinal mucosa. Mitogenesis assays were then simultaneously performed on these and isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from the same dogs. A technique to isolate intraepithelial lymphocytes was not successful. Intestinal mucosal lymphocytes were simultaneously purified by 2 different techniques (suspensions B and C), which produced cell populations that responded similarly to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogens. The peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrated greater response to PHA and concanavalin A mitogens than did the intestinal mucosal lymphocytes (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, peripheral blood lymphocytes had a significantly higher response to PHA than to pokeweed mitogen (P less than 0.05). The impure preparation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (suspension A) did not show any evidence of reactivity to mitogens. Further studies are needed to determine whether the EDTA or collagenase had any effect upon the intestinal mucosal lymphocyte responsiveness. The present study demonstrated that viable mucosal lymphocytes can be isolated from the canine intestine and that they can maintain their responsiveness to mitogens."

The protective mechanism involved was also investigated. Beer samples were found to inhibit the mutagenicity of HCAs in the Ames test. Beer solution, consisting of a freeze-dried and dissolved sample, given as drink-water significantly reduced the formation of PhIP-DNA adducts in mouse colon and lung compared to control mice fed with PhIP in the absence of beer solution. Furthermore, beer solution added in the diet as a food additive mimic significantly reduced the amount of DNA adducts present in the liver and lung of mice fed with PhIP. In an effort to investigate the mechanism responsible for the observed protective effect, the effect of beer solutions on HCA metabolizing enzymes was investigated. Beer solutions inhibited the activity of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, as determined from deethylation and demethylation assays using 7-ethoxy- and 7-methoxyresolufin, respectively. Considering the overall suppression of PhIP genotoxicity by beer, this study confirmed that beer components can interfere with the enzyme activity involved in the metabolism of HCAs and subsequently suppress the observed genotoxicity. The results of this study showed that beer components act in a protective capacity against the genotoxic effects of heterocyclic amines in vivo."

It doubled all three at 69, 29, and 221 nM, respectively. The protein had anticoagulant activity when given intravenously and orally. The maximum delay in the activated partial thromboplastin time was at the dose of 0.52 and 4.2 mg/kg for intravenous and oral administration, respectively. This protein may be useful in clinical applications for anticoagulation."
2012,23110485,"Antibacterial, antioxidant and tyrosinase-inhibition activities of pomegranate fruit peel methanolic extract.","This study evaluated, using in vitro assays, the antibacterial, antioxidant, and tyrosinase-inhibition activities of methanolic extracts from peels of seven commercially grown pomegranate cultivars.Antibacterial activity was tested on Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) using a microdilution method. Several potential antioxidant activities, including radical-scavenging ability (RSA), ferrous ion chelating (FIC) and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), were evaluated. Tyrosinase enzyme inhibition was investigated against monophenolase (tyrosine) and diphenolase (DOPA), with arbutin and kojic acid as positive controls. Furthermore, phenolic contents including total flavonoid content (TFC), gallotannin content (GTC) and total anthocyanin content (TAC) were determined using colourimetric methods. HPLC-ESI/MSn analysis of phenolic composition of methanolic extracts was also performed.Methanolic peel extracts showed strong broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.2 to 0.78 mg/ml. At the highest concentration tested (1000 μg/ml), radical scavenging activities were significantly higher in Arakta (83.54%), Ganesh (83.56%), and Ruby (83.34%) cultivars (P< 0.05). Dose dependent FIC and FRAP activities were exhibited by all the peel extracts. All extracts also exhibited high inhibition (>50%) against monophenolase and diphenolase activities at the highest screening concentration. The most active peel extract was the Bhagwa cultivar against monophenolase and the Arakta cultivar against diphenolase with IC50 values of 3.66 μg/ml and 15.88 μg/ml, respectively. High amounts of phenolic compounds were found in peel extracts with the highest and lowest total phenolic contents of 295.5 (Ganesh) and 179.3 mg/g dry extract (Molla de Elche), respectively. Catechin, epicatechin, ellagic acid and gallic acid were found in all cultivars, of which ellagic acid was the most abundant comprising of more than 50% of total phenolic compounds detected in each cultivar.The present study showed that the tested pomegranate peels exhibited strong antibacterial, antioxidant and tyrosinase-inhibition activities. These results suggest that pomegranate fruit peel could be exploited as a potential source of natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents as well as tyrosinase inhibitors."
2012,21960141,4-Methylsulfanyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate derived from glucoraphasatin is a potent inducer of rat hepatic phase II enzymes and a potential chemopreventive agent.,"The objective of this study was to establish whether the phytochemical glucoraphasatin, a glucosinolate present in cruciferous vegetables, and its corresponding isothiocyanate, 4-methylsulfanyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate, up-regulate enzymes involved in the detoxification of carcinogens and are thus potential chemopreventive agents. Glucoraphasatin and myrosinase were isolated and purified from Daikon sprouts and Sinapis alba L., respectively. Glucoraphasatin (0-10 μM) was incubated for 24 h with precision-cut rat liver slices in the presence and absence of myrosinase, the enzyme that converts the glucosinolate to the isothiocyanate. The intact glucosinolate failed to influence the O-dealkylations of methoxy- and ethoxyresorufin or the apoprotein expression of CYP1 enzymes. Supplementation with myrosinase led to an increase in the dealkylation of methoxyresorufin, but only at the highest concentration of the glucosinolate, and CYP1A2 expression. In the absence of myrosinase, glucoraphasatin caused a marked increase in epoxide hydrolase activity at concentrations as low as 1 μM paralleled by a rise in the enzyme protein expression; at the highest concentration only, a rise was also observed in glucuronosyl transferase activity, but other phase II enzyme systems were unaffected. Addition of myrosinase to the glucoraphasatin incubation maintained the rise in epoxide hydrolase and glucuronosyl transferase activities, further elevated quinone reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities, and increased total glutathione concentrations. It is concluded that at low concentrations, glucoraphasatin, either intact and/or through the formation of 4-methylsulfanyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate, is a potent inducer of hepatic enzymes involved in the detoxification of chemical carcinogens and merits further investigation for chemopreventive activity."
2015,25912592,Can nausea and vomiting be treated with ginger extract?,"Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a spice traditionally used to treat indigestion, nausea and vomiting. Ginger extracts accelerate gastric emptying and stimulate gastric antral contractions. These effects are mainly due to the presence of gingerols and shogaols and their activity on cholinergic M receptors and serotonergic 5-HT and 5-HT receptors. Various researches on this subject have led to controversial results, due to the chemical instability of ginger extracts and particularly of gingerols, which are readily-oxidizable substances. A systematic review of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies highlighted the potential efficacy of ginger on the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting of various origins, even though additional controlled studies are needed. This review focuses on pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting and on chemotherapy induced nausea, and hypothesizes a therapeutic role for ginger extracts in case of side effects, as an alternative to traditional prokinetic drugs such as domperidone, levosulpiride or metoclopramide.

2008,18806806,Protective action of doxycycline against diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats.,"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species play an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. They can activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and MMP-2 in particular is known to mediate early consequences of oxidative stress injury in the heart. Therefore, we investigated the role of MMP-2 and the effect of the MMP inhibitor doxycycline on the changes of heart function caused by diabetes.Using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, we evaluated the effect of doxycycline on both mechanical and electrical function of isolated hearts, papillary muscle and cardiomyocytes.Doxycycline abolished the diabetes-induced depression in left ventricular developed pressure and the rates of changes in developed pressure in isolated hearts and normalized the prolongation of the action potential in papillary muscles. In cardiomyocytes isolated from doxycycline-treated diabetic rats, the altered kinetic parameters of Ca(2+) transients, depressed Ca(2+) loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum and basal intracellular Ca(2+) level, and the spatio-temporal properties of Ca(2+) sparks were significantly restored. Gelatin zymography and western blot data indicated that the diabetes-induced alterations in MMP-2 activity and protein level, level of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-4 and loss of troponin I were restored to control levels with doxycycline.Our data suggest that these beneficial effects of doxycycline on the mechanical, electrical and biochemical properties of the diabetic rat heart appear, at least in part, to be related to inhibition of MMP activity, implying a role for MMPs in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."
1998,9720795,Epigallocatechin suppression of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells: correlation with c-jun and JNK.,"1. The mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of epigallocatechin, one of the catechin derivatives found in green tea, in vascular smooth muscle cells were studied. The proliferative response was determined from the uptake of tritiated thymidine. 2. In the concentration range of 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferative response stimulated by serum in rabbit cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Catechin and epicatechin were less effective in inhibiting the serum-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation, indicating that the galloyl group may be important for full inhibitory activity. 3. Epigallocatechin (EGC) inhibited the proliferative responses in different cells including rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5 cells), rabbit cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, human coronary artery smooth muscle cells, and human CEM lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. The possible mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of EGC were further studied in A7r5 cells. 4. The membranous protein tyrosine kinase activity stimulated by serum in A7r5 cells was significantly reduced by 10(-5) M EGC. In contrast, the cytosolic protein kinase C activity stimulated by phorbol ester was unaffected by directly incubating with EGC (10(-6)-10(-4) M). 5. We also performed Western blot analysis using the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20. EGC (10(-5) M) reduced the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins with different molecular weights, indicating that EGC may inhibit the protein tyrosine kinase activity or stimulate the protein phosphatase activity. 6. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc mRNA levels demonstrated that c-jun mRNA level after serum-stimulation was significantly reduced by 10(-5) M EGC. However, the reduction of c-fos and c-myc mRNA levels by 10(-5) M EGC did not achieve significance. 7. Western blot analysis using the antibody against JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) demonstrated that the level of phosphorylated JNK1, but not phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, was reduced by 10(-5) M EGC. Direct measurement of kinase activity by immune complex kinase assay confirmed that JNK1 activity was inhibited by EGC treatment. These results demonstrate that EGC preferentially reduced the activation of JNK/SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase) signal transduction pathway. 8. It is suggested that the antiproliferative effect of epigallocatechin on vascular smooth muscle cells may partly be mediated through inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase activity, reducing c-jun mRNA expression and inhibiting JNK1 activation. Tea catechins may be useful as a template for the development of drugs to prevent the pathological changes of atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis."
2006,16564039,Antioxidant status and stress proteins in the gills of the brown mussel Perna perna exposed to zinc.,"Zinc, at low levels, has several basic housekeeping functions in metalloenzymes, transcription factors, immunoregulation, growth, and cytoprotection, displaying antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory roles. At high levels, however, the metal can be highly toxic. The aim of this work is to investigate the toxic effect of zinc on antioxidant status and stress proteins in the gills of the brown mussel Perna perna exposed for 48 h to zinc chloride (zinc) at 10, 30 and 100 microM. Glutathione reductase (GR) activity was drastically reduced at 30 and 100 microM zinc. At the lower levels, i.e. 10 microM zinc, antioxidant defenses were up-regulated, as were glutathione levels and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase, in spite of the absence of effect on glutathione S-transferase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. At the higher tested concentration of 100 microM zinc, oxidative stress was apparent as reflected by the increased lipid peroxidation end products and decreased protein thiol and glutathione levels, associated with an inability to up regulate antioxidant defenses. Using 30 microM zinc, higher gill rhodamine B efflux was observed, indicating an activation of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, which is reinforced by increased immunoreactive P-glycoprotein detection. Zinc also increased the HSP60-immunoreactive protein, whereas the HSP70-immunoreactive protein remained unchanged. Overall, the results indicate that zinc toxicity -- at higher levels -- may be connected to a strong inhibition of GR activity, and related to the pro-oxidative state found. Mussels showed an adaptive-like response to 10 microM zinc by increasing antioxidant defenses. Increased P-glycoprotein and HSP60 expression, and rhodamine B efflux were also remarkable features in the gill response to zinc."
2011,21479350,Antioxidant activity of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Jack Fruit) leaf extracts: remarkable attenuations of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.,"The present study examines the antioxidative, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities of Artocarpus heterophyllus (jack fruit) leaf extracts (JFEs). The 70% ethanol (JFEE), n-butanol (JFBE), water (JFWE), chloroform (JFCE), and ethyl acetate (JFEAE) extracts were obtained. Both JFEE and JFBE markedly scavenge diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical and chelate Fe+2 in vitro. A compound was isolated from JFBE and identified using 1D and 2D 1H- and 13C-NMR. The administration of JFEE or JFBE to streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) from 200 to 56 and 79 mg%, respectively; elevated insulin from 10.8 to 19.5 and 15.1 µU/ml, respectively; decreased lipid peroxides from 7.3 to 5.4 and 5.9 nmol/ml, respectively; decreased %glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (%HbA1C) from 6.8 to 4.5 and 5.0%, respectively; and increased total protein content from 2.5 to 6.3 and 5.7 mg%, respectively. Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), VLDL-C, and LDL/HDL ratio significantly declined by -37, -19, -23, -37, and -39%, respectively, in the case of JFEE; and by -31, -14, -17, -31, and -25%, respectively, in the case of JFBE; as compared to diabetic rats. HDL-C increased by +37% (JFEE) and by +11% (JFBE). Both JFEE and JFBE have shown appreciable results in decreasing FBG, lipid peroxides, %HbA1C, TC, LDL-C, and TG levels, and increasing insulin, HDL-C, and protein content. The spectrometric analysis confirmed that the flavonoid isolated from JFBE was isoquercitrin. We can conclude from this study that JFEE and JFBE exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in STZ-diabetic rats through an antioxidative pathway that might be referred to their flavonoid contents."
2013,23792144,Protective effects of neferine on amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.,"The effects of neferine, a bisbenzylisoquinline alkaloid extracted from the Chinese traditional medicine seed embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, on amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice were evaluated. Adult Kunming mice were induced to develop pulmonary fibrosis through intratracheal instillation of amiodarone (6.25 mg/kg) on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day. Mice were treated orally with saline, neferine (20 mg/kg), prednisolone (15 mg/kg), pirfenidone (100 mg/kg) twice a day after the third amiodarone instillation. On Day 21, all the lung tissues were collected for hydroxyproline measurement and the histological examination by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. All the blood sample were collected for surfactant protein-D (SP-D) levels assay, Th1/Th2 balance valuation, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) analysis by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Our data showed that neferine significantly restored the significant reductions in body weights, the increased levels of lung index and hydroxyproline, the abnormal histological findings, the serum SP-D increase, the Th1/Th2 imbalance by decreasing IL-4 and increasing IFN-γ levels and the increases in the population of CD4+CD25+ Tregs associated with amiodarone instillation in mice. Similar changes were also observed in the prednisolone or pirfenidone treated mice. In conclusion, these results indicated that neferine possessed a significant inhibitory effect on amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis, probably due to its properties of anti-inflammation, SP-D inhibition and restoring increased CD4+CD25+ Tregs which may modulate Th1/Th2 imbalance by suppressing Th2 response (from Th2 polarity toward a Th1 dominant response)."
2012,22953807,Berry components inhibit α-glucosidase in vitro: synergies between acarbose and polyphenols from black currant and rowanberry.,"Polyphenol-rich extracts from certain berries inhibited α-glucosidase activity in vitro. The two most effective berry extracts, from black currant and rowanberry, inhibited α-glucosidase with IC(50) values respectively of 20 and 30μg GAE/ml and were as effective as the pharmaceutical inhibitor, acarbose. These berry extracts differed greatly in their polyphenol composition: black currant was dominated by anthocyanins (∼70% of total) whereas rowanberry was enriched in chlorogenic acids (65% total) and had low levels of anthocyanins. Both black currant and rowanberry extracts potentiated the inhibition caused by acarbose and could replace the inhibition lost by reducing the acarbose dose. However, no additive effects were noted when black currant and rowanberry extracts were added in combination. The mechanisms underlying the synergy between acarbose and the berry polyphenols and the lack of synergy between the berry components are discussed. These extracts exhibited the potential to replace acarbose (or reduce the dose required) in its current clinical use in improving post-prandial glycaemic control in type 2 diabetics. As a result, these polyphenols may offer a dietary means for type 2 diabetics to exercise glycaemic control."

It is the only treatment which can decrease mortality in relation with AF. It can also prevent the first cause of dependency in elderly: stroke. Vitamin K antagonists are the more potent drugs to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patient with AF. Aspirin, unfractioned heparine or low molecular weight heparin and thienopyridine can also play a role in the antithrombotic therapy in special situations."
2013,24499201,Attenuating effect of standardized fruit extract of Punica granatum L in rat model of tibial and sural nerve transection induced neuropathic pain.,"Injury to a nerve is the most common reason of acquired peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, searching for effective substance to recover of nerve after injury is need of present era. The current study investigates the protective potential of Standardized Fruit Extract of Punica granatum L (PFE) [Ellagic acid (41.6%), Punicalagins (10%), Granatin (5.1%)] in Tibial & Sural Nerve Transection (TST) induced neuropathic pain in rats.TST was performed by sectioning tibial and sural nerve portions of the sciatic nerve and leaving the common peroneal nerve intact. Acetone drop, pin-prick, hot plate, paint brush & Walking Track tests were performed to assess cold allodynia; mechanical heat, hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia & tibial functional index respectively. The levels of TNF-α, TBARS, GSH and Nitrite were measured in the sciatic nerve as an index of inflammation & oxidative stress.TST led to significant development of cold allodynia; mechanical and heat hyperalgesia; dynamic mechanical allodynia; functional deficit in walking along with rise in the levels of TBARS, TNF-α, GSH and Nitrite. Administrations of PFE (100 & 300 mg/kg oral), significantly attenuate TST induced behavioral & biochemical changes. Pretreatments of BADGE (120 mg/kg IP) a PPAR-γ antagonist and nitric oxide precursor L-arginine (100 mg/kg IP) abolished the protective effect of PFE. Whereas, pretreatment of L-NAME (5 mg/kg IP) a NOS inhibitor significantly potentiated PFE's protective effect of PFE.PFE shown to have attenuating effect in TST induced neuropathic pain which may be attributed to potential PPAR-gamma agonistic activity, nitric oxide inhibitory, anti-inflammatory and anti oxidative actions."
1988,3177433,"Treatment of the anemia of predialysis patients with recombinant human erythropoietin: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) was administered in two phases to 12 patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances of 0.17-0.51 ml/second [10-30 ml/minute]) and uremic anemia. In addition to the routine tests done as part of a multicenter clinical trial, our patients had serial red cell mass measurements, quantitation of bone marrow stem cells, and marrow cytogenetic analysis. During the first eight weeks (acute phase), an equal number of patients was randomized to placebo or one of three doses of r-HuEPO (50, 100 or 150 unit/kg intravenously three times weekly). All three patients receiving 150 unit/kg responded by increasing their packed cell volume (PCV) to the normal range within eight weeks. There were lesser responses in PCV at the two lower doses of r-HuEPO and no response in the placebo group. The 51Cr red cell mass also increased significantly in a dose-related manner in patients receiving r-HuEPO but did not change in the placebo group. Marrow studies revealed increases in erythroid, megakaryocyte, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells in those patients on r-HuEPO, but no mutagenic effects were seen. Subsequently, ten patients received open label r-HuEPO. During this maintenance phase, all ten achieved or maintained a normal PCV. Several adverse events occurred, but none were definitely linked to r-HuEPO. Recombinant human erythropoietin is an effective and potent treatment of anemia caused by renal failure."
2008,18023427,N-Alkoxy derivatization of indole-3-carbinol increases the efficacy of the G1 cell cycle arrest and of I3C-specific regulation of cell cycle gene transcription and activity in human breast cancer cells.,"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring component of Brassica vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, induces a G1 cell cycle arrest of human breast cancer cells. Structure-activity relationships of I3C that mediate this anti-proliferative response were investigated using synthetic and natural I3C derivatives that contain substitutions at the indole nitrogen. Nitrogen substitutions included N-alkoxy substituents of one to four carbons in length, which inhibit dehydration and the formation of the reactive indolenine. Analysis of growth and cell cycle arrest of indole-treated human breast cancer cells revealed a striking increase in efficacy of the N-alkoxy I3C derivatives that is significantly enhanced by the presence of increasing carbon lengths of the N-alkoxy substituents. Compared to I3C, the half maximal growth arrest responses occurred at 23-fold lower indole concentration for N-methoxy I3C, 50-fold lower concentration for N-ethoxy I3C, 217-fold lower concentration for N-propoxy I3C, and 470-fold lower concentration for N-butoxy I3C. At these lower concentrations, each of the N-alkoxy substituted compounds induced the characteristic I3C response in that CDK6 gene expression, CDK6 promoter activity, and CDK2 specific enzymatic activity for its retinoblastoma protein substrate were strongly down-regulated. 3-Methoxymethylindole and 3-ethoxymethylindole were approximately as bioactive as I3C, whereas both tryptophol and melatonin failed to induce the cell cycle arrest, showing the importance of the C-3 hydroxy methyl substituent on the indole ring. Taken together, our study establishes the first I3C structure-activity relationship for cytostatic activities, and implicates I3C-based N-alkoxy derivatives as a novel class of potentially more potent experimental therapeutics for breast cancer."
2006,16999937,Cryptotanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE has an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 production and HASMC migration via down-regulated NF-kappaB and AP-1.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2) production and smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration may play key roles in the phathogenesis of neointima formation and atherosclerosis. Especially inducible MMP-9 expression was directly involved in the cancer cell invasion and SMC migration through vascular wall. In this study, we reveal that cryptotanshinone (CT) purified from Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE had an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 production and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells treated with TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. The down regulation of transcription of MMP-9 mRNA was evidenced by RT-PCR and MMP-9 promoter assay using luciferase reporter gene. Eletrophoretic mobility shift assay showed NF-kappaB and AP-1 nuclear translocations were suppressed. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2, p38 and JNK MAP kinase signaling pathways were inhibited. From the results, it is suggested that CT has anti-atherosclerosis and anti-neointimal formation activity."
2014,25022246,The protective effect of Physalis peruviana L. against cadmium-induced neurotoxicity in rats.,"The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of Physalis peruviana L. (family Solanaceae) against cadmium-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 was used as control. Group 2 was intraperitoneally injected with 6.5 mg/kg bwt of cadmium chloride for 5 days. Group 3 was treated with 200 mg/kg bwt of methanolic extract of Physalis (MEPh). Group 4 was pretreated with MEPh 1 h before cadmium for 5 days. Cadmium treatment induced marked disturbances in neurochemical parameters as indicating by significant (p < 0.05) reduction in dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex and enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) the levels of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide in the brain. Cadmium treatment also decreased the amount of nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants significantly (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with MEPh resulted in significant (p < 0.05) decreases in lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels and restored the amount of glutathione successfully. Although, preadministration of MEPh also brought the activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase significantly (p < 0.05) to the control levels, as well as the levels of Ca(2+), Cl(-), DA, 5-HT, and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA. These data indicated that Physalis has a beneficial effect in ameliorating the cadmium-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in the brain of rats."
1995,7575743,Myocardial effects of flavonoids from Crataegus species.,"The influence of the main flavonoids from Crataegus species (hawthorn, Rosaceae) on coronary flow, heart rate and left ventricular pressure as well as on the velocity of contraction and relaxation was investigated in Langendorff perfused isolated guinea pig hearts at a constant pressure of 70 cmH2O. Drug action was evaluated in a concentration range of 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-4) mol/l. An increase of coronary flow caused by the O-glycosides luteolin-7-glucoside (186%), hyperoside (66%) and rutin (66%) as well as an increase of the relaxation velocity (positive lusitropism) by luteolin-7-glucoside (104%), hyperoside (62%) and rutin (73%) were the major effects observed at a maximum concentration of 0.5 mmol/l. Furthermore, slight positive inotropic effects and a rise in heart rate were seen. Similar but less intensive actions were found with the C-glycosides vitexin, vitexin-rhamnoside and monoacetyl-vitexin-rhamnoside. Possible beta-adrenergic activities of the flavonoids could be excluded by the addition of propranolol in fixed concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/l. Moreover, pretreatment of the animals with reserpine (7 mg/kg) did not influence myocardial activity of hyperoside (10(-4) mol/l). As previous experiments showed an inhibition of the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase, the results suggest an inhibition of this enzyme as the possible underlying mechanism of cardiac action of flavonoids from Crataegus species."
2000,11020457,"Synergy between ethanol and grape polyphenols, quercetin, and resveratrol, in the inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase pathway.","In atherosclerosis and tumor initiation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated in the damage of vascular walls and DNA, respectively. Moderate consumption of red wine has been ascribed as a preventive for coronary heart disease; however, there has been much debate over whether the beneficial effect is from grape polyphenolic components or ethanol. We studied the interaction of grape compounds on nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages, mediators of blood vessel damage in atherosclerosis. For the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma led to expression of the iNOS gene and production of NO. The polyphenols quercetin and resveratrol at a micromolar range suppressed iNOS gene expression and NO production, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nitrite assay. The polyphenols were also found to be scavengers of NO in an acellular system using sodium nitroprusside under physiological conditions. Ethanol, at a moderate level, did not produce any appreciable level of reduction of iNOS or NO activity. However, its presence at 0.1 to 0.75% enhanced the effect of grape polyphenols concentration-dependently. Thus, the interaction between these components plays a significant role in the health effects of red wine, especially with respect to their effect on the NO pathway."
2014,24642711,Enhanced noscapine delivery using estrogen-receptor-targeted nanoparticles for breast cancer therapy.,"Noscapine (Nos), an orally available plant-derived antitussive alkaloid, is in phase II clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy. It has extensively been shown to inhibit tumor growth in nude mice bearing human xenografts of hematopoietic, breast, lung, ovarian, brain, and prostate origin. However, high tumor-suppressive Nos dosages encumber the development of oral controlled-release formulations because of a short biological half-life (<2 h), poor absorption, low aqueous solubility, and extensive first-pass metabolism. Here, we present the design, fabrication, optimization, characterization, and biological evaluation of estrone-conjugated noscapine-loaded gelatin nanoparticles (Nos-ES-GN) for targeting estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Gelatin nanoparticles (GN) were a uniformly compact size, stable at physiological pH, and showed a drug entrapment efficiency of 66.1±5.9 and 65.2±5.6% for Nos-GN and Nos-ES-GN, respectively. The secondary structure of gelatin nanocoacervates was predicted using circular dichroism and in-silico molecular modeling. Our data suggest that ethanol-fabricated GN retained the α-helical content of gelatin, whereas acetone favored the formation of random coils. The conjugation of estrone to Nos-GN did not affect the release rate of the drug, and both formulations followed first-order release kinetics with an initial burst, followed by a slow release. The IC50 value of Nos-ES-GN was 21.2 μmol/l, which was ∼50% lower than the free drug (43.3 μmol/l), suggesting targeted drug delivery. Our cell uptake study carried out in an estrogen-receptor-positive (MCF-7) and negative (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines showed greater accumulation of Nos-ES-GN in MCF-7 cells instead of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data indicated that estrone-conjugated nanoparticles may potentially be used for targeting breast cancer cells. "
2008,18005478,Phaseolin type and heat treatment influence the biochemistry of protein digestion in the rat intestine.,"The study aimed to investigate the in vivo digestion of Phaseolus vulgaris phaseolin types differing in their subunit pattern composition. Diets contained either casein as the sole source of protein or a mixture (1:1) of casein and pure Sanilac (S), Tendergreen (T) or Inca (I) phaseolin either unheated or heated. Rats were fed for 11 d with the experimental diets. Their ileal content and mucosa were collected and prepared for electrophoresis, Western blotting, densitometry and MS. Differences in digestion among native phaseolin types were observed for intact phaseolin at molecular weights (MW) of 47-50.5 kDa and for an undigested fragment at MW of 19-21.5 kDa in ileal digesta. In both cases, the concentration of these protein bands was lower for I phaseolin than for S or T phaseolin (P < 0.05). In the mucosa, the concentration of a protein band at MW of 20.5-21.5 kDa was lower for S phaseolin as compared to T or I phaseolin (P < 0.001). The presence of phaseolin subunits and their fragments was confirmed by Western blotting. MS analysis revealed the presence of undigested alpha and beta subunit fragments from phaseolin and endogenous proteins (anionic trypsin I and pancreatic alpha-amylase) in ileal digesta. Thermal treatment improved digestion (P < 0.01), acting on both dietary and endogenous protein components. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for differences in intestinal digestion among phaseolin types, S phaseolin being more resistant and I phaseolin more susceptible. These differences were affected by the origin of the phaseolin subunit precursor. Heat treatment enhanced phaseolin digestion."
2006,16946499,"Inhibitory effects of Korean red ginseng and its genuine constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 in mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and contact dermatitis models.","The inhibitory effects of the Korean red ginseng (steamed root of Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER, family Araliaceae) saponin fraction (KRGS) and its constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 in mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and contact dermatitis models were measured. Orally administered KRGS and its genuine ginsenosides potently inhibited the PCA reaction induced by IgE. However, when these ginsenosides were intraperitoneally administered, ginsenoside Rh2 showed the most potent inhibition. The ginsenoside Rh2 also the most potently inhibited the beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE with antigen. KRGS administered topically at a dose of 0.1% suppressed ear swelling in an oxazolone-induced mouse contact dermatitis model by 38.8%. Its constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 at a concentration of 0.05% also potently suppressed mouse ear swelling by 47.5%, 34.8%, and 49.9% at 16 d, respectively. These ginsenosides also significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma induced by oxazolone applied to mouse ears. However, the ginsenosides, except for ginsenoside Rh2, almost did not notably reduce IL-4 levels. The ginsenoside Rh2 also potently inhibited COX-2 and inducible NO synthetase protein expression in liphopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Based on these findings, KRGS and its ginsenosides are suggested to improve atopic and contact dermatitis by regulating expression of cytokines."
2007,17640417,Contents of conjugated linoleic acid isomers in ruminant-derived foods and estimation of their contribution to daily intake in Portugal.,"The present study provides a detailed overview of the contents of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers in the most consumed Portuguese CLA-rich foods (milk, butter, yoghurt, cheese, beef and lamb meat), by using silver ion-HPLC. In addition, the contribution of these ruminant-derived foods to the daily intake of CLA isomers was estimated based on Portuguese consumption habits. The total CLA concentration in milk and dairy products ranged from 4.00 mg/g fat in yoghurt to 7.22 mg/g fat in butter, and, regarding meats, from 4.45 mg/g fat in intensively produced beef to 11.29 mg/g fat in lamb meat. The predominant CLA isomers identified in these products were cis-9, trans-11 (59.89-79.21 %) and trans-7, cis-9 (8.04-20.20 %). The average estimated total CLA intake for the Portuguese population was 73.70 mg/d. Milk and cheese are probably the two products with the highest contribution to the final CLA intake, as a result of their high fat content and consumption values. The results also suggested that cis-9, trans-11 and trans-7, cis-9 are the isomers most represented, with, respectively, 76.10 and 12.56 % of the total CLA intake. Being the first detailed report on the contents of total and individual CLA isomers in Portuguese commercial ruminant-derived foods, we further discuss the implication of the results for diet characteristics and human health."
2003,12785735,Anti-Aspergillus activities of plant essential oils and their combination effects with ketoconazole or amphotericin B.,"The essential oils from Cedrus atlantica, Styrax tonkinensis, Juniperus communis, Lavandula angustifolia, Melaleuca alternifolia, Pelargonium graveolens, Pogesternon patchouli and Rosmarinus officinalis were analyzed by GC-MS. Antifungal activities of the oils were investigated by disk diffusion assay and the broth dilution method against Aspergillus niger and A. flavus. The effects of geraniol and the essential oil fraction from P. graveolens on the antifungal activity of amphotericin B and ketoconazole were examined using a checkerboard microtiter assay against both Aspergillus fungi. Most of the tested essential oils, with the exception of C. atlantica, J. communis, and P. patchouli, significantly inhibited growth of A. niger and to a lesser extent that of A. flavus, with MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) in the range 0.78-12.5 mg/mL. The essential oil fraction of P. graveolens and its main components, geraniol and citronellol, exhibited additive effects with amphotericin B and with ketoconazole against both Aspergillus species, resulting in fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices ranging from 0.52 to 1.00."
2005,16042075,The anticoagulant fraction from the leaves of Diospyros kaki L. has an antithrombotic activity.,"The leaves of Persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) has long been used for tea in Korea since it was thought to be effective against hypertension. An anticoagulant fraction was purified through gel filtration G-100, hydrophobic, gel filtration G-150, and FPLC, Phenyl superpose column chromatographies. The purified fraction was homogenous and its Mr was estimated 10,000 Da by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. The purified fraction was sensitive to treatment of subtilisin B, but not to heat and its activity was not changed after periodate oxidation, indicating that the activity was not due to carbohydrates. It delayed thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and prothrombin time (PT) using human plasma. TT was more sensitive than APTT and PT, suggesting that the anticoagulant activity may be caused by a degradation or a defect of fibrin or thrombin. It did not cause the hydrolysis of fibrin after incubation. However, it inhibited thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation with a competitive inhibition pattern. These results indicate that it may be an antithrombotic agent and that it is bound to fibrinogen binding sites of thrombin."
2019,30902543,Adefovir accumulation and nephrotoxicity in renal interstitium: Role of organic anion transporters of kidney.,"Common characteristics of drug induced nephrotoxicity are renal tubular and interstitial injury. Many studies have only focused on renal tubular injury. However, less is known about the effects of drugs in the renal interstitium on the nephrotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of adefovir (ADV) and the nephrotoxicity in the renal interstitium. Rats were treated with ADV alone or in combination with probenecid for 1, 7, 14, or 28 days. The renal interstitial fluid was collected by renal microdialysis. The concentration of ADV was determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Nephrotoxicity was evaluated by biochemical parameters or histological analysis. The results showed that organic anion transporters (OATs) inhibitor probenecid significantly increased the area under concentration-time curves (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) of ADV in the renal interstitium, while the clearance (CL) in the renal interstitium was decreased in the ADV plus probenecid group compared to the ADV groups. After long-term treatment, interstitial fibrosis was present in the ADV plus probenecid group, whereas no trace of that could be detected in the ADV groups. Furthermore, a decrease was observed in the expression of OATs/Oats, which was dependent upon the concentrations and time of ADV treatment. In conclusion, it is possible that ADV could be accumulated in the interstitium when Oats were inhibited, which could cause renal interstitial fibrosis. Simply reducing cell uptake in long-term treatment might not be an effective method to protect against chronic nephrotoxicity."
,17352225,Tumor-specificity and type of cell death induced by trihaloacetylazulenes in human tumor cell lines.,"Twenty trihaloacetylazulene derivatives with one atom of fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine was investigated for their tumor-specific cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity against three human normal cells (gingival fibroblast, HGF; pulp cell, HPC; periodontal ligament fibroblast, HPLF) and four human tumor cell lines (squamous cell carcinoma, HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4; promyelocytic leukemia, HL-60). There was no apparent difference in the cytotoxic activity between 2-methoxyazulenes [1a-1e, 2a-2e] and 2-ethoxyazulenes [3a-3e, 4a-4e]. Trichloroacetylazulenes [2a-2e, 4a-4e] generally showed higher cytotoxicity and tumor-specificity (expressed as a TS value) as compared with the corresponding trifluoroacetylazulenes [1a-1e, 3a-3e]. Substitution of chloride [1c, 2c, 3c. 4c], bromide [1d, 2d, 3d, 4d] or iodine [1e, 2e, 3e, 4e] at the C-3 position further enhanced cytotoxic activity against four tumor cell lines, especially HL-60 cells. Among twenty trihaloacetylazulene derivatives, two compounds [2d] and [4c] showed the highest tumor specificity (TS = > 3.5 and > 2.5, respectively). Compounds [2d] and [4c] induced apoptotic cell death characterized by caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, compounds [2d] and [4c] induced autophagic cell death characterized by lower activation of caspases, lack of DNA fragmentation, vacuolization and autophagosome formation detected by acridine orange and LC3-GFP fluorescence, without the decline of the intracellular concentration of three major polyamines in HSC-4 cells. The cytotoxic activity of [4c], but not [2d], was slightly reduced by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy. These results suggest the diversity of cell death type induced in human tumor cell lines by trihaloacetylazulene derivatives."
2013,23993558,NADH induces iron release from pea seed ferritin: a model for interaction between coenzyme and protein components in foodstuffs.,"Plant ferritin from legume seeds co-exists with coenzyme NADH (a reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide) in many foodstuffs. In the present study, the interaction of NADH with apo pea seed ferritin (PSF) was investigated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence titration, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We found that NADH molecules bound on the outer surface of PSF close to the 4-fold channels, which was 1.58 nm from tryptophan residue (Trp). Consequently, such binding facilitates iron release from holo PSF, which might have a negative effect on PSF as an iron supplement, while NADH was oxidised into NAD(+). However, the binding of NADH to the protein does not affect the entry of toxic ferrous ions into the apo protein shell, where these ferrous ions were oxidised into less toxic ferric ions. Moreover, NADH binding markedly affects the tertiary structure around Trp residues of PSF. These findings advanced our understanding of the interactions between different naturally occurring components in a complex food system."
2015,26289125,"Antidepressant-Like Effects of Sanggenon G, Isolated from the Root Bark of Morus alba, in Rats: Involvement of the Serotonergic System.","The root bark of Morus alba is commonly used as an alternative medicine due to its numerous health benefits in humans. However, the antidepressant effects of various active components from M. alba have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we aimed to determine whether sanggenon G, an active compound isolated from the root bark of M. alba, exhibited antidepressant-like activity in rats subjected to forced swim test (FST)-induced depression. Acute treatment of rats with sanggenon G (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) significantly reduced immobility time and increased swimming time without any significant change in climbing. Rats treated with sanggenon G also exhibited a decrease in the limbic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to the FST, as indicated by attenuation of the corticosterone response and decreased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In addition, the antidepressant-like effects of sanggenon G were significantly inhibited by WAY100635 (1 mg/kg, i.p.; a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist), but not SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.; a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist). Our findings suggested that the antidepressant-like effects of sanggenon G were mediated by an interaction with the serotonergic system. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential of sanggenon G as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression. "
2006,16495667,Inhibitory effects of hot water extract of the Stevia stem on the contractile response of the smooth muscle of the guinea pig ileum.,"The effects of a hot water extract of the stem of Stevia rebaudiana on the smooth muscle of isolated guinea pig ileum were investigated. The butyl alcohol layer of the extract antagonized the contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum induced by histamine (1 x 10(-5) M) and acetylcholine (1 x 10(-5) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. The butyl alcohol layer of the extract also showed inhibition of CaCl(2) (1 x 10(-3)-3.8 x 10(-1) M)-induced contractions. The antagonism of the extract was considered to be non-specific, but this action might be related to an influx of extracellular Ca(2+). With column chromatography preparation, the active component was assumed to be as stevioside. The antagonistic effects exerted by the stem extract of Stevia rebaudiana contributed to the gastroprotective activity of the extract in animals fed dietary histamine."
2018,30010030,Antiproliferative and antimetastatic properties of 3-benzyloxy-16-hydroxymethylene-estradiol analogs against breast cancer cell lines.,"Despite emerging new therapeutic opportunities, cancer is still a major health problem and a leading cause of death worldwide. Breast tumors are the most frequently diagnosed female malignancies, and the triple-negative subtype is associated with poorer prognosis and lower survival rates than other breast cancer types. The aims of the present study were to determine the anticancer potency of a set of C-3 and C-16 modified estradiol-derivatives against a panel of breast cancer cell lines, and to characterize the mechanism of action of two selected compounds (1 and 5) against the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Growth-inhibitory properties were investigated by an MTT-assay. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry has revealed G1 phase accumulation and indicated the proapoptotic effect of 1 and 5 through the elevation of the apoptotic subG1 phase on MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h treatment. The antimetastatic activities of these compounds were examined by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays, and both compounds were shown to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells at sub-antiproliferative concentrations. Gelatin zymography assay has indicated that matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 are not involved in the antimetastatic action of the molecules. Western blot analysis was performed with 24 h incubation to examine the possible changes in the level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and both compounds were found to inhibit the phosphorylation of FAK in a concentration-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of this study demonstrate that C-3 and C-16 modified estradiol derivatives are potent antiproliferative and antimetastatic compounds against a triple-negative breast cancer cell line with a mechanism of action involving the inhibition of FAK, a novel anticancer therapeutic target. Therefore, these findings can be utilized in the development of promising anticancer agents with steroid skeleton."
,17970079,Flash wave light strongly enhanced the cytocidal effect of photodynamic therapy with acridine orange on a mouse osteosarcoma cell line.,"A photodynamic therapy technique with acridine orange (AO-PDT) was experimentally developed and applied clinically to musculoskeletal sarcoma patients to reduce the surgical margin and obtain good limb function. Furthermore, various modalities to enhance and strengthen the cytocidal effect of AO-PDT were investigated. A recent report revealed that the use of stronger unfiltered xenon light in AO-PDT enhanced the cytocidal efficacy of this treatment modality. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the use of a flash wave light (FWL) from a xenon lamp, as compared to that of the conventional continuous wave light (CWL), might enhance the cytocidal effect of AO-PDT, using the mouse osteosarcoma cell line, LM8. For an equal energy dose (79.6 joules/cm2), AO-PDT using FWL (10 minutes excitation) was found to exert a significantly stronger cytocidal effect than that using CWL (18 seconds excitation). For the same excitation time (10 minutes' excitation), the use of FWL (79.6 jouleslcm2) was associated with a significantly stronger cytocidal effect of AO-PDT than that of CWL (3,820 joules/cm2). These results reveal that the use of FWL entails the need for a lower excitation energy and shorter excitation time than that of CWL for the cytocidal effect of AO-PDT to be observed against the osteosarcoma cells. In addition, FWL also has the advantage of generating low heat and of having the ability to homogenously illuminate a wider area. We therefore concluded that FWL is more useful for AO-PDT than CWL in terms of saving on the excitation time and of obtaining good efficacy of destruction of the residual tumor in the treatment of musculoskeletal sarcomas."
2016,26615121,Antihepatotoxic efficacy of Mangifera indica L. polysaccharides against cyclophosphamide in rats.,"The present study aims to evaluate the possible protective role of polysaccharides extracted from the Egyptian mango Mangifera indica L. (MPS) and/or silymarine against cyclophosphamide (CP) toxicity in male albino rats. The MPS and/or silymarin significantly decreased the activities of serum ASAT and ALAT. However, MPS (1000 mg/kg) normalized their activities towards the normal levels recording 28.75 and 78.75 U/ml respectively. The recorded data also showed the antioxidant effect of MPS by decreasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as normalized the activities of the antioxidant enzyme GST and SOD. Histopathological examinations also confirmed the protective efficacy of MPS against liver toxicity of CP. In conclusion, the recorded results of the present study support the protective role of MPS and/or silymarin against CP-induced hepatic damage."
2018,28873524,Pyridinium ionic liquid-based liquid-solid extraction of inorganic and organic iodine from Laminaria.,"A simple, green and effective extraction method, namely, pyridinium ionic liquid- (IL) based liquid-solid extraction (LSE), was first designed to extract the main inorganic and organic iodine compounds (I-, monoiodo-tyrosine (MIT) and diiodo-tyrosine (DIT)). The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: ultrasonic intensity 100W, IL ([EPy]Br) concentration 200mM, extraction time 30min, liquid/solid ratio 10mL/g, and pH value 6.5. The morphologies of Laminaria were studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The recovery values of I-, MIT and DIT from Laminaria were in the range of 88% to 94%, and limits of detection were in the range of 59.40 to 283.6ng/g. The proposed method was applied to the extraction and determination of iodine compounds in three Laminaria. The results showed that IL-based LSE could be a promising method for rapid extraction of bioactive iodine from complex food matrices."
2004,15461622,A phase 2 study of two doses of bortezomib in relapsed or refractory myeloma.,"In a phase 2 open-label study of the novel proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, 54 patients with multiple myeloma who had relapsed after or were refractory to frontline therapy were randomized to receive intravenous 1.0 or 1.3 mg/m(2) bortezomib twice weekly for 2 weeks, every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. Dexamethasone was permitted in patients with progressive or stable disease after two or four cycles respectively. Responses were determined using modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria. The complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) rate for bortezomib alone was 30% [90% confidence interval (CI), 15.7-47.1] and 38% (90% CI, 22.6-56.4) in the 1.0 mg/m(2) (8 of 27 patients) and 1.3 mg/m(2) (10 of 26 patients) groups respectively. The CR + PR rate for patients who received bortezomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone was 37% and 50% for the 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m(2) cohorts respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (24%), neutropenia (17%), lymphopenia (11%) and peripheral neuropathy (9%). Grade 4 events were observed in 9% (five of 54 patients). Bortezomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone demonstrated therapeutic activity in patients with multiple myeloma who relapsed after frontline therapy."
,12014677,Vitamins B6 and C and mitomycin C-efficiency under irradiation.,"The radiation-induced effect of Vitamin B6 (Vit. B6) on mitomycin C (MMC) was investigated by using Escherichia coli bacteria AB 1157 as a model in air-free media as well as in media saturated with nitrous oxide (N20) or air, respectively. In all three types of media Vit.B6 showed cytostatic abilities. The highest synergistic effect of Vit.B6 on MMC was observed in an air-free environment. It decreased 2.8-fold in aerated solution and showed the opposite effect in solutions saturated with N20. The addition of Vitamin C (Vit.C) to the Vit.B6/MMC-mixture in air-free media reduced the MMC-efficiency by a factor of 3.6, whereas the presence of air led to a MMC enhancement of 1.6-fold. Considerations based on the involvement of the primary transients of water radiolysis were made in order to explain the observed effects."
2006,16595910,Phenolic constituents of Malus doumeri var. formosana in the field of skin care.,"Plant phenolic compounds isolated from a 70% aqueous acetone extract of the leaves of Malus doumeri A. CHEV. var. formosana (KAWAK. & KOIDZ.) S. S. YING, a type of Taiwanese indigenous plant, were evaluated for potential application in the field of skin care. A phytochemical investigation of the active fractions resulted in the isolation of seven compounds of which the structures were identified by spectroscopic characterization. In the present study, the isolated phenolic compounds were evaluated for their free radical-scavenging activities against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the superoxide radicals, anti-elastase, and for their anti-matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity in human skin fibroblast cells. Of these compounds, 3-hydroxyphloridzin (2), 3-hydroxyphloretin (6), and quercetin (7) exhibited the strongest DPPH and superoxide radical-scavenging activities. The IC50 values of these compounds were 9.2, 7.7, and 15.4 microM, respectively, for the DPPH radical, and 25.0, 19.6, and 42.6 microM, respectively, for the superoxide radical. 3-Hydroxyphloridzin (2) and 3-hydroxyphloretin (6) also showed xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values of 52.1 and 22.4 muM, respectively. In the test for elastase inhibitory activity, phloretin (5) and 3-hydroxyphloretin (6) were the most potent compounds. Phloretin (5), 3-hydroxyphloretin (6), and quercetin (7) showed better inhibition of MMP-1 production in fibroblast cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the active phenolic compounds from M. doumeri var. formosana have been isolated, reported, and described. The above results suggest that the extract of M. doumeri var. formosana containing phenolic compounds could be suitable naturally occurring active constituents for use in anti-aging or cosmetic products."
1998,9784772,"Stability of alprazolam, chloroquine phosphate, cisapride, enalapril maleate, and hydralazine hydrochloride in extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.","The stability of five drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied. Alprazolam 1 mg/mL, chloroquine phosphate 15 mg/mL, cisapride 1 mg/mL, enalapril maleate 1 mg/mL, and hydralazine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL were each prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus, and cherry syrup and placed in 120-mL amber clear polyethylene terephthalate bottles. Three bottles of each liquid were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. Samples were taken initially and at various times up to 60 days for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography and assessment of appearance and odor; pH was measured. A mean of at least 91% of the initial drug concentration was retained for 60 days in the alprazolam, chloroquine phosphate, cisapride, and enalapril maleate liquids. The hydralazine hydrochloride liquids retained more than 90% of the initial concentration for only one day at 5 degrees C when prepared with Ora-Sweet-Ora-Plus and two days when prepared with Ora-Sweet SF-Ora-Plus and for less than a day in these preparations at 25 degrees C and in cherry syrup at 5 and 25 degrees C. No substantial changes in the appearance, odor, or pH of any liquid were observed. Alprazolam 1 mg/mL, chloroquine phosphate 15 mg/mL, cisapride 1 mg/mL, and enalapril maleate 1 mg/mL were stable in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids for 60 days at 5 and 25 degrees C; hydralazine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL was stable at 5 degrees C for one day in Ora-Sweet-Ora Plus and for two days in Ora-Sweet SF-Ora-Plus."
1997,9174476,High dietary calcium intakes reduce zinc absorption and balance in humans.,"Optimal calcium intakes of 37.5 mmol(1500 mg)/d have been proposed for elderly people. We investigated the effects of calcium supplementation on zinc absorption and balance in 18 relatively healthy, postmenopausal women aged 59-86 y. All subjects received a standardized basal diet of typical foods supplying 269 mumol (17.6 mg) Zn/d and 22.2 mmol (890 mg) Ca/d during the 36-d study. In two of three experimental periods, an additional 11.7 mmol (468 mg) Ca/d as either milk or an inorganic calcium phosphate supplement was provided. Net zinc absorption and zinc balance were significantly reduced by approximately 2 mg/d during both high-calcium treatments. In a second study, conducted in a separate group of men and women aged 21-69 y, a whole-gut lavage, zinc-absorption test was used to investigate the acute effect of a 15-mmol CaCO3 (600 mg Ca) supplement, with and without extra zinc, on zinc absorption from a single test meal supplying 111.7 mumol (7.3 mg) Zn. Zinc absorption was reduced significantly by 50% when the calcium supplement was given with the meal. Inclusion of an extra 119.3 mumol (7.8 mg) Zn as part of a calcium supplement offset the detrimental effect of calcium on zinc absorption. Our findings suggest that high-calcium diets can reduce net zinc absorption and balance and may increase the zinc requirement in adult humans."
2006,16755009,Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions.,"The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity."
2018,29908166,Antineoplastic activity of mitomycin C formulated in nanoemulsions-based essential oils on HeLa cervical cancer cells.,"Combining the essential oils (ESSOs) with the chemotherapeutic agent, mitomycin C (MMC), in nanoparticle can be beneficial in cancer therapy. The aim of the current study was to in vitro evaluate the antineoplastic effect of MMC, formulated in two different nanoemulsions (NE) based on two ESSOs, chamomile (Ch) and garlic (Gar), on HeLa cervical cancer cells. The z-average diameter of Ch-NE has slightly increased from 83.39 ± 12.85 nm to 91.18 ± 5.79 nm when mixed with MMC (Ch-MMC) whereas the z-average diameter of Gar-NE has markedly increased from 50.6 ± 1.96 nm to 75.64 ± 7.13 nm when loaded with MMC (Gar-MMC). The zeta potentials of both of Ch-NE and Ch-MMC, which were -1.91 ± 4.38 mV and -5.44 ± 5.26 mV, respectively, have differed from Gar-NE and Gar-MMC, which were 11.4 ± 2.29 mV and 11.5 ± 2.28 mV, respectively. Compared to MMC solution, the cell viabilities of HeLa cells, measured by the MTT assay, were reduced 42 and 20 times when subjected into Ch-MMC and Gar-MMC, respectively. The light microscopy images revealed that the cell membrane of the HeLa cells treated with Gar-NE or Gar-MMC were more altered relative to the cells treated with Ch-NE or Ch-MMC. In contrast, the nuclei of the HeLa cells, stained with DAPI and treated with Ch-NE or Ch-MMC, were more fragmented than the cells treated with Gar-NE or Gar-MMC, indicating that both of Ch-NE and Ch-MMC have passed the cell membrane and affected the nucleus directly whereas Gar-NE and Gar-MMC have got attached to the cell membrane causing damage to the cell. In conclusion, combining MMC with NE-based ESSOs has increased the cytotoxic effect of the MMC on the HeLa cells with different mechanism of actions."
2017,28969623,Protective effects of methanolic extract of Juglans regia L. leaf on streptozotocin-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy in rats.,"Oxidative stress has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common and debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus. There is accumulating evidence that Juglans regia L. (GRL) leaf extract, a rich source of phenolic components, has hypoglycemic and antioxidative properties. This study aimed to determine the protective effects of Juglans regia L. leaf extract against streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy in rat.The DPN rat model was generated by intraperitoneal injection of a single 55 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin (STZ). A subset of the STZ-induced diabetic rats intragastically administered with GRL leaf extract (200 mg/kg/day) before or after the onset of neuropathy, whereas other diabetic rats received only isotonic saline as the same volume of GRL leaf extract. To evaluate the effects of GRL leaf extract on the diabetic neuropathy various parameters, including histopathology and immunohistochemistry of apoptotic and inflammatory factors were assessed along with nociceptive and biochemical assessments.Degeneration of the sciatic nerves which was detected in the STZ-diabetic rats attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration. Greater caspase-3, COX-2, and iNOS expression could be detected in the STZ-diabetic rats, which were significantly attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration. Also, attenuation of lipid peroxidation and nociceptive response along with improved antioxidant status in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats were detected after GRL leaf extract administration. In other word, GRL leaf extract ameliorated the behavioral and structural indices of diabetic neuropathy even after the onset of neuropathy, in addition to blood sugar reduction.Our results suggest that GRL leaf extract exert preventive and curative effects against STZ-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats which might be due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.

2012,22742899,Carbenoxolone prevents the development of fatty liver in C57BL/6-Lep ob/ob mice via the inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c activity and apoptosis.,"Carbenoxolone is the 3-hemisuccinate of glycyrrhetinic acid, the active principal of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). It was reported that carbenoxolone improved glucose tolerance with increased insulin sensitivity in mice with high fat diet-induced obesity. In the present study, we elucidated the protective effect of carbenoxolone in fatty liver animal models of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice through inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and apoptosis. In addition, the potential mechanisms by which carbenoxolone could exert such protection were elucidated. Carbenoxolone was daily administrated by gavage for 28 days in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Carbenoxolone prevented the plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation associated with the reduction of the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, liver X receptor, fatty acid synthase and acethyl-CoA carboxylase in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Carbenoxolone also prevented hepatic injury through anti-apoptotic action in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice, accompanied by increased Bcl-2 expression and suppressed Bax and cytochrome c expression. As a mechanism, increased inflammatory cytokine expressions were inhibited by carbenoxolone in the fatty livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Furthermore, carbenoxolone inhibited free fatty acid (oleate/palmitate) induced reactive oxygen species formation and reversed free fatty acid induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization in HepG2 cells. Carbenoxolone prevents the development of fatty liver by inhibiting sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c expression and activity with an anti-apoptotic mechanism via the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species formation in the livers of C57BL/6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. It is suggested that carbenoxolone prevents the development and progression of fatty liver disease in patients with insulin resistance."
2017,27464306,Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of carnosol and carnosic acid in vivo and in vitro and in silico analysis of their target interactions.,"The diterpenoids carnosol (CS) and carnosic acid (CA) from Salvia spp. exert prominent anti-inflammatory activities but their molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Here we investigated the effectiveness of CS and CA in inflammatory pain and the cellular interference with their putative molecular targets.The effects of CS and CA in different models of inflammatory pain were investigated. The inhibition of key enzymes in eicosanoid biosynthesis, namely microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) was confirmed by CS and CA, and we determined the consequence on the eicosanoid network in activated human primary monocytes and neutrophils. Molecular interactions and binding modes of CS and CA to target enzymes were analyzed by docking studies.CS and CA displayed significant and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in carrageenan-induced mouse hyperalgesia 4 h post injection of the stimuli, and also inhibited the analgesic response in the late phase of the formalin test. Moreover, both compounds potently inhibited cell-free mPGES-1 and 5-LO activity and preferentially suppressed the formation of mPGES-1 and 5-LO-derived products in cellular studies. Our in silico analysis for mPGES-1 and 5-LO supports that CS and CA are dual 5-LO/mPGES-1 inhibitors.In summary, we propose that the combined inhibition of mPGES-1 and 5-LO by CS and CA essentially contributes to the bioactivity of these diterpenoids. Our findings pave the way for a rational use of Salvia spp., traditionally used as anti-inflammatory remedy, in the continuous expanding context of nutraceuticals.This article is part of a themed section on Principles of Pharmacological Research of Nutraceuticals.

2018,28958520,The kinetics of oxygen and SO2 consumption by red wines. What do they tell about oxidation mechanisms and about changes in wine composition?,"This work seeks to understand the kinetics of O2 and SO2 consumption of air-saturated red wine as a function of its chemical composition, and to describe the chemical changes suffered during the process in relation to the kinetics. Oxygen Consumption Rates (OCRs) are faster with higher copper and epigallocatechin contents and with higher absorbance at 620nm and slower with higher levels of gallic acid and catechin terminal units in tannins. Acetaldehyde Reactive Polyphenols (ARPs) may be key elements determining OCRs. It is confirmed that SO2 is poorly consumed in the first saturation. Phenylalanine, methionine and maybe, cysteine, seem to be consumed instead. A low SO2 consumption is favoured by low levels of SO2, by a low availability of free SO2 caused by a high anthocyanin/tannin ratio, and by a polyphenolic profile poor in epigallocatechin and rich in catechin-rich tannins. Wines consuming SO2 efficiently consume more epigallocatechin, prodelphinidins and procyanidins."
2015,26089647,Protective effect of galangin in Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis in mice.,"Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The present study aims to reveal the effect of galangin on Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis (CIH), a well-established animal model of immune-mediated liver injury, and to clarify the related mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with galangin followed by ConA challenge. Results indicated that galangin inhibited ConA-induced liver damage. Mice pretreated with galangin showed more reduction of liver damage when compared with control mice pretreated with vehicle solution. In galangin-pretreated mice with induced CIH, increases in serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-12 were dramatically attenuated, and chemokines and adhesion molecules like interferon inducible protein-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, and inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 messenger RNA expressions in liver were decreased. Moreover, CIH mice pretreated with galangin showed less leukocyte infiltration and T-cell activation in the liver. Further, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of galangin may be attributed to its modulation of crucial inflammatory signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B and interferon-gamma/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. Collectively, these findings suggest the preventive and therapeutic potential of galangin in immune-mediated liver injury in vivo. "
1990,2206097,Effect of malnutrition and hormone treatments on intestinal microvillus membrane glycosylation in suckling rats.,"Imposition of undernutrition in suckling rats significantly enhanced (p less than 0.001) sialic acid and reduced (p less than 0.001) fucose contents of intestinal microvillus membranes (MVM) compared to the controls. Administration of cortisone or insulin to undernourished (UN) pups reversed the sialylation and fucosylation pattern of the membranes. The binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to membranes was increased (p less than 0.001) and that of Ulex europeus agglutinin (UEA) was decreased in nutritionally deprived pups. Cortisone and insulin treatments reduced WGA and enhanced UEA bindings to UN membranes. The binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA) to UN membranes was 60% higher compared to that in the control rats. Cortisone and insulin treatments further enhanced PNA binding to the brush borders in UN pups. The incorporation of 14C-GlcNAc, 14C-mannose and 3H-fucose into MVM was reduced by 32-57% in UN suckling rats compared to the controls. The incorporation of labelled sugars into membranes from 21- and 50- to 60-day-old rats was essentially similar. Cortisone administration to UN pups augmented the incorporation of labelled GlcNAc and mannose but had no effect on fucose incorporation. Insulin treatment of UN pups insignificantly elevated GlcNAc incorporation into the membranes. These findings suggest that imposition of UN during early suckling period delays the maturational development of intestinal glycosylation. Cortisone and insulin induced adult-type glycosylation pattern of the brush borders in nutritionally deprived pups."
1988,2451545,Antigenic phenotype and functional characterization of human tonsil B cells.,"Human tonsil cells were labeled with anti-leu-16, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that recognizes the CD20 antigen and that is specific for B cells. Two populations of B cells were identified by flow cytometry on the basis of antigen density. One labeled brightly with anti-Leu-16, and the other labeled at a level comparable to blood B cells. These two populations were characterized with a panel of MoAbs in two- and three-color flow cytometric studies and appeared to correspond to germinal-center and mantle-zone B cells. The pattern of staining of anti-Leu-16 on sections of frozen tonsil supported this characterization. Anti-Leu-16 labeled germinal center cells more intensely than mantle zone cells and stained a few scattered B cells in the interfollicular zone. The ability of each Leu-16+ population to secrete IgG and IgM in response to mitogens was measured in a particle immunofluorescence assay. Dim Leu-16+ B cells (small, resting B cells and a subpopulation of preactivated cells) secreted IgG and IgM in response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) but only IgG in response to B cell growth factor (BCGF). Bright Leu-16+ B cells (small to large activated cells and possibly memory cells) did not respond to PWM but secreted IgG in response to BCGF. The functional responses of dim Leu-16+ and bright Leu-16+ B cells were consistent with their identification as mantle-zone and germinal-center B cells. Phenotypic identification and functional studies of mantle-zone and germinal-center B cells may help clarify the differentiation pathway within the germinal center."
2010,21387793,[Fatal colchicine poisoning--case report and review of literature].,"Colchicine is a natural pseudo-alkaloid found in plants such as the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale) and glory lily (Gloriosa superba), which is used to treat gout and some other rheumatological disease. Colchicine binds to tubuline and prevents its polymerization into microtubules. It is thus able to impair those cellular functions that involve microtubules, eg. it arrests mitosis in metaphase. Tissues with high mitotic activity are preferentially affected. We report suicidal colchicine poisoning leading to death after 61 hours. Clinical course was typical for colchicine action. We observed severe diarrhea, cardiovascular shock, ARDS, multiorgan system failure and DIC. Postmortem toxicological studies confirm colchicine poisoning."
2009,18941913,"Coffee intake, variants in genes involved in caffeine metabolism, and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.","We evaluated whether genetic variability, as well as menopausal status, modify the association between coffee intake and risk of ovarian cancer. Risk factor information and biologic specimens from three large epidemiological studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the New England based Case-Control Study of ovarian cancer (NECC) were pooled resulting in 1,354 ovarian cancer cases and 1,851 controls for analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional (NHS/NHSII) and unconditional (NECC) logistic regression. Coffee consumption was not associated with overall risk (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.77-1.28); however, there was a suggested increased risk of ovarian cancer among premenopausal women in the NECC only and an inverse association among postmenopausal women. Carrying one or both of the variant CYP19013 A or CYP19027 G alleles was associated with an 18% increased (P for trend = 0.02) and 15% decreased (P for trend = 0.05) risk of ovarian cancer, respectively. Variation in CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP2A6 did not explain the inconsistent reports of coffee intake and risk. Furthermore, we did not observe any clear gene-environment interactions between caffeine metabolizing genes and ovarian cancer. Future studies evaluating mechanisms by which coffee mediates this relationship are warranted."
1998,9488626,Flow cytometric analysis of reticulated platelets: evidence for a large proportion of non-specific labelling of dense granules by fluorescent dyes.,"The labelling of platelets with thiazole orange (TO) has been utilized by various laboratories to determine the percentage of reticulated platelets within whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A proportion of TO labelling, however, is not entirely mRNA specific and remains to be fully defined. Almost half of the total TO-positive signal within normal platelets (n = 5) was shown to be abrogated upon degranulation with 80 microM thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) (P = 0.006), strongly suggesting that platelet granules are non-specifically labelling with dye. We have confirmed this hypothesis by studying TO labelling of platelets within whole blood from dense granule deficient patients, e.g. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) (n = 5) and storage pool disease (SPD) (n = 4). The levels of TO-positive platelets were found to be significantly lower than normal (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0002 respectively), but not significantly different from TRAP degranulated platelets. Upon degranulation of HPS and SPD platelets there was very little further reduction in the TO signal. Incubation of normals and SPD whole blood with different concentrations of either TO or coriphosphine-O confirmed that dense granules were non-specifically labelling even at high concentrations of both dyes. These findings suggest that although TO labelling is in part RNA specific, the dense granular pool of nucleotides appears to cause a substantial amount (approximately 50%) of non-specific labelling observed under these conditions of assay. This can easily be controlled for by a degranulation step with a non-enzymatic platelet agonist such as TRAP, and may have important consequences for the eventual standardization. clinical utilization and automation of reticulated platelet assays."
2014,24067745,Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolic activation of clopidogrel.,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, participate in the bioactivation of clopidogrel. Grapefruit juice constituents potently inactivate intestinal CYP3A4 and have been shown to inhibit CYP2C19 as well. In a randomized crossover study, 14 healthy volunteers ingested 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water three times daily for 3 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 600-mg dose of clopidogrel. Grapefruit juice reduced the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of the active metabolite of clopidogrel to 13% of the control (range 11-17%, P < 0.001) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 3 h to 14% (range 12-17%, P < 0.001) of the control, but it had no significant effect on the parent clopidogrel. Moreover, grapefruit juice markedly decreased the platelet-inhibitory effect of clopidogrel, as assessed with the VerifyNow P2Y12 test in two of the participants. In conclusion, concomitant use of grapefruit juice may impair the efficacy of clopidogrel. Therefore, the use of grapefruit juice is best avoided during clopidogrel therapy. "
2012,22270391,Tanshinone IIA in acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"The prognosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been significantly improved by the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). However, the utility of these drugs is limited by resistance to ATRA and the side effects of ATO. It has been reported that Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a diterpene quinone isolated from Salvia Miltiorrhiza Bunge, induces apoptosis in the APL cell line, NB4. The effect of Tan IIA on the ATRA-resistant APL cell line (MR2) is unknown.In this study, the effects of Tan IIA and ATO, alone and in combination, on MR2 cell apoptosis were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses.Nuclear changes typical of apoptosis were observed in Tan IIA-treated MR2 cells. Apoptosis was shown to be induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the activation of caspase-3 resulting in upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-a expression, activation of caspase-8 and alteration in mitochondrial transmembrane potential with release of cytochrome c (cyto-c). Tan IIA and ATO acted synergistically on the induction of MR2 cell apoptosis.These data indicate that Tan IIA may be beneficial in the treatment of ATRA-resistant APL and in combination with ATO for APL therapy in the clinic."
2005,16042077,Effects of Korean red ginseng extract on cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting.,"Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is well known as a tonic medicine for restoring and enhancing human health. In traditional medicine, ginseng is utilized for the alleviation of emesis, which includes nausea and vomiting. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether ginseng exhibits in vivo anti-nausea and anti-vomiting properties. In this study, we examined the anti-emetic effect of Korean red ginseng total extract (KRGE) on cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting using ferrets. Intraperitoneal administration (i.p.) of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) induced both nausea and vomiting with one-hour latency. The episodes of nausea and vomiting reached a peak after 1.5 h and persisted for 3 h. Treatment with KRGE via oral route significantly reduced the cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-emetic effect was 12.7 +/- 8.6, 31.8 +/- 6.9, and 67.6 +/- 4.0% with doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 g/kg of KRGE, respectively. Pretreatment with KRGE via oral route 1 and 2 h before cisplatin administration also significantly attenuated the cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. However this did not occur with a pretreatment 4 h before cisplatin administration. These results are supportive of KRGE being utilized as an anti-emetic agent against nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (i.e. cisplatin)."
2019,31169033,Oleuropein modulates glioblastoma miRNA pattern different from Olea europaea leaf extract.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and deadliest subtype of glioma. Despite current innovations in existing therapeutic modalities, GBM remains incurable, and alternative therapies are required. Previously, we demonstrated that Olea europaea leaf extract (OLE) kills GBM cells by modulating miR-181b, miR-137, miR-153 and Let-7d expression. However, although oleuropein (OL) is the main compound in OLE, its role in the antitumour effect of OLE remains unknown. This study determined the effect of OL on GBM cell line T98G and compared the results with our previous findings regarding the effect of OLE on the same cell line. The antiproliferative activity of OL and its effect on temozolomide (TMZ) response were tested inT98G cells using WST-1 assay. OL inhibition was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test. The effect of OL on miR-181b, miR-137, miR-153 and Let-7d expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Fold differences in expression between untreated, OL or OL + TMZ-treated samples were calculated using 2-ΔCt method. Significance was evaluated using an independent sample t-test. Treatment with 277.5 and 555 µM OL resulted in 39.51% and 75.40% reductions in T98G cells within 24 h. Coadministration of 325 µM TMZ and 277.5 or 555 µM, OL caused 2.08- and 2.83-fold increases, respectively, in the therapeutic effect of TMZ. OL + TMZ significantly increased microRNA expression, particularly Let-7d, than OLE. In conclusion, OL has an antitumour effect on GBM cells mainly via regulation of Let-7d expression. The present results also indicate other minor compounds in OLE play important anticancer roles."
2018,29609579,Euterpe oleracea extract inhibits tumorigenesis effect of the chemical carcinogen DMBA in breast experimental cancer.,"Among the processes involved in the breast tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis and inflammation play a central role, and the main factors of these processes are the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and macrophages. Recently, the extract of Euterpe oleracea (açaí), a fruit that is widely found in the Amazon region, already showed antitumorigenic effects in vitro in human breast cancer cell lines. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of açaí on breast cancer using a chemically DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene) experimental model.One day after initiation of treatment with açaí, mammary carcinogenesis was induced in female Wistar rats using a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of DMBA in the mammary gland. Forty rats were randomized into two groups: treated with 200 mg/kg of either açaí extract or vehicle, via gastric tube for 16 consecutive weeks. After treatment, the tumor was collected for macroscopic, histological and immunohistochemical (VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 -VEGFR-2, COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase -MMP-9) analyses; peritoneal fluid was subjected to flow cytometry (F4-80/MAC-2+) and ELISA immunoassay (VEGF, prostaglandin E2 -PGE2 and interleukin-10 -IL-10). Heart, liver and kidney samples were collected for histological analysis.After 16 weeks of induction, the mammary carcinoma was confirmed by macroscopic and histological evaluation. Survival analysis indicates that açaí increased the survival (P = .0002, long-rank test) and reduced the deaths number (P = .0036, Chi-square test). Açaí treatment decreased the number of inflammatory cells and macrophage positive cells (Mac-2 + F4-80+), as well as promoting a reduction in immunostaining of VEGF, VEGFR-2 and COX-2. The açaí group also exhibited lower concentrations of PGE2, VEGF and IL-10 compared to the control. The histopathological results of the liver and kidneys showed protective effect of açaí, since in the control group, there was an increase in fibrosis, atypical cells and hemorrhagic microenvironment.The results of this study demonstrated the antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory potential of açaí, like due to the decreases of the number of activated macrophages, resulting in the inhibition of DMBA carcinogenicity in breast cancer."
2014,25208594,Oral Chinese herbal medicine combined with pharmacotherapy for psoriasis vulgaris: a systematic review.,"Clinically, oral Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis. This review evaluates the effects of oral CHM in combination with pharmacotherapy for psoriasis vulgaris. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI, and CQVIP were searched from their inceptions to November 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating CHM plus pharmacotherapy compared to pharmacotherapy were included. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.1.0. Seventeen RCTs were included, conducted in China, and employed a diversity of both herbal medicines and pharmacotherapies. When the meta-analyses were restricted to studies that used a well-known pharmacotherapy as the comparator with 60% or greater clinical improvement in psoriasis as the outcome, five studies used oral acitretin, one used topical calcipotriol, and one used topical clobetasol propionate as control interventions. At the end of treatment, there was a benefit for the pooled result of the five studies that compared CHM plus acitretin with acitretin alone and no serious adverse events were reported. However, none of these studies was blind, so there is considerable risk of bias in this result. In addition, there was inadequate reporting of longer-term results, so it remains unclear whether the reported effect could be maintained or whether the prolonged use of the CHM in conjunction with acitretin would be safe. The main plants used in these studies, Rehmannia glutinosa root, Salvia miltiorrhiza root, and Lithospermum erythrorhizon root, have shown anti-inflammatory and/or antiproliferative effects in experimental studies. These actions may at least partially explain the observed results. "
2019,31174802,Effect of sodium nitroprusside on antioxidative enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway in blueberry fruit.,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment after harvest on the activity of antioxidative enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway of blueberries. Blueberry fruits were dipped in 1.0 mmol/L SNP solution for 10 min and stored at 4 °C. Fruits treated with distilled water were used as the control. The results indicated that SNP significantly inhibited the increase of weight loss and enhanced the ascorbic acid content of blueberry fruit. Moreover, SNP increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide in blueberry fruit. The accumulation of lignin and anthocyanin in the fruit was also stimulated by the SNP treatment. These results demonstrate that SNP treatment could maintain the antioxidant ability of blueberries by regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway and antioxidant enzymes."
2005,16236146,Protective effects of different antioxidants and amrinone on vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.,"We have studied the effects of three antioxidants and amrinone, an inotropic agent, against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats by investigating renal function and morphology. Thirty adult female Sprague Dawley rats (168-234 g) were divided into six groups. A saline-treated group served as control. The other five groups were treated for 7 days with vancomycin alone or in combination with alpha-lipoic acid, Ginkgo biloba extract 761, melatonin or amrinone. On day 8, all the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, kidney tissues were excised immediately and blood and kidney samples were collected. Blood urea and creatinine, kidney tissue malondialdehyde levels, and kidney superoxide dismutase and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activities were measured. The kidneys were also examined for histological changes. Vancomycin administration led to increased urea, creatinine and malondialdehyde levels and decreased superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase activities. Co-administration of alpha-lipoic acid, Ginkgo biloba extract, melatonin or amrinone with vancomycin prevented the increases in the urea, creatinine and melondialdehyde levels and also resulted in higher superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase activities. The antioxidants and AMR improved the renal pathology compared to rats treated with vancomycin alone (P<0.05). These results indicate that the three antioxidants and amrinone have potential protective effects against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity, which might in part be due to inhibition of free oxygen radical production. Amrinone was the most effective drug as judged on the basis of the pathological findings."
2008,18555207,The effects of environmental neurotoxicants on the dopaminergic system: A possible role in drug addiction.,"Humans are routinely exposed to a vast array of environmental neurotoxicants, including pesticides, endocrine disrupters, and heavy metals. The long-term consequences of exposure have become a major human health concern as research has indicated strong associations between neurotoxicants and a variety of dopamine-related neurological disorders. Developmental exposure to pesticides including paraquat, organochlorines, and rotenone produce alterations in the dopaminergic system and has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Endocrine disrupters such as Bisphenol A, mimic estrogenic activity and impact various dopaminergic processes to enhance mesolimbic dopamine activity resulting in hyperactivity, attention deficits, and a heightened sensitivity to drugs of abuse. A second class of endocrine disrupters, the polychlorinated biphenyls, may act directly on dopaminergic processes to disrupt the dopamine system and produce Parkinson-like symptoms. Exposure to the heavy metal lead enhances dopaminergic activity and has been associated with attention deficits, Alzheimer's disease, and increased drug sensitivity. Manganese exposure, in contrast, results in dopamine deficiencies and Parkinson-like symptoms. Therefore, this commentary will discuss the effects and consequences that exposure to these three classes of environmental neurotoxicants have on the dopamine system and related behaviors and disorders. Finally, the recent hypothesis that exposure to environmental compounds which have effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Bisphenol A, and multiple heavy metals, may potentiate drug-induced behaviors and increase the brain's vulnerability to drug addiction will be discussed."
2018,29941006,Water/ethanol extract of Cucumis sativus L. fruit attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in endothelial cells.,"It is widely accepted the key role of endothelium in the onset of many chronic and acute vascular and cardiovascular diseases. In the last decade, traditional compounds utilized in ""folk medicine"" were considered with increasing interest to discover new bioactive molecules potentially effective in a wide range of diseases including cardiovascular ones. Since ancient times different parts of the Cucumis sativus L. plant were utilized in Ayurvedic medicine, among these, fruits were traditionally used to alleviate skin problem such as sunburn irritation and inflammation. The main purpose of the present research was, in a well-defined in vitro model of endothelial cells, to investigate whether a water/ethanol extract of Cucumis sativus L. (CSE) fruit can attenuate the damaging effect of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Cell viability, gene expression of endothelial cell markers, cytokines secretion and in vitro angiogenesis assay were performed on porcine Aortic Endothelial Cells exposed to increasing doses (0.02; 02; 2 mg/ml) of CSE in the presence of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS 10 μg/ml).CSE reduced LPS-induced cytotoxicity and decreased the cellular detachment, restoring the expression of tight junction ZO-1. The increase of TLR4 expression induced by LPS was counterbalanced by the presence of CSE, while the protective gene Hemeoxygenase (HO)-1 was increased. Cucumis sativus L. inhibited the early robust secretion of inflammatory IL-8 and GM-CSFs, furthermore inhibition of inflammatory IL-6 and IL-1α occurred late at 7 and 24 h respectively. On the contrary, the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10, together with IL-18 and IFN-γ was increased. Moreover, the in vitro angiogenesis induced by inflammatory LPS was prevented by the presence of Cucunis sativus L. extract, at any doses tested.Our results have clearly demonstrated that Cucumis sativus L. extract has attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in endothelial cells."
2014,25451576,Demethylation of neferine in human liver microsomes and formation of quinone methide metabolites mediated by CYP3A4 accentuates its cytotoxicity.,"Neferine is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the seed embryos of Nelumbonucifera Gaertn (Lotus) with various potent pharmacological effects. Recently, neferine has attracted attention for its anti-tumor activities. Our study explored its metabolism and cytotoxicity mechanism. Approaches using chemical inhibitors and recombinant human enzymes to characterize the involved enzymes and kinetic studies indicated that the demethylation of neferine by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4 fitted a biphasic kinetic profile. Glutathione (GSH) was used as a trapping agent to identify reactive metabolites of neferine, and four novel GSH conjugates were detected with [M+H](+) ions at m/z 902.4, 916.2, 916.1, and 930.4. Based on its structure containing para-methylene phenol and results from a product ion scan, GSH tends to conjugate with C9' after undergoing oxidative metabolism to form the binding site predominated by CYP3A4. Furthermore, the addition of recombinant human GSTA1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 had little effect on the production of the GSH conjugates. In a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, combined with the GSH modulators l-buthionine sulfoximine or N-acetyl-l-cysteine, neferine treatment of MDCK-hCYP3A4 and HepG2 cells revealed that CYP3A4 expression and cellular GSH content could cause an EC50 shift.

The percentage of rats with palpable mammary tumors and serum estradiol were lower in the BWPE-fed animals than the casein-fed ones, implying that BWPE intake retarded the mammary carcinogenesis by lowering serum estradiol."
2013,23046999,"Blueberry intervention improves vascular reactivity and lowers blood pressure in high-fat-, high-cholesterol-fed rats.","Growing evidence suggests that intake of flavonoid-containing foods may exert cardiovascular benefits in human subjects. We have investigated the effects of a 10-week blueberry (BB) supplementation on blood pressure (BP) and vascular reactivity in rats fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet, known to induce endothelial dysfunction. Rats were randomly assigned to follow a control chow diet, a chow diet supplemented with 2 % (w/w) BB, a high-fat diet (10 % lard; 0·5 % cholesterol) or the high fat plus BB for 10 weeks. Rats supplemented with BB showed significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) of 11 and 14 %, at weeks 8 and 10, respectively, relative to rats fed the control chow diet (week 8 SBP: 107·5 (SEM 4·7) v. 122·2 (SEM 2·1) mmHg, P= 0·018; week 10 SBP: 115·0 (SEM 3·1) v. 132·7 (SEM 1·5) mmHg, P< 0·0001). Furthermore, SBP was reduced by 14 % in rats fed with the high fat plus 2 % BB diet at week 10, compared to those on the high-fat diet only (SBP: 118·2 (SEM 3·6) v. 139·5 (SEM 4·5) mmHg, P< 0·0001). Aortas harvested from BB-fed animals exhibited significantly reduced contractile responses (to L-phenylephrine) compared to those fed the control chow or high-fat diets. Furthermore, in rats fed with high fat supplemented with BB, aorta relaxation was significantly greater in response to acetylcholine compared to animals fed with the fat diet. These data suggest that BB consumption can lower BP and improve endothelial dysfunction induced by a high fat, high cholesterol containing diet."
1990,2265107,"LF61: a new monoclonal antibody directed against a trimeric molecule (150 kDa, 125 kDa, 105 kDa) associated with hairy cell leukaemia.","The newly produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) LF61 detects a molecule restricted to hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) among B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In particular, the percentage of LF61 + HCL cells in different cases ranges from 10% to 100%. In normal lympho-haemopoietic tissues LF61 reacts with only about 2% of T-cells, mostly of the CD8 subset in the peripheral blood, extrafollicular areas of the tonsil, red pulp of the spleen and thymic medulla. Expression of the LF61 molecule is observed following stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM), suggesting that it represents an activation antigen. Due to its restricted reactivity with a small subset of normal CD8 + T-cells, LF61 in combination with a CD22 mAb is highly suitable for monitoring residual disease in interferon or deoxycoformicin-treated HCL patients. Polyacrylamide gel gradient electrophoresis shows that LF61 precipitates a 150 kDa, 125 kDa, 105 kDa trimeric molecule from the surface of HCL cells. Immunohistological and immunobiochemical results show that this molecule is the same as the one recognized by the still unclustered anti-HCL mAb B-ly7."
1998,9720210,Inhibitory effects of apple polyphenol on induced histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells and rat mast cells.,"The anti-allergic activities of polyphenol fractions extracted from immature fruits of apple (Rosaceae, Malus sp.) were evaluated by in vitro assays. A crude apple polyphenol (CAP) fraction, which had been obtained from the juice of immature apples by reverse-phase column chromatography, was further purified by LH-20 column chromatography to obtain an apple condensed tannin (ACT) fraction consisting of linear oligomeric epicatechins from the dimer to pentadecamer. ACT strongly inhibited the release of histamine from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stimulated by the antigen-stimulation and from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated by compound 48/80. The IC50 values for histamine release were 30 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ACT also inhibited hyaluronidase activity and the increase in intracellular free calcium concentration in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with the antigen. These results suggest that ACT affected early signal transduction including the calcium influx."
1998,9614701,Prevention of peroxidative stress in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet by supplementing with a fermented bovine milk whey preparation: effect of lactic acid and beta-lactoglobulin on the antiperoxidative action.,"We examined the antiperoxidative properties of a fermented bovine milk whey preparation in rats fed on a low vitamin E-containing diet and identified the active principle in the preparation. An exogenous supply of either lactic acid or an amino acid mixture simulated the unfermented whey proteins to prevent red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis and to lower liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The supply of either whey proteins or beta-lactoglobulin resulted in an increase in liver GSH and prevented iron-mediated lipoprotein peroxidation. These protein effects were reproduced in rats orally administered with either GSH or its precursor, gamma-glutamylcysteine. The amount of TBARS formed during in vitro lipoprotein peroxidation were positively correlated with liver TBARS. These results suggest that fermented milk products containing lactic acid and bovine milk whey proteins can ameliorate peroxidative stress in tissues subjected to vitamin E deficiency."
,11299741,Antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects of the tannins of Terminalia catappa L.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) react with biological molecules and destroy the structure of cells and eventually cause free radical-induced disease such as inflammation and cancer. Previous studies showed that an aqueus extract of Terminalia catappa L. exhibited superoxide radical scavenger activity and modification of mitomycin C-induced clasto-genicity. In order to investigate the multiple antioxidant effect of the tannin components of T. catappa L., their ability to prevent lipid peroxidation, superoxide formation and their free radical scavenging activity were evaluated. The results indicated that all of these components showed potent antioxidant activity. Punicalagin and punicalin were the most abundant components and had the strongest anti-oxidative effects of this group of tannins."
2018,30683830,"Characterization and biological effects of Hypericum extracts on experimentally-induced - anxiety, oxidative stress and inflammation in rats.","Anxiety disorders can associate with oxidative stress and immune system alterations. Our study aimed to chemically analyze Hypericum maculatum (HM) and Hypericum perforatum (HP) dry extracts and to evaluate their effects along with quercetin (Q), on brain oxidative stress biomarkers: malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), inflammatory cytokines: interleukin-1α, (IL-1α), IL-1β, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interferon (IFN), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) and serum corticosterone levels. Nuclear transcription factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway in the hippocampus and frontal lobe in rats with N-methyl-9H-pyrido[5,4-b]indole-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) experimental-induced anxiety were also investigated. The chemical analyses of total hypericins were performed by spectrophotometric analysis and hypericin, hyperforin and polyphenols derivatives were quantified by chromatographic methods. The animals were divided in 6 groups: carboxymethylcellulose 2% (CMC); CMC + FG; alprazolam (APZ) + FG; Q + FG; HM + FG; HP + FG. APZ (0.08 mg/kg b.w.), Q (30 mg/kg b.w.), HM and HP (350 mg/kg b.w.) were orally administered for 21 days. FG (7.5 mg/kg b.w.) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected in a single dose. Q and hypericum extracts (HpE) exerted anti-inflammatory (decreased IL-1α, IL-1β, MCP1, IFN and MIP mainly in hippocampus) and antioxidant effects (decreased MDA levels, increased CAT and SOD activity), enhanced NFκB and pNFκB expressions in the brain and reduced serum corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that HpE may improve anxiety-like behavior, offer brain protection by modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and can contribute to overall biological activity of natural compounds-rich diet."
2011,25212342,Effect of legume seed extracts on the inhibition of proteolytic activity and muscle degradation of fresh water prawn (Macrobrachiumrosenbergii).,"Trypsin inhibitors in the extracts from soybean (Glycine max), adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) and red kidney bean (Phaseoulus vulgaris) varied in amount and molecular weight. The soybean extract had the highest level of trypsin inhibitor with molecular weight (MW) of 21kDa, followed by bambara groundnut extract possessing trypsin inhibitor with MW of 15kDa. Both extracts showed a more effective inhibition towards crude protease extract (CE) from the hepatopancreas of fresh water prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) than the extracts from adzuki and red kidney beans. Activity staining also reconfirmed the higher inhibitory activity on CE from hepatopancreas by the extracts from both soybean and bambara groundnut. The extracts from all seeds were able to inhibit the degradation of fresh water prawn meat containing CE in a concentration dependent manner. Based on inhibitor study, the extracts from soybean and bambara groundnut can be a potential aid to suppress the muscle softening of fresh water prawn, mediated by trypsin-like proteases released from hepatopancreas, during extended iced storage.

2001,11515544,Characteristics of wine produced by mushroom fermentation.,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the main microorganism used in wine brewing, because this microbe has potent ability to produce alcohol dehydrogenase. We have recently discovered that some genera of mushroom produced alcohol dehydrogenase, and made wine by using a mushroom in place of S. cerevisiae. The highest alcohol concentration in this wine was achieved with Pleurotus ostreatus (2.6 M, 12.2%). In the case of Agaricus blazei, the same alcohol concentration (1.7 M, 8%) was produced under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This wine produced by A. blazei contained about 0.68% beta-D-glucan, which is known to have a preventive effects against cancer. The wine made by using Flammulina velutipes showed thrombosis-preventing activity, giving a prolonged thrombin clotting time 2.2-fold that of the control. Thus, the wine made by using mushroom seems to be a functional food which can be expected to have preventive effects against cancer and thrombosis."
1996,8616024,Measurement of health-related quality of life in multiple myeloma. Nordic Myeloma Study Group.,"When a randomized trial (NMSG 4/90) comparing treatment with melphalan/prednisone to melphalan/ prednisone + interferon alpha-2b in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma was initiated in 1990, a quality-of-life assessment was integrated into the study. We used the questionnaire (QLQ-C30) developed by the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study Group on Quality of Life. The QLQ-C30 incorporates five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health and quality-of life scale and some single symptom measures. The questionnaire was completed prior to treatment and after 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. 524 (90.2%) of 581 patients enrolled in the NMSG 4/90 completed the first questionnaire, and 484 (83.3%) completed all questionnaires given to them. All but one of the scales met the minimum criteria of reliability (Cronbach's alpha >/ 0.70). Validity was shown by (1) the ability of the scales to discriminate clearly between patients differing in clinical status as defined by pretreatment W.H.O. performance index and Durie & Salmon stage, and (2) the sensitivity to changes in objective disease status (response and relapse). This is the first report of the measurement of health-related quality of life in a prospective clinical trial in multiple myeloma. The results demonstrate that the QLQ-C30 is a reliable and valid instrument for the measurement of quality of life in these patients. The data will be used for a cost-utility analysis of the results of the NMSG 4/90 trial."
2010,20441685,"Consistency of vitamin and/or mineral supplement use and demographic, lifestyle and health-status predictors: findings from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Heidelberg cohort.","Cross-sectional studies suggest that dietary supplement use is associated with favourable demographic and lifestyle factors and certain health conditions. However, factors that affect the consistency of supplement use have not been investigated in prospective cohort studies. The aim of the present study was to seek baseline demographic, lifestyle and health-status predictors of subsequent consistent vitamin and/or mineral supplement use. A total of 8968 men and 10,672 women of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Heidelberg cohort, who answered the supplement-use questions in the baseline survey and two follow-up surveys, were categorised into three groups: consistent, inconsistent and never users. At baseline, 28.5 % of men and 38.6 % of women reported vitamin and/or mineral supplement use. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 14.6 % of men and 22.9 % of women were consistent users. During follow-up, 36.0 % of male and 26.6 % of female initial users stopped supplement use, whereas 27.8 % of male and 39.4 % of female initial non-users started supplement use. Women were more likely to be consistent users than men. Older age (≥ 50 years), lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2) and self-reported hyperlipidaemia were common predictors of consistent use for both sexes. Additional predictors included higher educational level for men, and being more physically active and higher lifetime alcohol consumption for women. Consistent users had the highest intake of dairy products, fish, fruits and vegetables, and wine but the lowest intake of total meat. We concluded that supplement use is a fairly unstable behaviour in free-living individuals. Individuals with a favourable lifestyle and healthier diet are more likely to show consistent supplementation."
1998,9881638,Mechanisms by which Hange-shashin-to reduces prostaglandin E2 levels.,"To determine the mechanisms by which Hange-shashin-to (TJ-14) reduces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, the effects on blood corticosterone levels were examined in vivo and the effects on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in vitro assessed. TJ-14, orally administered to rats at dose levels between 125 and 1000 mg/kg, caused a dose-dependent increase in blood corticosterone levels. We also showed that Glycyrrhizae Radix and Ginseng Radix, constituents of TJ-14, are involved in the increase in blood corticosterone. The activity of COX-1 was not inhibited by TJ-14 even at a dose of 1000 microg/ml, while COX-2 was inhibited at dose levels between 10 and 1000 microg/ml. The constituents Scutellariae Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix and Coptidis Rhizoma were believed to be involved in COX-2 inhibition. These results suggest that the effect of TJ-14 in decreasing PGE2 is partially mediated by corticosterone and inhibition of COX-2."
2002,12243869,Inhibitory effect of chamomile essential oil on the sister chromatid exchanges induced by daunorubicin and methyl methanesulfonate in mouse bone marrow.,"Different preparations of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) are used to treat various diseases, including inflammation and cancer; however, no studies on the plant's antigenotoxic capacity have been made. The aim of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the chamomile essential oil (CO), on the sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) produced by daunorubicin and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in mouse bone marrow cells. CO was analyzed and was found to contain 13 compounds, mainly bisabolol and its oxides, chamazulene, farnesene, germacrene and other sesquiterpenes. Initially, a toxic and a genotoxic analysis of CO were made; both showed negative results. To determine whether CO can inhibit the mutagenic effects induced by daunorubicin, one group of mice was administered corn oil, another group was treated with the mutagen (10 mg/kg), a third group was treated with 500 mg/kg of CO; three other groups were treated first with CO (5, 50 and 500 mg/kg) and then with 10 mg/kg of daunorubicin. In the case of MMS, the experimental groups consisted of the following: the negative control group which was administered corn oil, a group treated with 25 mg/kg of MMS, a group treated with 1000 mg/kg of CO, and three groups treated first with CO (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) and then with MMS (25 mg/kg). The results indicated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the SCEs formed by both mutagens. In the case of daunorubicin, a statistically significant result was observed in the three tested doses: from the lowest to the highest dose, the inhibitory values corresponded to 25.7, 63.1 and 75.5%. No alterations were found with respect to the cellular proliferation kinetics, but a reduction in the mitotic index was detected. As regards MMS, the inhibitory values were 24.8, 45.8 and 60.6%; no alterations were found in either the cellular proliferation kinetics or in the mitotic indices. Our results suggest that CO may be an effective antimutagen that could be considered for further study."
2019,30481497,Cannabidiol reduces airway inflammation and fibrosis in experimental allergic asthma.,"Asthma is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Asthma remains a major public health problem and, at present, there are no effective interventions capable of reversing airway remodelling. Cannabidiol (CBD) is known to exert immunomodulatory effects through the activation of cannabinoid-1 and - 2 (CB1 and CB2) receptors located in the central nervous system and immune cells, respectively. However, as the role of CBD on airway remodelling and the mechanisms of CB1 and CB2 aren't fully elucidated, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of cannabidiol in this scenario. Allergic asthma was induced in Balb/c mice exposed to ovalbumin, and respiratory mechanics, collagen fibre content in airway and alveolar septa, cytokine levels, and CB1 and CB2 expression were determined. Moreover, expressions of CB1 and CB2 in induced sputum of asthmatic individuals and their correlation with airway inflammation and lung function were also evaluated. CBD treatment, regardless of dosage, decreased airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas static lung elastance only reduced with high dose. These outcomes were accompanied by decreases in collagen fibre content in both airway and alveolar septa and the expression of markers associated with inflammation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung homogenate. There was a significant and inverse correlation between CB1 levels and lung function in asthmatic patients. CBD treatment decreased the inflammatory and remodelling processes in the model of allergic asthma. The mechanisms of action appear to be mediated by CB1/CB2 signalling, but these receptors may act differently on lung inflammation and remodelling."
2005,15930895,"Resveratrol may reduce oxidative stress induced by platinum compounds in human plasma, blood platelets and lymphocytes.","Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-tumor and anti-platelet activities. Using different methods, we show that resveratrol reduces oxidative stress induced by cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) and selenium-cisplatin conjugate ([NH(3)](2)Pt(SeO(3)), Se-Pt) in human blood platelets, lymphocytes and plasma. Resveratrol decreased the production of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2) (a biomarker of lipid peroxidation) in control blood platelets and platelets treated with platinum compounds (10 microg/ml), and markedly reduced activities of different anti-oxidative enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in these cells. A combined action of resveratrol and Se-Pt evoked a significant decrease of DNA damage (measured by comet assay) in lymphocytes compared with cells treated with Se-Pt only. Resveratrol also caused a distinct reduction of total anti-oxidant level in plasma after incubation with platinum compounds. Therefore, anti-oxidative activity of resveratrol may diminish oxidative stress and damage to cellular biomolecules (lipids, proteins and DNA) induced by platinum compounds."
2009,19267949,"Dehydroepiandrosterone activates cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate/protein kinase A signalling and suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 expression in cultured primary chicken hepatocytes.","Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone that is secreted by the adrenal cortex in mammals, has an array of biological actions, including inhibition of fat synthesis, decreasing the number of adipocytes, and a reduction in mammalian metabolic efficiency. Recent studies showed that DHEA may decrease fat deposition in poultry, but the mechanism of action is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that DHEA stimulates intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in chicken hepatocytes during a 30 min incubation period. Increases in intracellular cAMP are evoked by as low as 0.1 microm-DHEA. The cAMP induced by DHEA, while suppressing cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity, also activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in chicken hepatocytes. In addition, the activation of PKA leads to down-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). These findings demonstrate that direct action by DHEA leads to activation of the cAMP/PKA signalling system in the modulation of lipid metabolism by repressing SREBP-1, thereby providing a novel explanation for some of the underlying effects proposed for DHEA in the prevention of fat deposition in poultry."
2013,24022868,"Dehydroepiandrosterone exerts antiglucocorticoid action on human preadipocyte proliferation, differentiation, and glucose uptake.","Glucocorticoids increase adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, a process underpinned by the local reactivation of inactive cortisone to active cortisol within adipocytes catalyzed by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1). The adrenal sex steroid precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been shown to inhibit 11β-HSD1 in murine adipocytes; however, rodent adrenals do not produce DHEA physiologically. Here, we aimed to determine the effects and underlying mechanisms of the potential antiglucocorticoid action of DHEA and its sulfate ester DHEAS in human preadipocytes. Utilizing a human subcutaneous preadipocyte cell line, Chub-S7, we examined the metabolism and effects of DHEA in human adipocytes, including adipocyte proliferation, differentiation, 11β-HSD1 expression, and activity and glucose uptake. DHEA, but not DHEAS, significantly inhibited preadipocyte proliferation via cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase independent of sex steroid and glucocorticoid receptor activation. 11β-HSD1 oxoreductase activity in differentiated adipocytes was inhibited by DHEA. DHEA coincubated with cortisone significantly inhibited preadipocyte differentiation, which was assessed by the expression of markers of early (LPL) and terminal (G3PDH) adipocyte differentiation. Coincubation with cortisol, negating the requirement for 11β-HSD1 oxoreductase activity, diminished the inhibitory effect of DHEA. Further consistent with glucocorticoid-opposing effects of DHEA, insulin-independent glucose uptake was significantly enhanced by DHEA treatment. DHEA increases basal glucose uptake and inhibits human preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby exerting an antiglucocorticoid action. DHEA inhibition of the amplification of glucocorticoid action mediated by 11β-HSD1 contributes to the inhibitory effect of DHEA on human preadipocyte differentiation."
2016,27476938,Protective Effect of Ginsenoside Rg1 on Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Rats: Involvement of Caveolin-1 and TGF-β1 Signal Pathway.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Panax Notoginseng Saponins (PNS), extracted from Panax Notoginseng as a traditional Asian medicine, displayed a significant anti-fibrosis effect in liver and lung. However, whether Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), an important and active ingredient of PNS, exerts anti-fibrotic activity on IPF still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of Rg1 on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. Bleomycin (5 mg/kg body weight) was intratracheally administrated to male rats. Rg1 (18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) was orally administered on the next day after bleomycin. Lungs were harvested at day 7 and 28 for the further experiments. Histological analysis revealed that bleomycin successfully induced pulmonary fibrosis, and that Rg1 restored the histological alteration of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF), significantly decreased lung coefficient, scores of alveolitis, scores of PF as well as contents of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in a dose-dependent manner in PF rats. Moreover, Rg1 increased the expression levels of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mRNA and protein, lowered the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) mRNA and protein in the lung tissues of PF rats. These data suggest that Rg1 exhibits protective effect against bleomycin-induced PF in rats, which is potentially associated with the down-regulation of TGF-β1 and up-regulation of Cav-1. "
1999,10375167,Effect of Perilla frutescens extract on nitric oxide production by cultured murine mesangial cells.,"The effects of a water extract of perilla (Perilla frutescens Britton) leaves on nitric oxide (NO) production by cultured murine mesangial cells were investigated. Perilla extract significantly induced NO production from mesangial cells, which was enormously augmented without cytotoxity by combination with interferon (IFN)-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. On the other hand, perilla extract suppressed a large amount of NO production induced by IFN-gamma combined with lipopolysaccharide. Northern blot analysis revealed that such effects of perilla extract were dependent on inducible NO synthase mRNA expression. Perilla extract exhibited an inhibitory effect on cytokine-induced mesangial cell proliferation, and this effect was significantly decreased upon combination with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a non-specific NO synthase inhibitor, suggesting that perilla extract inhibits mesangial cell proliferation partially through the induction of NO production. Such results indicate that perilla may be a promising agent for the prevention of the progression of glomerulonephritis."
1990,2103760,Effect of mefenamic acid on bowel transit time in healthy adult volunteers.,"The effect of mefenamic acid on bowel transit time was investigated. Seven healthy adult male subjects of age 39 +/- 2.4 years (mean +/- S.E.M.) received placebo or mefenamic acid (500 mg t.d.s) orally in randomized order for five days, with a 7-day washout between studies. On the third morning after starting the drug they had a meal containing Redi-Brek and baked beans with radio-opaque markers. Small bowel transit time was measured using breath hydrogen, and whole gut transit time was measured using radio-opaque markers. The small bowel transit times were 160 min (median) with placebo and 50 min with mefenamic acid (P less than 0.05). The percentages of appearance of marker in stool within 24 h were 24.9 +/- 11.8 (mean +/- S.E.M.) with placebo and 48.9 +/- 11.7 with mefenamic acid (P less than 0.05). The times of appearance of twenty-fifth marker in stool were 41.0 +/- 4.4 h with placebo and 26.9 +/- 3.2 h with mefenamic acid (P less than 0.05). The total weights of faeces in 72 h were 500.9 +/- 96.2 g with placebo and 657.1 +/- 118.8 g with mefenamic acid (P less than 0.05). Mefenamic acid in therapeutic doses (500 mg t.d.s.) accelerated bowel transit time in healthy subjects."

2001,11377396,"Role of cellular zinc in programmed cell death: temporal relationship between zinc depletion, activation of caspases, and cleavage of Sp family transcription factors.","Zinc is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, whereas zinc depletion induces apoptosis in many cell lines. To investigate the mechanisms of zinc depletion-induced apoptosis, HeLa cells were treated with the membrane permeable metal ion chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). TPEN decreased the intracellular level of zinc and induced apoptosis with a characteristic cellular pattern, i.e. cell shrinkage and formation of apoptotic bodies, with DNA fragmentation and formation of a typical DNA ladder pattern. Following TPEN treatment, caspases-3, -8, and -9 were activated and caspase target proteins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and Sp transcription factors were cleaved. These effects were inhibited by adding zinc to the medium. To assess the role of zinc in the activation of the caspase cascade, we compared zinc inhibition during tumor necrosis factor alpha/cycloheximide- and etoposide-induced apoptosis with that induced by TPEN. Zinc addition partially inhibited caspase-3 activation, but not caspase-8 and -9 cleavage in HeLa cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha or etoposide. These results suggest that caspase-3 is rapidly and directly activated by zinc chelation, without a requirement for an upstream event. Caspase-3 activation is therefore the main event leading to apoptosis after intracellular zinc chelation. Finally, we conclude that cellular zinc inhibits apoptosis by maintaining caspase-3 inactive."

In the present study, we investigated whether GRb1 has an anti-inflammatory effect on postoperative ileus (POI) and further contributes to the recovery of gastrointestinal motility. POI was induced in rats by intestinal manipulation. The POI rats received 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg GRb1 orally via gavage four times before and after surgery. Gastrointestinal motility was assessed by charcoal transport. Systemic inflammation was assessed by serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations, whereas intestinal inflammation was assessed by the activity of myeloperoxidase, and concentrations and gene expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the ileum tissue. The results revealed that GRb1 increased rat gastrointestinal transit with POI. The increased levels of systemic and intestinal inflammatory parameters in POI rats were also reduced by GRb1. In addition, GRb1 reduced systemic and intestinal inflammation and increased the gastrointestinal transit of POI rats in a dose-dependent manner, and with signiﬁcance at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. These results suggest that GRb1 has a potent anti-inflammatory effect on POI and further contributes to the recovery of gastrointestinal motility. GRb1 may be a promising treatment for POI prophylaxis."
2012,23043497,Physicochemical and antioxidant properties of Bangladeshi honeys stored for more than one year.,"There is no available information on physicochemical and antioxidant properties on Bangladeshi honey. We investigated five different monofloral and three different multifloral honey samples collected from different parts of Bangladesh.The levels of phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant content (AEAC), proline, protein and antioxidants were determined in the honey samples using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays.The highest level of phenolic was 688.5 ± 5.9 mg Gallic acid/kg, and the highest level of flavonoid was 155 ± 6.9 mg Catechin/kg. The highest color intensity was 2034.00 ± 17.5 mAU, and the highest protein content was 8.6 ± 0.0mg/g. High levels of proline (2932.8 ± 3.7 mg/kg), ascorbic acid (154.3 ± 0.3 mg/kg), AEAC (34.1 ± 1.4mg/100 g) and FRAP (772.4 ± 2.5 μmol Fe (II)/100 g) were detected in some of the samples, especially the multifloral honey samples, indicating good antioxidant properties. A strong positive correlation was found between phenolics, flavonoids, DPPH, FRAP and color intensity, indicating that in addition to total phenolic and flavonoid concentrations, color intensity and amino acid are good indicators of the antioxidant potential of honey. Except for a single sample (BDH-6), the honey samples stored for 1.5 years at room temperature still had 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) values within the recommended range (mean = 10.93 mg/kg), indicating that the rate of HMF production in Bangladeshi honey samples is low.It is postulated that the low rate of HMF formation could be attributed to the acidic and low moisture content in the samples. In general, multifloral honeys have higher antioxidant properties based on their high levels of phenolics, flavonoids, AEAC, DPPH and FRAP when compared to monofloral honeys. We also found that monofloral honey samples from Guizotia abyssinica and Nigella sativa had high antioxidant properties."
2018,29146359,Determination of tryptophan derivatives in kynurenine pathway in fermented foods using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,"This study aimed to develop an analytical method for the determination of tryptophan and its derivatives in kynurenine pathway using tandem mass spectrometry in various fermented food products (bread, beer, red wine, white cheese, yoghurt, kefir and cocoa powder). The method entails an aqueous extraction and reversed phase chromatographic separation using pentafluorophenyl (PFP) column. It allowed quantitation of low ppb levels of tryptophan and its derivatives in different fermented food matrices. It was found that beer samples were found to contain kynurenine within the range of 28.7±0.7μg/L and 86.3±0.5μg/L. Moreover, dairy products (yoghurt, white cheese and kefir) contained kynurenine ranging from 30.3 to 763.8μg/kg d.w. Though bread samples analyzed did not contain kynurenic acid, beer and red wine samples as yeast-fermented foods were found to contain kynurenic acid. Among foods analyzed, cacao powder had the highest amounts of kynurenic acid (4486.2±165.6μg/kgd.w), which is a neuroprotective compound."
2013,23497865,Lipid components and water soluble metabolites in salted and dried tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) roes.,"The salted and dried product of tuna roe (bottarga) is a seafood characteristic of the Mediterranean area and exported all over the world. Samples of bottarga from bluefin tunas (Thunnus thynnus, L.) caught in the southwest Mediterranean sea were analysed. The samples were characterised by high content of marine wax esters (55-67 mol% of lipid classes), of docosahexaenoic (22:6 n-3, 25 w%) and oleic (18:1 n-9, 19 w%) fatty acids. Cholesterol was detected as 7-9 w% of lipids. Free fatty acids, index of lipid hydrolysis, represented 32-39 mol% over total fatty acids. Among metabolites, nutrients as taurine, nicotinamide and β-alanine, were found. The microflora comprised staphylococci, enterococci (2.2 log(10)CFU/g) and lactic acid bacteria (3 log(10) CFU/g). The food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were not detected. These findings indicate tuna bottarga as valuable source of nutrients."
2012,22338546,Antinociceptive activity and effect of methanol extract of Salvia limbata on withdrawal syndrome in mice.,"Salvia (S.) is an important genus consisting of about 900 species in the Lamiaceae family. They are several reports that some Salvia spp. has effects on the central nervous system (CNS). The present experiments were undertaken to study the protective effect of S. limbata on the development of dependence to morphine in mice.Antinociceptive activity of aerial parts of S. limbata was investigated using the hot plate method. In addition, the effect of its aerial parts on morphine dependence was investigated in mice. After induction of dependence by morphine, different concentrations of plant aerial parts extract were injected to treated groups. To assess morphine withdrawal, mice were injected naloxone (5 mg/kg) i.p. on the 5th day. After four consecutive days of morphine injection, withdrawal syndrome was assessed by placing each mouse in a 30 cm high glass box and recording the frequency of escape jumps for 60 minutes.Animal receiving acute treatment with morphine displayed dependence. The animals treated with different extract concentrations could decrease frequency of escape jumps in number or decrease development of morphine dependence. Addiction was observed following naloxone administration. Methanol extract of S. limbata produced a statistically significant inhibition of pain induced by hot plate latency at 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg i.p. A significant increase in pain threshold was observed after 30 and 60 min (p < 0.001). The activity was comparable to that of morphine (30 mg kg(-1) i.p., p > 0.05). The anti-nociceptive activity of S. limbata increased until the 60th min (p < 0.05 compared to morphine).S. limbata extract produced statistically significant inhibition of pain and development of morphine dependence in mice."
2010,20118551,Selective cholinesterase inhibitory activities of a new monoterpene diglycoside and other constituents from Nelumbo nucifera stamens.,"A new beta-cyclogeraniol diglycoside (5), along with four known components, cycloartenol (1), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (2), vanilloloside (3), and 5'-O-methyladenosine (4), were first isolated from the n-BuOH fraction of Nelumbo nucifera stamens. The chemical structure of 5 was elucidated as 1-hydroxymethyl-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexene 9-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (nuciferoside) on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, including 1D, 2D NMR, and MS. The anti-Alzheimer effects of 1-5 were evaluated via the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibition assays. Compounds 1-3 and 5 showed good and noncompetitive inhibition against AChE with IC(50) values of 11.89, 20.07, 4.55, and 3.20 microM and K(i)values of 15.71, 25.44, 7.76, and 5.76 microM, respectively. Compounds 1, 2, and 5 also possessed BChE inhibitory activities with IC(50) values of 13.93, 62.29, 205.78, and 83.06 microM, respectively. The selectivity index (SI) values of 1, 2, 3, and 5, calculated from IC(50) values of BChE and AChE, were 1.2, 3.1, 45.7, and 26.0. However, all isolated compounds lacked BACE1 inhibition up to 100 microM. Therefore, N. nucifera stamens-derived compounds could potentially exert their primary anti-Alzheimer effects as AChE inhibitors rather than BACE1 inhibitors."
2002,12445866,Hyperforin is a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase.,"The acylphloroglucinol derivative hyperforin is the major lipophilic constituent in the herb Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort). The aim of the present study was to investigate if hyperforin as well as extracts of H. perforatum can suppresses the activities of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenases (COX), key enzymes in the formation of proinflammatory eicosanoids from arachidonic acid (AA). In freshly isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with Ca(2+) ionophore A23187, hyperforin inhibited 5-LO product formation with IC(50) values of about 1-2 microM, in the absence or presence of exogenous AA (20 microM), respectively, being almost equipotent to the well-documented 5-LO inhibitor zileuton (IC(50) = 0.5-1 microM). Experiments with purified human 5-LO demonstrate that hyperforin is a direct 5-LO inhibitor (IC(50) approximately 90 nM), acting in an uncompetitive fashion. In thrombin- or ionophore-stimulated human platelets, hyperforin suppressed COX-1 product (12(S)-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid) formation with an IC(50) of 0.3 and 3 microM, respectively, being about 3- to 18-fold more potent than aspirin. At similar concentrations, hyperforin suppressed COX-1 activity in platelets in presence of exogenous AA (20 microM) as well as in cell-free systems. Hyperforin could not interfere with COX-2 product formation and did not significantly inhibit 12- or 15-LO in platelets or leukocytes, respectively. We conclude that hyperforin acts as a dual inhibitor of 5-LO and COX-1 in intact cells as well as on the catalytic activity of the crude enzymes, suggesting therapeutic potential in inflammatory and allergic diseases connected to eicosanoids."
2017,28606469,Potential chemoprotective role of resveratrol against cisplatin induced testicular damage in mice.,"Semen banking is often advised to male patients undergoing chemotherapy as the damage induced is profound and often irreversible. However, low success rates of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) using banked semen have led to the quest for alternative methods to treat chemotherapy-induced infertility. The present study therefore aimed to study the role of resveratrol against cisplatin induced testicular damage. Male albino mice were divided into five groups (n = 6 each), viz. normal control, resveratrol vehicle (4% ethanol), Cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg b.wt/week for 4 weeks), Resveratrol (1 mg/kg b.wt./orally for 28 days) and Resveratrol and Cisplatin combination group. Cisplatin treatment led to an increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and an increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation. Glutathione levels were found to decrease with a concomitant increase in the levels of oxidized glutathione and altered status of antioxidant enzymes. Increased DNA fragmentation was also evident which was further confirmed by histopathological and FT-IR analysis. Resveratrol treatment in combination with cisplatin showed great promise in bringing down the damage statistics to near normal values in most of the parameters studied. Further studies in this direction are however needed to develop an alternative to current procedures adopted to treat chemotherapy-induced male infertility."
2017,27930989,Protective effect of Nigella sativa oil on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative damage in rat kidney.,"Nephrotoxicity is a severe complication in patients undergoing cisplatin (CP) chemotherapy. Previous studies in our lab have shown that administration of a single dose of CP results in decrease in the activities of brush border membrane (BBM) and free radical scavenging enzymes and induces oxidative stress in rat kidney. Nigella sativa, is one of the most revered medicinal plant known for its numerous health benefits. Nigella sativa seed/oil has been shown to improve kidney functions in animal models of acute kidney injury.The present study was undertaken to investigate whether Nigella sativa oil (NSO) can prevent the CP-induced nephrotoxic effects.The effect of NSO was determined on CP induced alterations in various serum parameters and on enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, BBM and antioxidant defense system in renal cortex and medulla. Administration of NSO (2ml/kg bwt. orally), prior to and following a single dose CP treatment (6mg/kg bwt. i.p), significantly attenuated the CP induced increase in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and decrease in the activities of BBM enzymes in renal cortical and medullary homogenates as well as in isolated BBM vesicles (BBMV). NSO administration also precluded CP induced alterations in the activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes and in the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters. Histopathological observations showed extensive kidney damage in CP treated animals and remarkably reduced renal injury in CP and NSO co-treated group.The biochemical and histological data suggest a protective effect of NSO against CP-induced acute kidney injury."
2017,28440569,Toxicity of silver nanoparticles to Arabidopsis: Inhibition of root gravitropism by interfering with auxin pathway.,"Impacts of polyvinylpyrrolidine-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels. Our results showed that AgNPs were taken up by the root and primarily localized at the cell wall and intercellular spaces. Root gravitropism was inhibited by exposure to AgNPs, and the inhibition in root gravitropism caused by exposure to AgNPs exhibited a dose-response relationship. Auxin accumulation was reduced in the root tips because of exposure to AgNPs. However, increased indole-3-acetic acid level could not rescue the inhibition of root gravitropism. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed significant downregulation of expression of auxin receptor-related genes, which is the TIR1/AFB family of F-box proteins including AFB1, AFB2, AFB3, AFB5, and TIR1. Therefore, the present study suggests that AgNPs have toxicity to the model plant A. thaliana as shown by inhibition of root gravitropism along with a reduction in auxin accumulation and expression of auxin receptors.

2008,18378205,High d(+)glucose concentration inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.,"Diabetes is a chronic disease associated with hyperglycemia and altered bone metabolism that may lead to complications including osteopenia, increased risk of fracture and osteoporosis. Hyperglycemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic bone disease; however, the biologic effect of glucose on osteoclastogenesis is unclear. In the present study, we examined the effect of high d(+)glucose (d-Glc) and l(-)glucose (l-Glc; osmotic control) on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis using RAW264.7 cells and Bone Marrow Macrophages (BMM) as models. Cells were exposed to sustained high glucose levels to mimic diabetic conditions. Osteoclast formation was analyzed using tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) assay, expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR) and cathepsin K mRNAs, and cultures were examined for reactive oxygen species (ROS) using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescence, caspase-3 and Nuclear Factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. Cellular function was assessed using a migration assay. Results show, for the first time, that high d-Glc inhibits osteoclast formation, ROS production, caspase-3 activity and migration in response to RANKL through a metabolic pathway. Our findings also suggest that high d-Glc may alter RANKL-induced osteoclast formation by inhibiting redox-sensitive NF-kappaB activity through an anti-oxidative mechanism. This study increases our understanding of the role of glucose in diabetes-associated bone disease. Our data suggest that high glucose levels may alter bone turnover by decreasing osteoclast differentiation and function in diabetes and provide new insight into the biologic effects of glucose on osteoclastogenesis."
2015,25341882,Berberine ameliorates intestinal mucosal barrier damage induced by peritoneal air exposure.,"Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from many medicinal plants, has been extensively used to treat various gastrointestinal diseases. In the present study, we investigated whether berberine could ameliorate intestinal mucosal barrier damage induced by peritoneal air exposure for 3 h. Peritoneal air-exposure rats received 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg berberine orally via gavage four times before and after surgery. Blood and terminal ileum samples were collected 24 h after surgery. The serum D-lactate levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Intestinal permeability was determined by measuring the intestinal clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (FD4). Intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring myeloperoxidase activity. Intestinal histopathology was also assessed. The results revealed that berberine decreased the serum D-lactate level, intestinal FD4 clearance, and myeloperoxidase activity. Edema and inflammation were reduced by berberine in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa, and the Chiu's scores, indices of intestinal mucosal injury, also decreased in the berberine-treated group. In addition, berberine exerted these protective effects in a dose-dependent manner, with a significant difference from the control group at doses of 150 and 200 mg/kg. The results suggest that berberine could ameliorate intestinal mucosal barrier damage induced by peritoneal air exposure, which is linked to its anti-inflammatory activity. Berberine may be a promising treatment for intestinal mucosal barrier damage in open abdominal surgery."
1988,3389388,Effects of ribavirin on neutrophil function.,"Ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral agent, has been shown to exhibit immunosuppressive activity. This property has raised concerns during clinical trials because candidates for antiviral therapy are those who may develop secondary bacterial infection. We therefore investigated a number of parameters of neutrophil function after the in vitro addition of various concentrations of ribavirin. At pharmacologic concentrations (1.25-7.5 micrograms/mL), percent killing of phagocytized bacteria was increased as measured by an acridine orange fluorochrome microassay, significantly higher at a concentration of 5 micrograms/mL (p less than .02). There was no concomitant adverse effect on adherence, random migration, chemotaxis, opsonization or phagocytosis. The present data indicate that ribavirin has no acute suppressive effect on granulocyte function and may even enhance bacterial killing capabilities for treated patients."
2011,21212526,"The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory action of the CHCl3-soluble phase and its main active component, damnacanthal, isolated from the root of Morinda citrifolia.","Morinda citrifolia (Rubiaceae, Noni) is a traditional medicine with various pharmacological activities. We investigated if the MeOH-, CHCl(3)- and BuOH-soluble phase and its main active component, damnacanthal, isolated from the Noni root, have antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory actions in mice. The CHCl(3)-soluble phase (3 g/kg, per os (p.o.)) significantly reduced pain-related behavior observed in the formalin test. These effects were not suppressed by pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), an opioid receptor antagonist. The CHCl(3)-soluble phase (3 g/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced histamine-induced paw edema. The MeOH- and BuOH-soluble phase had no effect in either test. Furthermore, damnacanthal (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) exerted an antinociceptive effect on chemical nociceptive stimuli, and decreased histamine-induced paw edema. Damnacanthal was weakly bound to the histamine H(1) receptor. These data suggest that the CHCl(3)-soluble phase of the Noni root has antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, these effects of damnacanthal isolated from the Noni root is mediated in part by the histamine H(1) receptor."
1998,9818800,Herbal medicinals: selected clinical considerations focusing on known or potential drug-herb interactions.,"Herbal medicinals are being used by an increasing number of patients who typically do not advise their clinicians of concomitant use. Known or potential drug-herb interactions exist and should be screened for. If used beyond 8 weeks, Echinacea could cause hepatotoxicity and therefore should not be used with other known hepatoxic drugs, such as anabolic steroids, amiodarone, methotrexate, and ketoconazole. However, Echinacea lacks the 1,2 saturated necrine ring associated with hepatoxicity of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may negate the usefulness of feverfew in the treatment of migraine headaches. Feverfew, garlic, Ginkgo, ginger, and ginseng may alter bleeding time and should not be used concomitantly with warfarin sodium. Additionally, ginseng may cause headache, tremulousness, and manic episodes in patients treated with phenelzine sulfate. Ginseng should also not be used with estrogens or corticosteroids because of possible additive effects. Since the mechanism of action of St John wort is uncertain, concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is ill advised. Valerian should not be used concomitantly with barbiturates because excessive sedation may occur. Kyushin, licorice, plantain, uzara root, hawthorn, and ginseng may interfere with either digoxin pharmacodynamically or with digoxin monitoring. Evening primrose oil and borage should not be used with anticonvulsants because they may lower the seizure threshold. Shankapulshpi, an Ayurvedic preparation, may decrease phenytoin levels as well as diminish drug efficacy. Kava when used with alprazolam has resulted in coma. Immunostimulants (eg, Echinacea and zinc) should not be given with immunosuppressants (eg, corticosteroids and cyclosporine). Tannic acids present in some herbs (eg, St John wort and saw palmetto) may inhibit the absorption of iron. Kelp as a source of iodine may interfere with thyroid replacement therapies. Licorice can offset the pharmacological effect of spironolactone. Numerous herbs (eg, karela and ginseng) may affect blood glucose levels and should not be used in patients with diabetes mellitus."
2018,29710525,Balanites aegyptiaca ameliorates insulin secretion and decreases pancreatic apoptosis in diabetic rats: Role of SAPK/JNK pathway.,"SAPK-JNK pathway performs a significant role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Balanites aegyptiaca (BA) is used as an anti-diabetic agent in folk medicine however its hypoglycemic mechanism is not fully elucidated. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of crude extract, butanol, and dichloromethane fractions from BA on the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK-JNK) pathway in experimental diabetic rats. Six groups of male Wistar rats were included: normal control, diabetic, diabetic rats treated with crude, butanol or dichloromethane fraction from BA (50 mg/kg BW) and diabetic rats treated with gliclazide as a reference drug for one month. Our results suggested a protective role of treatment of diabetic rats with BA against oxidative stress-induced SAPK-JNK pathway. Moreover, BA treatment produced a reduction in plasma glucose, HbA1c, lactic acid, lipid profile, malondialdehyde levels and produced an increase in insulin, reduced glutathione levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities compared with untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, it decreased apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, protein 53 and increased insulin receptor substrate 1 in rat pancreas while it increased glucose transporter 4 in rat muscle. Analysis of BA extracts by LC-HRMS revealed the presence of different saponins with reported hypoglycemic effect. In conclusion, BA exerted hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, insulinotropic and antioxidant effects. Additionally, it reduced apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells and increased glucose uptake in muscle. These results suggest that the hypoglycemic effect of BA is due to the inhibition of the SAPK-JNK pathway."
2010,20545578,Diminution of free radical induced DNA damage by extracts/fractions from bark of Schleichera oleosa (Lour.) Oken.,"The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of extracts of Schleichera oleosa (Sapindaceae) for its cytotoxic and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities. The bark of the tree was used to prepare extracts with different solvents (i.e., hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water). The extracts were initially assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity potential in the sulforhodamine B dye assay against cell lines, such as 502713 (colon), SW-620 (colon), HCT-15 (colon), A-549 (lung), HEP-2 (liver), SK-NS-H (central nervous system), and IMR-32 (neuroblastoma). It was observed that the water extract was effective against all the three colon cancer cell lines, while only methanol and water extracts were effective against A-549 (lung) and HEP-2 (liver), respectively. As DNA damage is one of the hallmarks of cell death, so the extracts were assessed for their ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals, in the deoxyribose degradation assay (site- and nonsite specific) as well as their protective effect against the hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage in the plasmid nicking assay, using pBR322. It was observed that all the extracts, except chloroform and hexane, exhibited relatively greater antioxidant activity in the nonsite-specific than in the site-specific assay. Similarly, the extracts were also found to be effective in inhibiting the hydroxyl radical-induced unwinding of supercoiled DNA, which further confirmed the hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of the extracts in the deoxyribose degradation method."
2011,21144097,The impact of the catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype on the acute responsiveness of vascular reactivity to a green tea extract.,"The beneficial effects of green tea catechins, such as the proposed improvement in endothelial function, may be influenced by phase II metabolism during and after absorption. The methylation enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), has a missense mutation rs4680 (G to A), proposed to result in a 40 % reduction in enzyme activity. In the present pilot study, twenty subjects (ten of each homozygous COMT genotype) were recruited. Green tea extract capsules (836 mg green tea catechins) were given in a fasted state, and a high-carbohydrate breakfast was given after 60 min. Blood samples and vascular function measurements were taken at regular intervals. The change in digital volume pulse stiffness index (SI) from baseline was shown to be different between genotype groups at 120 and 240 min, with a lower SI in the GG individuals (P ≤ 0·044). The change in blood pressure from baseline also differed between genotype groups, with a greater increase in systolic (P = 0·023) and diastolic (P = 0·034) blood pressure at 120 min in the GG group. The GG [corrected] group was shown to have a greater increase in insulin concentrations at 120 min (P = 0·019) and 180 min (P = 0·008) compared with baseline, despite similar glucose profiles. No genotypic differences were found in vascular reactivity measured using laser Doppler iontophoresis, total nitrite, lipids, plasma total antioxidant capacity or inflammatory markers after ingestion of the green tea extract. In conclusion, SI and insulin response to the glucose load differed between the COMT genotype groups, and this may be suggestive of a green tea extract and genotype interaction."
2013,23298251,Investigation of antigenotoxic potential of Syzygium cumini extract (SCE) on cyclophosphamide-induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress in mice.,"The present study investigated the protective effects of Syzygium cumini extract (SCE; 100 and 200 mg/kg) against genotoxicity and oxidative stress (OS) induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) in mice. Animals were received 14 days pretreatment (oral) of SCE, followed by induction of genotoxicity by CP (40 mg/kg), 24 hours before sacrifice. Mice bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay, micronucleus assay, and sperm abnormality assay were employed for the study. Activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes were also investigated. Phytochemical investigation was done to determine total phenolic and flavonoid content in SCE. Results showed that CP produced a significant increase in average percentage of aberrant metaphases and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) excluding gap, and micronuclei (MN) formation in polychromatic erythrocytes produced cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow cells and induced abnormal sperms in a male germ line. CP also markedly inhibited the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutahione (GSH) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Pretreatments with SCE significantly inhibited the frequencies of aberrant metaphases, CAs, MN formation, and cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow cells induced by CP. SCE also produced a significant reduction of abnormal sperm and antagonized the reduction of CP-induced SOD, CAT, and GSH activities and inhibited increased MDA content in the liver. Total phenolic content present in SCE was 24.68%, whereas total flavonoids were calculated as 3.80%. SCE has a protective effect against genotoxicity and OS induced by CP."
2018,29128606,Salvianic acid A sodium protects HUVEC cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide induced oxidative injury via mitochondria-dependent pathway.,"Salvianic acid A (Danshensu) is a major water-soluble component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), which has been widely used in clinic in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of salvianic acid A sodium (SAAS) against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) oxidative injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In the antioxidant activity-assessing model, SAAS pretreatment significantly ameliorated the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by t-BHP. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) based-metabolic profiling was developed to investigate the metabolic changes of HUVEC cells in response to t-BHP and SAAS. The results revealed that t-BHP injury upregulated 13 metabolites mainly involved in tryptophan metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism which were highly correlated with mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, and 50 μM SAAS pretreatment effectively reversed these metabolic changes. Further biomedical research indicated that SAAS pretreatment reduced the t-BHP induced increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the decrease of key antioxidant enzymes through mitochondria antioxidative pathways via JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signalings. Taken together, our results suggested that SAAS may protect HUVEC cells against t-BHP induced oxidative injury via mitochondrial antioxidative defense system."
2015,24915375,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Carotenoids and Lycopenes Chemistry; Metabolism, Absorption, Nutrition, and Allied Health Claims--A Comprehensive Review.","Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most essential herbaceous plants that have been probed against various life sight related disorders owing to array of phytochemicals. It is important source of vitamin C, potassium, folic acid, and carotenoids, such as lycopene. Carotenoids are the pigments synthesized during fruit ripening and responsible for the final red color of the tomato. Consumption of tomato and tomato-based products contribute to the absorption of carotenoids and lycopenes in human serum. Lycopene is chemically acyclic carotene with 11 conjugated double bonds, normally in transconfiguration while isomerization occur in blood plasma for its better absorption. It has ability for adenosine deaminase inhibition that plays important role in the regression of tumor. Tomato also contain other active compounds, namely, neoxanthin, lutein, α-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, cyclolycopene, and β-carotene 5, 6-epoxide. These components provide synergistic effect against various threats but still need further attention of the researchers. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated the potential of tomato against variety of metabolic syndromes. Latest research highlights the relationship between consuming tomato and its products with reduced risk of various maladies like obesity, hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic attributes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer insurgences. Moreover, tomato and its bioactive components hold potential to become effective modules in diet-based regimens; however, integrated research and meta-analysis are still required to enhance meticulousness.

1992,1638024,C-reactive protein and beta-2 microglobulin produce a simple and powerful myeloma staging system.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) staging procedures are still inadequate for detection of the optimal therapeutic procedure for an individual patient. The Durie & Salmon staging system and serum beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) are used worldwide because of their easy clinical application. Other prognostic parameters, such as myeloma cell proliferative activity, are of exceeding importance, but are not as simple as standard methods. Recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to be a major growth factor for MM. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on several cell lineages, and, at the hepatocyte level, stimulates the synthesis of acute phase proteins, such as the well known C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Serum CRP concentration actually reflects the IL-6 activity. A survival analysis carried out in 162 MM patients at diagnosis showed that serum CRP level is a highly significant prognostic factor. Moreover, serum CRP was independent of serum beta 2M. This feature allowed stratification of MM patients into 3 groups according to CRP and beta 2M serum levels: (1) low risk group, CRP and beta 2M less than 6 mg/L (50% of patients); (2) intermediate risk group, CRP or beta 2M greater than or equal to 6 mg/L (35% of patients); (3) high risk group, CRP and beta 2M greater than or equal to 6 mg/L (15% of patients). Survival was 54, 27, and 6 months, respectively (P less than .0001). We thus propose a new and powerful myeloma staging system based on simple and reliable laboratory evaluations."
1999,10550483,Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of capsaicin in human neuroblastoma cells SHSY-5Y.,"Capsaicin, a natural product of Capsicum species, induces excitation of pain perception at nociceptive terminals. Our previous studies have shown that capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in cultured monkey kidneys cells (Vero cells) and in primoculture of rat astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of capsaicin on human neuroblastoma cells SHSY-5Y. The cytotoxicity has been assessed by incorporation of [(3)H]L-leucine into cellular protein in the presence of capsaicin and the genotoxicity has been evaluated using the comet assay and the fragmentation assay after incubation of neuroblastoma cells with 25-100 microM capsaicin. The concentration required to inhibit 50% of the protein synthesis (IC(50)) was found to be 60 microM after incubation with the toxin during one cellular cycle (5 days) of SHSY-5Y. The results of the comet test and DNA fragmentation assay clearly suggest that capsaicin is able to induce DNA strand breaks already with concentrations in the range of 50 microM, corresponding to 29.3 microM of capsaicin not bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Several daily topical applications of preparations containing 0.075% of capsaicin could lead to blood capsaicin concentration of this order of magnitude following transdermal passage (5% of the total quantity applied). Because DNA strand breaks or DNA lesions may affect cellular functions, lead to cell death and/or mutagenesis, our data in case of inappropriate DNA repair may have important implications for the possible health threats of capsaicin, specially in the case of misuse of capsaicin preparations in pathological situations."
2001,11482522,"Bone marrow micronucleus assay in Brown-Norway rats exposed to diphenyl-methane-4,4'-diisocyanate.","Four groups of young adult male Brown-Norway rats (strain: BN/RijHsd) were either exposed whole-body (WB) to filtered air (negative control) or to respirable aerosols of monomeric diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (MDI) at actual breathing zone concentrations of 9.2 +/- 1.5 and 118 +/- 8.6 mg/m3. One additional group was exposed to 11,0 +/- 14.4 mg/m3 MDI using a nose-only (NO) mode. Exposure was 1 h/day, one exposure per week on 3 consecutive weeks. MDI aerosols were generated using either a condensation (WB) or a dispersion-condensation (NO) principle with resultant MMADs of 2.4-3.1 microm and 1.2 microm (GSD approximately l.5), respectively. Humidity ranged from approximately 40% (WB) to approximately 5% (NO). Positive controls received cyclophosphamide and colcemid. Micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) were counted in bone marrow smears prepared after the final exposure on post-exposure days 1, 2 and 7 and stained with acridine orange or Wright-Giemsa. Both the WB-exposure regimen and the 7-day sampling time point were based upon a previous study in which a significant increase in MN-PCE was reported to occur. Rats exposed to 118 (WB) and 110 mg/m3 MDI (NO) exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including hypothermia, and increased lung weights when compared to WB-exposed rats. The intensity of changes appeared to be slightly more pronounced in NO-exposed rats. At no time point did this study provide any evidence of an MDI-induced effect on the frequency of MN-PCE. No differences in outcome existed following staining with acridine orange or Wright-Giemsa. There was an absence of any effect on the frequency of mast cells and their frequency was low enough not to interfere with the outcome of study. Positive control groups exhibited significant increases in MN-PCE. In summary, monomeric MDI aerosol did not induce cytogenetic damage in Brown-Norway rats when investigated according to current testing guidelines."
2016,27374516,Effect of chemical stress on germination of cv Dalia bean (Phaseolus vularis L.) as an alternative to increase antioxidant and nutraceutical compounds in sprouts.,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chitosan (CH), salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at different concentrations on the antinutritional and nutraceutical content, as well as the antioxidant capacity of bean sprouts (cv Dalia). All elicitors at medium and high concentrations reduced the antinutritional content of lectins (48%), trypsin inhibitor (57%), amylase inhibitor (49%) and phytic acid (56%). Sprouts treated with CH, SA and H2O2 (7μM; 1 and 2mM, and 30mM respectively) increased the content of phenolic compounds (1.8-fold), total flavonoids (3-fold), saponins (1.8-fold) and antioxidant capacity (37%). Furthermore, the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed an increase of several nutraceutical compounds in bean sprouts treated with SA such as coumaric (8.5-fold), salicylic (115-fold), gallic (25-fold) and caffeic (1.7-fold) acids, as well as epigallocatechin (63-fold), rutin (41-fold) and quercetin (16.6-fold) flavonoids. The application of elicitors in bean seed during sprouting enhances their nutraceutical properties. "
2017,28156181,Formation of multimeric antibodies for self-delivery of active monomers.,"Proteins and peptides have been used as drugs for almost a century. Technological advances in the past 30 years have enabled the production of pure, stable proteins in vast amounts. In contrast, administration of proteins based on their native active conformation (and thus necessitating the use of subcutaneous injections) has remained solely unchanged. The therapeutic anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG) Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a first line of the treatment for breast cancer. Chicken IgY is a commercially important polyclonal antibody (Ab). These Abs were examined for their ability to self-assemble and form ordered aggregates, by several biophysical methods. Atomic force microscopy analyses revealed the formation of multimeric nanostructures. The biological activity of multimeric IgG or IgY particles was retained and restored, in a dilution/time-dependent manner. IgG activity was confirmed by a binding assay using HER2 + human breast cancer cell line, SKBR3, while IgY activity was confirmed by ELISA assay using the VP2 antigen. Competition assay with native Herceptin antibodies demonstrated that the binding availability of the multimer formulation remained unaffected. Under long incubation periods, IgG multimers retained five times more activity than native IgG. In conclusion, the multimeric antibody formulations can serve as a storage depositories and sustained-release particles. These two important characteristics make this formulation promising for future novel administration protocols and altogether bring to light a different conceptual approach for the future use of therapeutic proteins as self-delivery entities rather than conjugated/encapsulated to other bio-compounds."
2017,28879719,"Interleukin-24 Concentrations Not Related with Age, but Affect Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines Differently in Healthy Donors.","Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is expressed at different levels in a variety of tumor tissues and matched normal tissues and is regarded as a potential tumor biomarker as its expression levels in tumor tissues are associated with tumor patient prognosis. At present, the expression level of IL-24 in healthy human peripheral blood is unknown.In this study, 1940 blood samples were collected using different processing methods from healthy donors. ELISA was used to detect IL-24 concentrations.The results showed that processing methods had the greatest influence on test results, with the highest IL24 concentration in EDTA plasma and the lowest in sodium citrate plasma. Lengths of storage time at 4°C had no obvious effect on IL-24 test results, and IL-24 in peripheral blood was stable for 15 days. IL-24 concentration in the sera of healthy donors showed no associations with age, blood glucose, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, carcinoembryonic antigen, absolute lymphocyte counts, alpha fetoprotein, white blood cells, thyroid stimulating hormone, or cereal third transaminase. We also confirmed that IL-24 expression level in the blood of healthy subjects was positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), but negatively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.We observed that sample processing methods influence the detection of IL-24 levels as EDTA plasma had the highest IL-24 concentration, and citric acid sodium, the lowest. Age, gender, and physical and chemical indicators were not related to IL-24 concentrations. We confirmed the IL-24 concentration was positively related to IL-6 and TNF-α and negatively to IL-10."
2019,30797353,Resistant starch formation through intrahelical V-complexes between polymeric proanthocyanidins and amylose.,"Reducing starch digestibility can significantly benefit efforts to combat obesity and associated chronic diseases. Polymeric proanthocyanidins (PA) form complexes with starch via unknown mechanisms, resulting in dramatically decreased starch digestibility. We hypothesized that V-type complexes are involved in these interactions. Sorghum derived PA was complexed with amylose, amylopectin, and granular maize starches in regular and deuterated solvents, and structural properties and in vitro digestibility of the complexes investigated. Based on iodine binding, X-ray diffraction patterns, crystallinity, and thermal properties, we demonstrated, for the first time, that type II semi-crystalline V-complexes are formed between amylose and PA. Furthermore, suppression of H-bonding led to amorphous complexes, suggesting extensive H-bonding facilitate and/or stabilize the V-complexes. We speculate that the complexation involves inclusion of B-rings of the PA units into the amylose helical cavity. The V-complex formation significantly increased resistant starch in gelatinized normal starch and pure amylose (by 35-45%), indicating likely physiological benefits."
2017,28372177,Hydrophilic interaction chromatography and evaporative light scattering detection for the determination of polar analytes in Belgian endive.,"Belgian endive (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum Hegi), a popular produce in northern Europe, has been thoroughly studied in regard to its bitter sesquiterpene lactones content. Much less is known about on its sweetness and crunchiness, which are typically linked to the content of polar compounds such as sugars, organic acids and salts. Through HILIC-HPLC-MS, it was shown that simple sugars, amino acids, and potassium chloride are abundant in Belgian endive extracts. Subsequently, a HILIC-HPLC-ELSD method for the analysis of such compounds with run times below six minutes was developed. Recoveries varied between 80 and 110% and an average reproducibility was 7.5RSD%. Finally, the method was applied to the study of three difference Belgian endive varieties. Takine, a variety known for its sweet taste, was found to contain significantly higher levels of fructose, and lower levels of potassium and glutamine."
2013,24222116,Therapeutic efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma by boric acid-mediated boron neutron capture therapy in a rat model.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor with poor prognosis. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) may provide an alternative therapy for HCC. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of boric acid (BA)-mediated BNCT for HCC in a rat model.The pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of BA in N1S1 tumor-bearing rats were analyzed. Rats were injected with 25 mg B/kg body weight via tail veins before neutron irradiation at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor, and the efficacy of BNCT was evaluated from the tumor size, tumor blood flow, and biochemical analyses.HCC-bearing rats administered BNCT showed reductions in tumor size on ultrasound imaging, as well as an obvious reduction in the distribution of tumor blood flow. The lesion located in livers had disappeared on the 80th day after BNCT; a recovery of values to normal levels was also recorded.BA-mediated BNCT is a promising alternative for liver cancer therapy since the present study demonstrated the feasibility of curing a liver tumor and restoring liver function in rats. Efforts are underway to investigate the histopathological features and the detailed mechanisms of BA-mediated BNCT."
1993,8368602,Immunologic changes in Ostertagia ostertagi-infected calves treated strategically with an anthelmintic.,"Immunomodulation by Ostertagia ostertagi and the effects of strategic anthelmintic treatments were studied in 3 groups of 6 calves each: an infected group, inoculated with 100,000 third-stage larvae (L3)/calf at 1 and 28 days; an infected-treated group, similarly inoculated, but treated with ivermectin 9 days after each inoculation; and a noninfected control group. Calves were grazed on 2 previously clean pastures, with the infected and infected-treated calves sharing 1 pasture. All calves were inoculated at 12 weeks with Brucella abortus and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis vaccines, and at 13 weeks with a soluble O ostertagi L3 extract (SLE). Infected and infected-treated calves had lower blood lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin than did control calves at 2, 4, and 14 weeks, whereas the infected calves had higher responses at 6 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Responses to pokeweed mitogen followed a similar pattern, whereas those to SLE were low in all calves. Infected and infected-treated calves had increased values of IgG1 to excretory-secretory antigens of L4 larvae, but no changes in the values of IgG1 to SLE. They also had lower values of IgG and IgM to B abortus and antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis at 13 weeks. The infected-treated calves, however, had higher blood lymphocyte and monocyte counts and lower eosinophil count than did infected calves. They also had reduced abomasal mucosa thickness, abomasal wall weight, and abomasal lymph node weight than infected calves. It was concluded that O ostertagi causes nonspecific suppression of cellular and humoral immunity, hypersensitivity reactions coexisted with immunosuppression, and strategic anthelmintic treatments attenuated hypersensitivity reactions and initiated better immune responses."
2015,26220068,In vitro effect of bergamot (Citrus bergamia) juice against cagA-positive and-negative clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori.,"Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma as over half of the world's population is colonized with this gram-negative bacterium. Due to the increasing antibiotic resistance, its eradication rates fails in a great portion of patients. A number of studies showed that molecules largely distributed in commonly consumed fruits and vegetables may have antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of bergamot juice (BJ) against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. The potential therapeutic combination between BJ and the antibiotics amoxicillin (AMX), clarithromycin (CLA) and metronidazole (MTZ) has also been evaluated.The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BJ, AMX, CLA and MTZ against 2 ATCC and 32 clinical isolates of H. pylori was assayed according to CLSI. The checkerboard method was used to determine the efficacy of the association BJ with the three reference antibiotics. Killing curves were performed on the two cagA-positive ATCC strains of H. pylori (ATCC 43504 and ATCC 49503), on the clinical isolate cagA-positive HP6 strain of H. pylori and on the clinical isolate cagA-negative HP61 strain of H. pylori.BJ (2.5%, v/v) inhibited the growth of 50% of the H. pylori clinical isolates, whereas 5% (v/v) inhibited 90%. AMX was the most effective antibiotic against the reference strains and the clinical isolates, followed by CLA and MTZ. In the combination assays, synergism was observed between BJ and AMX and between BJ and MTZ against both the reference strains and the clinical isolates. Indifference was observed between BJ and CLA.BJ was effective in vitro against H. pylori and the genotype status of the clinical strains may have an impact on its susceptibility. The synergistic combination of BJ and antibiotics could be used to prevent or treat resistance."
2016,27114365,Neuroprotective effects of adenosine isolated from Cordyceps cicadae against oxidative and ER stress damages induced by glutamate in PC12 cells.,"Glutamate has been proven to induce oxidative stress through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased calcium overload which results in neuronal injury, development of neurodegenerative diseases and death. Adenosine is one of the bioactive nucleosides found in Cordyceps cicadae and it has displayed several pharmacological activities including neuroprotection. In this study, the protective effects of adenosine from C. cicadae against glutamate-induce oxidative stress in PC12 cells were evaluated. The exposure of PC12 cells to glutamate (5mM) induced the formation of ROS, increased Ca(2+) influx, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and up regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bax. However, pretreatment with adenosine markedly increased cell viability, decreased the elevated levels of ROS and Ca(2+) induced by glutamate. Furthermore adenosine increased the activities of GSH-Px and SOD, as well as retained mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and reduced the expression of ERK, p38, and JNK. Overall, our results suggest that adenosine may be a promising potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. "
2018,29491217,Nelumbo nucifera Seed Extract Promotes Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster.,"The sleep-promoting effects of the water extract of Nelumbo nucifera seeds (NNE) were investigated in an invertebrate model. The effects of NNE on the subjective nighttime activity, sleep episodes, and sleep time were determined using Drosophila melanogaster and locomotor activity monitoring systems in basal and caffeine-induced arousal conditions. The movements of fruit flies were analyzed using the Noldus EthoVision-XT system, and the levels of neuromodulators were analyzed using HPLC. Expression of neuromodulator receptors was analyzed using real-time PCR. NNE was shown to contain neurotransmission-related components; γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (2.33±0.22 mg/g), tryptophan (2.00±0.06 mg/g), quinidine (0.55±0.33 mg/g), and neferine (0.16±0.01 mg/g). The total activity of flies during nighttime was decreased by 52% with 1.0% NNE treatment. In the individual and collective conditions, the subjective nighttime activities (45/38%) and sleep bouts (20/14%) of flies was significantly decreased with NNE treatment, while total sleep times (10/27%) were significantly increased. This sleep-promoting effect is more pronounced in caffeine-treated conditions; the nighttime activity of flies was reduced by 53%, but total sleep time was increased by 60%. Our video-tracking analysis showed a significant decrease of the moving distance and velocity of flies by NNE. This NNE-mediated sleep-promoting effect was associated with up-regulation of GABAA/GABAB and serotonin receptors. The NNE-mediated increase of GABA content was identified in flies. These results demonstrate that NNE effectively promotes sleep in flies by regulating the GABAergic/serotonergic neuromodulators, and could be an alternative agent for sleep promotion."
2014,24939647,A legume product fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae modulates cutaneous atopic dermatitis-like inflammation in mice.,"Isoflavone-containing soy products modulate allergic inflammation in mice. In our previously study, IFN-γ and IL-10 production increased in mice fed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae legume fermented product (SCLFP), demonstrating that SCLFP had immunomodulatory activity. In this study, we tested the anti-inflammatory effects of SCLFP in a mouse model of cutaneous atopic dermatitis inflammation induced by epicutaneous sensitization.Epicutaneous exposure to protein allergens plus Staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced a T helper (Th)-2-dominant immune response as well as cutaneous atopic dermatitis-like inflammation in BALB/c mice. The thickness of the skin epithelium, eosinophil migration, and T helper responses were determined in patched skin and draining lymph nodes of mice fed with and without SCLFP.Epicutaneous exposure to protein allergens plus Staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced a T helper (Th)-2-dominant immune response as well as cutaneous atopic dermatitis-like inflammation in BALB/c mice. SCLFP feeding attenuated this cutaneous Th2 response, as evidenced by decreased thickening of the epidermis, less eosinophil infiltration, and lower levels of IL-5, IL-13, and CXCL11 expression compared to controls. Oral administration of SCLFP also modulated Th1 responses in draining lymph nodes, with lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 expression.Oral intake of SCLFP modulated the induced Th2 inflammatory responses in skin and might have potential applications for the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis."
2006,16595923,"Effects of amelioration of total flavonoids from stems and leaves of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi on cognitive deficits, neuronal damage and free radicals disorder induced by cerebral ischemia in rats.","Previous studies reported that the total flavonoids from the stems and leaves of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (TFSS) could enhance and improve learning and memory abilities in experimental animals, and reduce the neuronal pathologic alterations induced by some reagents in mice. The present study examined whether TFSS can improve memory dysfunction, neuronal damage, and abnormal free radicals induced by permanent cerebral ischemia in rats. The permanent cerebral ischemic model in rats was produced by bilateral ligation of the common carotid arteries. The influence of permanent cerebral ischemia on learning and memory was determined in the Morris water maze. The neuronal damage in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was assessed by the neuronal morphologic observations. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were measured using thiobarbituric acid, nitrate reductase, xanthine-xanthine oxidase, and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods, respectively. In learning and memory performance tests, cerebral ischemic rats always required a longer latency time to find the hidden platform and spent a shorter time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze. TFSS 17.5-70 mg.kg(-1) daily orally administered to ischemic rats for 20 d, from day 16-35 after operation differently reduced the prolonged latency and increased swimming time spent in the target quadrant. In neuronal morphologic observations, daily oral TFSS 17.5-70 mg.kg(-1) for 21 d, from day 16-36 after operation markedly inhibited the ischemia-induced neuronal damage. In addition, the increased contents of MDA and NO, and SOD activity, and the decreased activity of CAT in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex induced by cerebral ischemia were differently reversed. The reference drug piracetam (140 mg.kg(-1) per day for 20-21 d) similarly improved impaired memory and neuronal damage but had no significant effects on free radicals in ligated rats. TFSS can improve memory deficits and neuronal damage in rats after permanent cerebral ischemia, which may be beneficial in the treatment of cerebrovascular dementia."
2019,31248040,Physiological and Biochemical Responses of Pearl Millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) Seedlings Exposed to Silver Nitrate (AgNO3) and Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs).,": A rapid and continuous growth of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) via their precursor ""silver nitrate"" (AgNO3) has increased their environmental risk because of their unsafe discharge into the surrounding environment. Both have damaging effects on plants and induce oxidative stress. In the present study, differential responses in the morpho-physiological and biochemical profiles of P. glaucum (L.) seedlings exposed to various doses of AgNPs and AgNO3 were studied. Both have forms of Ag accelerated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which adversely affected the membrane stability as a result of their enhanced accumulation, and resulted in a significant reduction in growth, that is, root length, shoot length, fresh and dry biomass, and relative water content. AgNO3 possessed a higher degree of toxicity owing to its higher accumulation than AgNPs, and induced changes in the antioxidants' enzyme activity: superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalases (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, as well as proline content, total phenolic, and total flavonoids contents (TFCs) under all tested treatments (mM). A decline in photosynthetic pigments such as total chlorophyll content and carotenoid content and alterations in quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photochemical (qP), and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) indicated the blockage of the electron transport chain (ETC), which led to a significant inhibition of photosynthesis. Interestingly, seedlings exposed to AgNPs showed less damaging effects on P. glaucum (L.) seedlings, resulting in relatively lower oxidative stress in contrast to AgNO3. Our results revealed that AgNO3 and AgNPs possessed differential phytotoxic effects on P. glaucum (L.) seedlings, including their mechanism of uptake, translocation, and action. The present findings may be useful in phytotoxic research to design strategies that minimize the adverse effects of AgNPs and AgNO3 on crops, especially in the agriculture sector."
,10953339,"Modulation of bcl-2 and cytotoxicity by licochalcone-A, a novel estrogenic flavonoid.","Herbal therapies are commonly used by patients with cancer, despite little understanding about their clinical and biological activity. We recently demonstrated that the herbal combination PC-SPES, which contains licorice root, had potent estrogenic activity in vitro, in animals, and in patients with prostate cancer. Licochalcone-A (LA) is one flavonoid extracted from licorice root with antiparasitic and anti-tumor activity, but the effect on the human estrogen receptor and mechanism of anti-tumor activity is unknown. Recent studies demonstrated that the mechanism of cytotoxic effect by some estrogens may involve modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. In the present study, we determined if LA had estrogenic activity, anti-tumor activity, and modulated the apoptotic protein bcl-2 in human cell lines derived from acute leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. A yeast growth-based assay under the control of the human estrogen receptor (hER) demonstrated that LA was a phytoestrogen. A cell viability assay demonstrated that LA had anti-tumor activity in all cell lines tested and enhanced the effect of paclitaxel and vinblastine chemotherapy. LA induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines, as demonstrated by cleavage of PARP, the substrate of ICE-like proteases. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that LA decreased the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 and altered the bcl-2/bax ratio in favor of apoptosis. In contrast, the parent compound chalcone or estradiol did not decrease bc1-2 expression. Therefore, these data demonstrate that LA is a phytoestrogen with anti-tumor activity and is capable of modulating bcl-2 protein expression. The modulation of bcl-2 may be dependent on specific structural differences between LA and the parent compound chalcone and independent of LA estrogenicity."
2012,22185653,Cetirizine release from cyclodextrin formulated compressed chewing gum.,"Beside the efficient effect on masking cetirizine bitter taste, the cyclodextrins (CDs) as well could have influence on the release from the formulation. In vitro release profiles of cetirizine from compressed chewing gums containing α-, β- and γ-CD were investigated using a three cell chewing apparatus. Different cetirizine/CD formulations were produced and analysed with respect to type of CD (α-, β- and γ-CD), the molar ratio between cetirizine and CD and the formulation of cetirizine (complex or physical mixture). Release experiments from all compressed chewing gum formulations gave similar release patterns, but with variations in the total amount released. Chewing gum formulated with cetirizine alone, demonstrated a release of 75% after 8 min of chewing. The presence of CDs resulted in increased cetirizine release. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that parameters with the most important influence on the release were the molar ratio of cetirizine/CD (P < 0.05) and the formulation of cetirizine/CD (complex or physical mixture) (P < 0.05). The compressed chewing gum formulations with 1:5 molar ratio of cetirizine/CD in complexed form demonstrated the highest release. Even though the statistical analysis (ANOVA) demonstrated significance in the release (P < 0.05) for the complex/physical mixture factor, this difference was negligible compared to the release from chewing gums containing cetirizine without CD. This makes physical mixtures suitable for use in cetirizine/CD formulations instead the complexes with respect to release yield. Thus unnecessary expenses for the complex preformulation may be avoided."
2002,12593759,"Inhibition of the microsomal metabolism of 1,8-cineole in the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) by terpenes and other chemicals.","1. Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) ingest large amounts of terpenes in their diet of Eucalyptus leaf. Previously, we showed that dietary terpenes induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) responsible for their metabolism. The present study examined the effects of various CYP inhibitors on the metabolism of 1,8-cineole, the major dietary terpene, by liver microsomes from the possum and rat. 2. Ketoconazole inhibited the major reactions of terpene-induced microsomes in both species: 9-hydroxylation in the possum and 2-hydroxylation in the rat. This suggests the involvement of CYP3A enzymes, although in the possum there was a lack of the expected inhibition by troleandomycin or activation by alpha-naphthoflavone, highlighting the differences between species in CYP forms. Diethyldithiocarbamate also inhibited 9-hydroxylation in the possum, indicating that a CYP2E1-like enzyme contributes to this reaction. 3. Three other dietary terpenes were potent competitive inhibitors of 9-hydroxylation in the possum. K(i) ( micro M) (mean +/- SE, n = 4) were: alpha-pinene, 4.4 +/- 1.1; limonene, 7.8 +/- 2.1; p-cymene, 44.3 +/- 11.2; cuminyl alcohol (a p-cymene metabolite), 6.0 +/- 0.8. It appears likely that p-cymene acts via its metabolite to inhibit 1,8-cineole metabolism. 4. Inhibitory interactions between dietary terpenes, as well as other plant secondary compounds, may impose a significant constraint on foliage consumption in the common brushtail possum, therefore explaining the obligatory generalist nature of this browsing marsupial and other generalist herbivores."
2016,26433283,A simplified HPLC method for determination of tryptophan in some cereals and legumes.,"In the present study, a simple analytical method is proposed for determining tryptophan, and method is validated on some cereal and legume samples. In the method alkaline hydrolysis of proteins was used due to the destruction of tryptophan structure during acid hydrolysis. Following alkaline hydrolysis (120°C for 12h), hydrolysates are filtered through ashless filter paper and pH values are adjusted with hydrochloric acid solution. Separation and detection of tryptophan are performed on a reversed-phase column with fluorescence detection within 10min by using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and acetate buffer of pH 6.3 (1:9, v/v). For determination of tryptophan content, the procedure described in the study offers an alternative analysis method by enabling high speed analysis and the use of simple extraction process to the other available methods.

2019,30382478,Dietary Zinc-Amino Acid Complex Does Not Affect Markers of Mammary Epithelial Integrity or Heat Stability of Milk in Mid-Lactating Cows.,"Supplying dietary zinc in excess of traditional requirements has clear impacts on the gut epithelium, but little research has explored whether similar impacts on the mammary epithelium may occur. Our objective was to determine the effects of supplemental Zn sources, in excess of minimal requirements, on markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood and in milk as well as the heat stability of milk in mid-lactation cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 ± 21 days in milk and 51 ± 3 kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21 days, with 17 days allowed for diet adaptation and 4 days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (34.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (56.5 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 plus 1.13 g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na+ and K+, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance. Treatments had no effect on milk N fractions or heat coagulation time. This study provided no evidence that supplemental Zn above the established requirements can improve blood-milk epithelial barrier or heat stability of milk in healthy mid-lactation dairy cows."
2007,17473054,Production of sex steroid hormones from DHEA in articular chondrocyte of rats.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor of sex steroid hormones, is synthesized by cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 and 17alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 mainly from cholesterol and converted to testosterone and estrogen by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD), 17beta-HSD, and aromatase cytochrome P-450. Although sex steroid hormones have important effects in the protection of articular cartilage, it is unclear whether articular cartilage has a local steroidogenic enzymatic machinery capable of metabolizing DHEA. This study was aimed to clarify whether steroidogenesis-related enzymes are expressed in articular chondrocytes, whether expression levels are changed by DHEA, and whether articular chondrocytes are capable of synthesizing sex steroid hormones from DHEA. Articular chondrocytes isolated from adult rats were cultured with DHEA for 3 days. All of the mRNA expressions of steroidogenesis-related enzymes were detected in cultured articular chondrocytes of rats, but the mRNA expression levels of testosterone and estradiol in cultured media increased after the addition of DHEA. These findings provided the first evidence that articular chondrocytes expressed steroidogenesis-related enzyme genes and that they are capable of locally synthesizing sex steroid hormones locally from DHEA."
2012,22382318,Mechanism-based inhibition of recombinant human cytochrome P450 3A4 by tomato juice extract.,"This study investigates whether tomato juice can inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated drug metabolism. Three commercially available, additive-free tomato juices, along with homogenized fresh tomato, were analyzed for their ability to inhibit testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity using human recombinant CYP3A4. Results were compared to that of grapefruit juice. Ethyl acetate extracts of the tomato juices moderately reduced residual activity of CYP3A4 testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity by 19.3-26.2% with 0-min preincubation. Residual activity was strongly reduced by 69.9-83.5% at 20-min preincubation, a reduction similar to that of grapefruit juice extract, known to contain constituents of mechanism-based inhibitors. One juice extract (tomato juice C) showed irreversible dose- and preincubation time-dependent and partial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 activity. Furthermore, we examined whether the CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of tomato juice was substrate dependent by examining midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity and nifedipine oxidation activity, in addition to testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity. Tomato juice showed a potent inhibitory effect on nifedipine oxidation activity, which was comparable to that on testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity; however, it showed a weak inhibitory effect on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity. We conclude that tomato juice contains one or more mechanism-based and competitive inhibitor(s) of CYP3A4. Additionally, significant CYP3A4 inhibitory activity did not result from lycopene, a major compound in tomato. Although the active compound was uncertain, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitory activity was observed in other solanaceous plants, i.e., potato, eggplant, sweet pepper, and capsicum. Therefore, responsible compounds in tomato are likely commonly shared among solanaceous vegetables."
2013,23116492,Changes in regional brain monoaminergic activity and temporary down-regulation in stress response from dietary supplementation with l-tryptophan in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).,"The brain monoamines serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and dopamine (DA) both play an integrative role in behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to challenges, and comparative models suggest common mechanisms for dietary modulation of transmission by these signal substances in vertebrates. Previous studies in teleosts demonstrate that 7 d of dietary administration with L-tryptophan (Trp), the direct precursor of 5-HT, suppresses the endocrine stress response. The present study investigated how long the suppressive effects of a Trp-enriched feed regimen, at doses corresponding to two, three or four times the Trp levels in commercial feed, last in juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) when the fish are reintroduced to a diet with standard amino acid composition. We also wanted to determine whether Trp supplementation induced changes in brain monoaminergic neurochemistry in those forebrain structures innervated by DA and 5-HTergic neurons, by measuring regional activity of DA and 5-HT in the lateral pallial regions (Dl) of the telencephalon and nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT) of the hypothalamus. Dietary Trp resulted in a dose-dependent suppression in plasma cortisol among fish exposed to confinement stress on the first day following experimental diet; however, such an effect was not observed at 2 or 6 d after Trp treatment. Feeding the fish with moderate Trp doses also evoked a general increase in DA and 5-HT-ergic activity, suggesting that these neural circuits within the NLT and Dl may be indirectly involved in regulating the acute stress response."
2007,17371531,"Effect of honey on CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzyme activity in healthy human volunteers.","Honey is a common food supplement but not many studies have studied honey and drug interaction. This study investigates the influence of 7 days of honey administration on the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 drug-metabolizing enzymes in healthy volunteers by using appropriate biomarker and probe drugs. A within-group pharmacokinetic study was done in 12 healthy volunteers. Urine samples (0-8 hr) were collected after administration of 30 mg of oral dextromethorphan (probe drug for CYP2D6) for analysis of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan. A plasma sample (4 hr) was collected after administration of 200 mg of oral proguanil (probe drug for CYP2C19) for the analysis of proguanil and cycloguanil. Urine samples (0-24 hr) were collected for the analysis of 6beta-hydroxycortisol (biomarker for CYP3A4). The volunteers were administered honey for 7 days. Subsequently blood and urine samples were collected after drug dosing as before. These samples were analysed for drug and metabolite concentrations in urine and plasma using high performance liquid chromatography method. Seven days of honey administration resulted in statistically significant increase in 24-hr urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol. However, the metabolic ratios of dextromethorphan and proguanil were not significantly altered after 7 days of honey administration. Honey obtained from Western Ghats of southern India may induce CYP3A4 enzyme activity but not CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzyme activities."
2009,19181486,Serenoa repens associated with Urtica dioica (ProstaMEV) and curcumin and quercitin (FlogMEV) extracts are able to improve the efficacy of prulifloxacin in bacterial prostatitis patients: results from a prospective randomised study.,"We report the results of a prospective randomised study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Serenoa repens, Urtica dioica (ProstaMEV), quercitin and curcumin (FlogMEV) extracts associated with prulifloxacin in patients affected by chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP). From a whole population of 284 patients, 143 patients affected by CBP [National Institutes of Health (NIH) class II prostatitis] were enrolled. All patients received prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 14 days, in accordance with antibiogram results. Patients were split into two groups: Group A received prulifloxacin associated with ProstaMEV and FlogMEV; Group B received only antibiotic therapy. Microbiological and clinical efficacies were tested by two follow-up visits at 1 month and 6 months, respectively. Quality of life (QoL) was measured using the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI) and International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires. Group A comprised 106 patients and Group B comprised 37 patients. One month after treatment, 89.6% of patients who had received prulifloxacin associated with ProstaMEV and FlogMEV did not report any symptoms related to CBP, whilst only 27% of patients who received antibiotic therapy alone were recurrence-free (P < 0.0001). Significant differences were found between groups in terms of symptoms and QoL (P < 0.0001 for both). Six months after treatment, no patients in Group A had recurrence of disease whilst two patients in Group B did. Questionnaire results demonstrated statistically significant differences between groups (all P < 0.001). The association of S. repens, U. dioica (ProstaMEV), quercitin and curcumin (FlogMEV) extracts is able to improve the clinical efficacy of prulifloxacin in patients affected by CBP."
2013,23768324,"Spectroscopic studies on the interaction of sodium benzoate, a food preservative, with calf thymus DNA.","The interaction between sodium benzoate (SB) and calf thymus DNA in simulated physiological buffer (pH 7.4) using acridine orange (AO) dye as a fluorescence probe, was investigated by UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy along with DNA melting studies and viscosity measurements. An expanded UV-Vis spectral data matrix was resolved by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) approach. The equilibrium concentration profiles and the pure spectra for SB, DNA and DNA-SB complex from the high overlapping composite response were simultaneously obtained. The results indicated that SB could bind to DNA, and hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds played a vital role in the binding process. Moreover, SB was able to quench the fluorescence of DNA-AO complex through a static procedure. The quenching observed was indicative of an intercalative mode of interaction between SB and DNA, which was supported by melting studies, viscosity measurements and CD analysis."
1993,8116936,Prevention of pathophysiologic and immunomodulatory effects of gastrointestinal nematodiasis in calves by use of strategic anthelmintic treatments.,"Effects of strategic anthelmintic treatment on pathophysiologic and immunomologic changes induced by infection with Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora were studied in 2 groups, of 12 calves each: an infected group, inoculated with 200,000 mixed O ostertagi and C oncophora third-stage larvae (L3) on day 1; and an infected-treated group, similarly inoculated, but treated with ivermectin at 9 and 33 days. All calves were also inoculated at 12 weeks with Brucella abortus vaccine, at 13 weeks with bovine rhinotracheitis vaccine (bovine herpesvirus 1), and at 14 weeks with a soluble O ostertagi L3 extract, then were allowed to graze on a contaminated pasture. Four calves from each group were slaughtered at 7, 11, and 19 weeks of the study. Calves of the infected group had significantly (P < 0.05) lower weight gain than did those in the infected-treated group (60.90 kg vs 75.86 kg). They also had high plasma pepsinogen and serum gastrin values, and low serum albumin concentration from 2 or 4 weeks. Calves in the infected-treated group had steady weight gain and no significant changes in albumin and gastrin values. They also had less severe abomasal lesions and higher carcass yield. Compared with calves of the infected-treated group, those of the infected group had significantly (P < 0.05) lower blood lymphocyte reactivity to phytohemagglutinin at 14 and 16 weeks, to concanavalin A at 10 weeks, to pokeweed mitogen at 14 weeks, and to soluble O ostertagi L3 extract at 2, 4, and 14 weeks.

2014,25480138,A curious case of cholestasis: oral terbinafine associated with cholestatic jaundice and subsequent erythema nodosum.,"Terbinafine is a commonly prescribed antifungal agent used in the treatment of trichophytic onychomycosis and chronic cutaneous mycosis that are resistant to other treatments. This case report highlights a rarely documented but important adverse hepatic reaction that was caused by the use of oral terbinafine. A woman in her thirties presented with a 3-week history of jaundice, malaise, itching, nausea, decreased appetite, weight loss, dark orange urine and intermittent non-radiating epigastric pain. She had recently finished a 3-week course of oral terbinafine for a fungal nail infection. Liver biopsy findings were consistent with chronic active hepatitis secondary to a drug reaction. A few days after initial presentation, the patient developed erythema nodosum. Delayed development of erythema nodosum secondary to terbinafine could not be excluded."
2010,20412609,Small quantities of carotenoid-rich tropical green leafy vegetables indigenous to Africa maintain vitamin A status in Mongolian gerbils ( Meriones unguiculatus).,"Leafy vegetables are important sources of provitamin A carotenoids. Information on their ability to provide vitamin A is often misleading because of the methodology used to assess bioefficacy. Mongolian gerbils were used to evaluate the bioefficacy of provitamin A carotenoids in tropical leafy vegetables (i.e. Solanum nigrum, Moringa oleifera, Vernonia calvoana and Hibiscus cannabinus) that are indigenous to Africa. Gerbils (n 67) were vitamin A-depleted for 5 weeks. After a baseline kill (n 7), the gerbils were weight-matched and assigned to six treatment groups (n 10; four vegetable groups; negative and positive controls). For 4 weeks, the treatments included 35 nmol vitamin A (theoretical concentrations based on 100 % bioefficacy) in the form of vegetables or retinyl acetate. In addition to their diets, the control and vegetable groups received daily doses of oil, while the vitamin A group received retinyl acetate in oil matched to prior day intake. Serum and livers were analysed for vitamin A using HPLC. Serum retinol concentrations did not differ among groups, but total liver vitamin A of the vitamin A and vegetable groups were higher than that of the negative control group (P < 0.0001). Liver beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase-1 expression levels were determined for two vegetable groups and were similar to the positive and negative controls. Conversion factors for the different leafy vegetables were between 1.9 and 2.3 microg beta-carotene equivalents to 1 microg retinol. Small quantities of these vegetables maintained vitamin A status in gerbils through efficient bioconversion of beta-carotene to retinol."
2011,20887714,Low molecular weight fucoidan prevents intimal hyperplasia in rat injured thoracic aorta through the modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression.,"The therapeutic potential of low molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweed was investigated on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and human vascular endothelial cell (HUV-EC-C) proliferation and migration in vitro and in a rat model of intimal hyperplasia. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to balloon injury in the thoracic aorta followed by two weeks' treatment with either LMWF (5mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Morphological analysis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining at day 14 indicated that LMWF prevented intimal hyperplasia in rat thoracic aorta as compared with vehicle (neo-intima area, 3±0.50mm(2) versus 5±0.30mm(2), P<0.01). In situ zymography showed that LMWF significantly decreased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in the neo-intima compared to vehicle. The in vitro study demonstrated that 10μg/ml LMWF increased HUV-EC-C migration by 45±5% but reduced VSMC migration by 40±3%. LMWF also increased MMP-2 mRNA expression in HUV-EC-Cs and reduced it in VSMCs. MMP-2 level in the conditioned medium from cells incubated with 10μg/ml LMWF was 5.4-fold higher in HUV-EC-Cs, but 6-fold lower in VSMCs than in untreated control cells. Furthermore, decreasing MMP-2 expression in HUV-EC-Cs or VSMCs by RNA interference resulted in reduced LMWF-induced effects on cell migration. In conclusion, LMWF increased HUV-EC-C migration and decreased VSMC migration in vitro. In vivo, this natural compound reduced the intimal hyperplasia in the rat aortic wall after balloon injury. Therefore, LMWF could be of interest for the prevention of intimal hyperplasia."
2019,30864855,Fermented Cordyceps militaris Extract Ameliorates Hepatosteatosis via Activation of Fatty Acid Oxidation.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a progressive disease involving the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. In this study, we investigated the anti-hepatosteatosis effects of fermented Cordyceps militaris extract (CME) in AML-12 hepatocytes. Although the levels of adenosine and cordycepin were reduced in the extracts of CM grown on germinated soybean (GSCE) and fermented CM grown on germinated soybean (GSC) by Pediococcus pentosaceus ON188 (ON188E), the expression of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) genes were upregulated only by GSC-ON188E treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a lipogenic gene, stearoyl Coenzyme A desaturase 1, was downregulated by ON188E. Formation of intracellular lipid droplets by the addition of oleic acid was reduced by ON188E to levels observed in WY14643-treated cells. When cells were treated with ON188E, sphingosine kinase 2 mainly responsible for hepatic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis was upregulated and S1P was elevated. Collectively, the fermented GSC extract activates FAO through elevation of S1P synthesis and has potential as a therapeutic for hepatosteatosis."
2020,31365834,Combined consumption of a single high-dose vitamin A supplement with provision of vitamin A fortified oil to households maintains adequate milk retinol concentrations for 6 months in lactating Moroccan women.,"In Morocco, postpartum women systematically receive a single, high dose of vitamin A (VA; 200 000 IU) within the first month of giving birth and vegetable oil is fortified to increase the VA intake. The efficacy of this combined approach of supplementation and fortification for increasing maternal VA status during lactation is not known. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of postpartum high dose VA supplementation and provision of VA fortified oil for household consumption on plasma and milk retinol concentrations of lactating Moroccan women during the first 6 months after giving birth. Postpartum women aged 19-40 years received a VA supplement and thereafter were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive weekly vitamin A fortified oil (FO) or non-fortified oil (NFO) for 6 months. Serum retinol concentration was higher in the FO group than in the NFO group at 6 months after giving birth (p < 0.0001). Milk retinol per gram fat at baseline did not differ by group; by 3 months after giving birth, milk retinol per gram fat was higher in the FO group than in the NFO group (p = 0.02) and remained higher throughout the 6 months (p < 0.0001). The combination of supplementation and fortification has a more sustained impact on milk retinol concentrations than supplementation alone, which did not have a sustained impact on milk VA concentrations. The fortification approach seems to be more effective for maintaining adequate milk VA concentrations among lactating Moroccan women. Fortification seems to be a long-term solution for the problem of VA deficiency, especially among women in low-income communities."
2011,22004951,Potential pharmacological applications of polyphenolic derivatives from marine brown algae.,"Recently, the isolation and characterization of the biologically active components from seaweeds have gained much attention from various research groups across the world.

Among marine algae, brown algal species such as Ecklonia cava, Eisenia arborea, Ecklonia stolinifera and Eisenia bicyclis have been studied for their potential biological activities. Majority of the investigations on phlorotannins derived from brown algae have exhibited their potentiality as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitumor, antihypertensive, anti-allergic, hyaluronidase enzyme inhibition and in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibition activity. In this review, we have made an attempt to discuss the potential biological activities of phlorotannins from marine brown algae and their possible candidature in the pharmaceutical applications."
2011,20809272,"Plasma zinc, copper, and serum thyroid hormones and insulin levels after zinc supplementation followed by placebo in competitive athletes.","Intense physical activity is associated with biological adaptations involving hormones and trace elements. Zinc supplementation may affect plasma copper concentration, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid hormones, insulin, and glucose homeostasis, but data in athletes are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate in competitive athletes (cyclists, n = 7, 32 ± 8 years) the effect of zinc supplementation (22 mg/day as zinc gluconate) during 30 days, and discontinuation using placebo (maltodextrin) during the following 30 days, on plasma zinc and copper concentrations, serum thyroid hormones, insulin and glucose levels, and HOMA2-IR. Compared to baseline, plasma zinc and Zn:Cu plasma ratio increased, but plasma copper decreased after zinc supplementation (day 30) and discontinuation (day 60) (p < 0.05). Zn supplementation and discontinuation had no effect on TSH, T3, and T4. Fasting serum insulin and HOMA2-IR increased (27% and 47%, respectively) on day 60 compared to baseline (p = 0.03), suggesting a delayed effect of zinc supplementation. Moreover, plasma zinc was positively associated with serum insulin (r = 0.87, p = 0.009) and HOMA2-IR (r = 0.81, p = 0.03) after zinc supplementation (day 30), indicating that supplemental zinc may impair glucose utilization in cyclists."
1993,8214465,Zingiber officinale (ginger)--an antiemetic for day case surgery.,"The effect of powdered ginger root was compared with metoclopramide and placebo. In a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was measured in 120 women presenting for elective laparoscopic gynaecological surgery on a day stay basis. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar in patients given metoclopramide and ginger (27% and 21%) and less than in those who received placebo (41%). The requirement for postoperative antiemetics was lower in those patients receiving ginger. The requirements for postoperative analgesia, recovery time and time until discharge were the same in all groups. There was no difference in the incidence of possible side effects such as sedation, abnormal movement, itch and visual disturbance between the three groups. Zingiber officinale is an effective and promising prophylactic antiemetic, which may be especially useful for day case surgery."
2018,28669218,Protective effect of Nigella sativa oil against acetamiprid induced reproductive toxicity in male rats.,"The present study was designed to investigate the adverse reproductive effects of acetamiprid, besides the possible protective role of Nigella sativa oil (NSO), as a potential antioxidant agent. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were allocated into four equal groups of eight, control (CRL), acetamiprid (ACMP, 27 mg/kg), Nigella sativa oil (NSO, 0.5 ml/kg) and in combination (ACMP + NSO). The experimental animals were dosed by gavage (5 days per week) for 45 consecutive days. Body weight gain, reproductive organs weights, sperm characteristics, testosterone, and thiobarbutiric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels were investigated. The obtained results showed that ACMP decreased significantly (p < 0.001) the body weight gain and the absolute weights of reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, and seminal vesicles). Furthermore, significant alterations at least (p < 0.01) in semen characteristics were noted in ACMP group as evidenced by a decline in spermatids number, sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone level with an increase in abnormal and dead sperm and TBARS level. Treatment with NSO alone may stimulate spermatogenesis, increased significantly (p < 0.001) spermatids number and the weight of seminal vesicles. On the other hand, the co-administration of NSO along with ACMP can mitigate more efficiently and modulate in certain cases the adverse effects induced by ACMP on reproductive organs weights, semen quality, testosterone, and TBARS levels (at least p < 0.001). This obvious protective role of NSO against ACMP induced reproductive toxicity may be due to its antioxidant properties and ability to reduce TBARS levels as shown in this work."
2008,18697605,Mechanism of vasorelaxant activity of a fraction of root extract of Sesamum indicum Linn.,"The petroleum ether soluble fraction (SIPE) of the root extract of S. indicum was evaluated for the vasorelaxant activity using isolated rat aorta. SIPE up to 180 microg/ml concentration significantly inhibited phenylephrine- and KCl-induced contraction to the extent of 98.13 +/- 6.37 and 70.19 +/- 3.43% respectively in isolated rat aorta in a concentration dependent manner. The vasorelaxant activity was not blocked by propranolol (10 microM), atropine (1 microM) indomethacin (10 microM) and glibenclamide (10 microM). Influence of SIPE on phenylephrine-induced contractions in aortic preparations in absence of functional endothelium and on pre-incubating the tissue with L-NAME (300 microM) or methylene blue (10 microM) was also studied. SIPE at 180 microg/ml concentration could elicit partial relaxation in presence of L-NAME or methylene blue to the extent of 34.26 +/- 6.13 and 25.66 +/- 10.95% respectively. However, in absence of functional endothelium, SIPE exhibited little relaxation to the extent of 6.70 +/- 4.87%. These studies revealed that the vasorelaxant activity of SIPE was chiefly mediated through endothelium-dependent pathway."
2004,15112866,Effect of the new H1-antagonist ReN1869 on capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in human skin/Human phase-I trial using somatosensory evoked potentials induced by a CO2 laser.,"Extensive pre-clinical investigations have shown that the tricyclic compound ReN1869 ((R)-1-(3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-1-propyl)-3-piperidine carboxylic acid, CAS 170149-99-2) is a potent H1-antagonist with pronounced antinociceptive properties. In this human phase-I trial the effect of different acute and multiple doses of ReN1869 on capsaicin induced neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia was investigated. Twenty-one healthy male subjects were enrolled in this randomised, double-blind, three-period, crossover trial design--consisting of acute and one week b.i.d. oral administration of 25 and 50 mg doses of ReN1869 and matching placebo--separated by 3 week washout periods. Capsaicin solution (1%) (INCI: Capsicum frutescens--containing capsaicinoides from Capsicum annuum annuum, CAS 84603-55-4) was applied in an occlusive mode for 30 min on the skin of the back in all three acute and subchronic medication periods to induce neurogenic inflammation. When the nociceptive laser pulses were applied to the capsaicin pre-treated skin, ReN1869 exerted a highly significant reduction of the pain response--as predominantly detected by suppression of the (central) P2-component in the laser-induced somatosensory evoked potentials (LSEPs) from Vertex-EEG. The primary efficacy endpoint, the N1/P2 peak to peak amplitude, was significantly reduced with the administration of ReN1869--primarily by a suppression of the P2-component of the LSEP. This suppression was dose-dependent and was more pronounced after a one week treatment (subchronic mode) with ReN1869 than after the first dose (acute mode). In contrast to the (central) P2-component there was no significant effect on the (peripheral) N1-component of the LSEPs taken from capsaicin-treated skin. As ReN1869 had no significant effect when the laser pulses were applied to normal skin, and the compound's effect was mainly restricted to the (central) P2-component, when LSEPs were taken from capsaicin treated skin, it can be concluded that ReN1869 exerts its positive effect to reduce capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia by a primarily central mechanism."
2002,12162852,"7-OH-flavone is sulfated in the human liver and duodenum, whereas 5-OH-flavone and 3-OH-flavone are potent inhibitors of SULT1A1 activity and 7-OH-flavone sulfation rate.","1. The aim of this investigation was to see whether 7-OH-flavone, 5-OH-flavone and 3-OH-flavone, which are present in edible vegetables, fruit and wine, are substrates or inhibitors of human liver and duodenum sulfotransferase. 2. An assay was set up to study the sulfation of 7-OH-flavone, and using this assay, it was observed that 7-OH-flavone was sulfated and the rate of sulfation (mean +/- SD) was 324 +/- 87 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (liver) and 584 +/- 164 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (duodenum; p < 0.0001). 3. 7-OH-flavone sulfotransferase followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the K(m) (mean +/- SD) was 0.2 +/- 0.04 microM (liver) and 1.1 +/- 0.3 microM (duodenum; p = 0.008).

The IC50 of 5-OH-flavone for SULT1A1 was 0.3 +/- 0.06 microM (liver) and 0.3 +/- 0.1 microM (duodenum; n.s.) and those of 3-OH-flavone were 1.0 +/- 0.1 microM (liver) and 1.6 +/- 0.03 microM (duodenum; p = 0.0006). 6. There was inhibition of 7-OH-flavone sulfation rate by 5-OH-flavone and 3-OH-flavone. The IC(50) of 5-OH-flavone for the sulfation rate of 7-OH-flavone was 3.5 +/- 0.5 microM (liver) and 69 +/- 18 microM (duodenum; p < 0.0001) and for 3-OH-flavone it was 18 +/- 3.4 microM (liver) and 213 +/- 47 microM (duodenum; p < 0.0001). 7. The position of the hydroxy group confers to the molecules of OH-flavones the quality of substrate or inhibitor of sulfotransferase."
2008,18633211,[Survey of pesticide residues in imported cereal products (1994.4 approximately 2006.3)].,"A survey of pesticide residues in 490 imported cereal products on the Tokyo market from April 1994 to March 2006 was carried out. Eight kinds of organophosphorus pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, DDVP, diazinon, etrimfos, malathion, MEP and pirimiphos-methyl) were detected at levels between Tr (below 0.01 ppm) and 0.82 ppm from 91 samples. In our investigations, chlorpyrifos-methyl and malathion tended to be detected in samples from America, pirimiphos-methyl in those from Europe, and MEP in those from Oceania. Thus, pesticide residues seemed to be different in produce from different areas. Residue levels of these pesticides were calculated as between 0.08 and 13.2% of their ADI values according to the daily intake of cereal products. Therefore, these cereal products should be safe for normal usage."
1993,8343227,Abnormalities in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid release in the pathogenesis of hypertension.,"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) respond to angiotensin and norepinephrine with an exaggerated pressor response. We have investigated the possibility that increased vascular reactivity in SHR may be related to a reduced synthesis of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) resulting from a defect in the release of its precursor, dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid (DGLA). Isolated perfused mesenteric vascular beds of SHR and age matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were perfused with Kreb's bicarbonate buffer. The effluent was collected and the fatty acid composition determined by gas chromatography. In SHR the release of DGLA, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and virtually all other fatty acids detected in the effluent were reduced when compared to their normotensive controls. This difference could not be explained by low tissue fatty acid levels because these were higher in SHR. Evening primrose oil (EPO) when added to the diet increased the release of DGLA but not of other prostanoid precursors. EPO also reduced vascular reactivity and reduced blood pressure in SHR. It is suggested that the defect in the release of DGLA may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension because it occurs early before hypertension has actually occurred."
,24784510,The effect of sodium hypochlorite and ginger extract on microorganisms and endotoxins in endodontic treatment of infected root canals.,"This in vitro study sought to evaluate the biomechanical preparation action on microorganisms and endotoxins by using sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and an intracanal medication containing Zingiber officinale, with or without calcium hydroxide. Single-rooted teeth were contaminated, and root canal instrumentation (using 2.5% NaOCl) was performed. Samples were divided into 4 groups, according to the intracanal medication employed. The root canal content was gathered 28 days after contamination (baseline), immediately after biomechanical preparation, 7 days after biomechanical preparation, 14 days after intracanal medication, and 7 days after intracanal medication was removed. The results (submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests) showed that the NaOCl eliminated 100% of root canal microorganisms and reduced 88.8% of endotoxins immediately after biomechanical preparation, and 83.2% at 7 days after biomechanical preparation."
2012,22681911,Angiostatic role of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor etoricoxib (MK0663) in experimental lung cancer.,"Lung cancer was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intra-tracheal instillation of 9,10-dimethybenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and evaluated the anti-angiogenic action of etoricoxib, which is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. The animals were divided into four groups. Group 1 (Control) received 0.9% (w/v) normal saline intra-tracheal and 0.5% (w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose per oral daily as the vehicle of the drug, Group 2 received DMBA (20 mg/kg) intra-tracheal once, Group 3 received a daily oral dose of etoricoxib (0.6 mg/kg bw) in addition to the DMBA while Group 4 received etoricoxib alone. Morphological and histological analysis confirmed the presence of lung tumors 20 weeks after the administration of DMBA. Expressions of COX-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, MCP-1, MIP-1β and VEGF were studied by immunofluorescence, Western immunoblot and mRNA studies, which showed a higher expression of these proteins in the DMBA-treated animals but much lower in DMBA+etoricoxib. Gelatin zymography as applied for the detection of the extracellular protein degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases showed more intense activity in DMBA-treated rats as compared to the other groups. Also, the isolated alveolar macrophages were stained with Merocyanine540 (MC540) to study the membrane fluidity and lipid packing effect. DMBA treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number of lung cells exhibiting a high intensity of MC540 staining, which was reduced by the co-administration of etoricoxib. Thus the effects of etoricoxib on the expression of the angiogenic proteins have been observed, which clearly shows an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action of etoricoxib in lung cancer chemoprevention."
2016,26960161,Effects of nucleus accumbens oxytocin and its antagonist on social approach behavior.,"Severe impairment of social interaction is a core symptom of numerous psychiatric disorders. Oxytocin (OT) has been shown to be involved in various aspects of social behavior related to reproduction, but little is known about its effects on nonreproductive social interaction between adults or the neuroanatomical location where OT exerts its action. Here, we examined the nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain containing high levels of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) and comprising an important node in the neural circuitry possibly related to social interaction. Behavioral effects of a local microinfusion of OT (0.1, 1, and 10 ng/side) and an oxytocin receptor antagonist (OTR-A) (1, 10, and 100 ng/side) were evaluated in naturally high social and low social female and male monogamous mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus) using the social preference paradigm and open-field tests. The results showed that administration of 1 ng/side OT increased social preference; however, this effect was not apparent at lower or higher doses. OT did not alter anxiety-like behavior or total locomotion. Microinfusions of a selective OTR-A at 10 and 100 ng doses reduced social approach behavior; a dose of 1 ng had no effect. In conclusion, our results suggest that accumbal OT and OTR-A regulate social preferences in voles in a dose-dependent manner."
2014,24245828,In vitro genoprotective and genotoxic effect of nicotine on human leukocytes evaluated by the comet assay.,"The comet assay was used to measure the DNA damage induced in vitro by nicotine in human leukocytes as the extent of DNA migration in the comet head area, tail length, percent DNA in the tail, and Olive tail moment. Samples of whole blood were collected and blood cells were challenged with acute doses of 0.1, 1 and 10 µM of (-)-nicotine for 60 minutes. We found that nicotine treatment had dose-dependent effects on the level of DNA damage. At 1 and 10 µM of nicotine, both Olive tail moment and percent DNA in the tail significantly increased (p < 0.001), compared to the control. In the presence of 10 µM of nicotine, the shortest tail length and the smallest head area were detected. At a concentration of 0.1 µM, surprisingly, DNA damage detected by the comet assay was lower than in the control, which was proved by the observed significantly (p < 0.001) lower Olive tail moment and percent DNA in the tail as well as larger head area. The results suggest that nicotine, at a reasonably low concentration (0.1 µM), comparable to those found in the blood of habitual smokers, may have a protective effect, whereas higher doses of nicotine (1 and 10 µM) are genotoxic. The possible participation of reactive oxygen species in the DNA-damaging potential of nicotine is discussed."
2016,26304317,Gelatin hydrolysates from farmed Giant catfish skin using alkaline proteases and its antioxidative function of simulated gastro-intestinal digestion.,"This work aims to evaluate the ability of different alkaline proteases to prepare active gelatin hydrolysates. Fish skin gelatin was hydrolysed by visceral alkaline-proteases from Giant catfish, commercial trypsin, and Izyme AL®. All antioxidant activity indices of the hydrolysates increased with increasing degree of hydrolysis (P<0.05). The hydrolysates obtained with Izyme AL® and visceral alkaline-proteases showed the highest and lowest radical scavenging capacity, while prepared with commercial trypsin was the most effective in reducing ferric ions and showed the best metal chelating properties. The hydrolysate obtained with Izyme AL® showed the lowest iron reducing ability, but provided the highest average molecular weight (⩾ 7 kDa), followed by commercial trypsin (2.2 kDa) and visceral alkaline-proteases (1.75 kDa). After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, the hydrolysates showed significant higher radical scavenging, reducing ferric ions and chelating activities. Gelatin hydrolysates, from fish skin, could serve as a potential source of functional food ingredients for health promotion."
2012,22095865,Hepatic retinoid levels in seven fish species (teleosts) from a tropical coastal lagoon receiving effluents from iron-ore mining and processing.,"The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible effects of Fe and trace element exposure on hepatic levels of retinoids in seven fish species. Concentrations of retinoids were measured in fish collected from a coastal lagoon in Brazil that receives effluents from an iron-ore mining and processing plant. Fish from nearby coastal lagoons were also included to assess possible differences related to chemical exposure. Results indicated considerable differences in hepatic retinoid composition among the various species investigated. The most striking differences were in retinol and derivative-specific profiles and in didehydro retinol and derivative-specific profiles. The Perciformes species Geophagus brasiliensis, Tilapia rendalli, Mugil liza, and Cichla ocellaris and the Characiforme Hoplias malabaricus were characterized as retinol and derivative-specific, while the Siluriformes species Hoplosternum littorale and Rhamdia quelen were didehydro retinol and derivative-specific fish species. A negative association was observed between Al, Pb, As, and Cd and hepatic didehydro retinoid levels. Fish with higher levels of hepatic Fe, Cu, and Zn showed unexpectedly significant positive correlations with increased hepatic retinol levels. This finding, associated with the positive relationships between retinol and retinyl palmitate with lipid peroxidation, may suggest that vitamin A is mobilized from other tissues to increase hepatic antioxidant levels for protection against oxidative damage. These data show significant but dissimilar associations between trace element exposure and hepatic retinoid levels in fish species exposed to iron-ore mining and processing effluents, without apparent major impacts on fish health and condition."
,8073694,[Effect of fruit and vegetable juices on the changes in the production of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in human gastric juice].,"The study was made of the effect of apple, grapefruit, orange and beet juices on in vitro formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) from sodium nitrite and amidopirin in human gastric juice (GJ). Experimental samples of GJ from outpatients attending the outpatient department of the AMS Cancer Research Center were used. The patients had various forms of gastritis and gastric cancer. It was found that fruit and beet juices may inhibit or enhance NDMA formation depending on the GJ composition, pH in particular. In acid medium (pH-1.3-3.4) there was a trend to inhibition of NDMA synthesis, while in neutral and alkaline (pH = 7.4-8.5) medium NDMA synthesis is activated. Practical implications of the findings are discussed."
2016,26878656,Efficacy of cisplatin-based immunochemotherapy plus alloSCT in high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia: final results of a prospective multicenter phase 2 HOVON study.,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) remains the only curative option for CLL patients. Whereas active disease at the time of alloSCT predicts poor outcome, no standard remission-induction regimen exists. We prospectively assessed outcome after cisplatin-containing immune-chemotherapy (R-DHAP) followed by alloSCT in 46 patients (median age 58 years) fulfilling modified European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) CLL Transplant Consensus criteria being refractory to or relapsed (R/R) <1 year after fludarabine or <2 years after fludarabine-based immunochemotherapy or R/R with del(17p). Twenty-nine patients received ⩾3 cycles of R-DHAP and sixteen <3 cycles (4 because of disease progression, 8 for toxicity and 4 toxic deaths). Overall rate of response to R-DHAP was 58%, 31 (67%) proceeded to alloSCT after conditioning with fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI. Twenty (65%) remained free from progression at 2 years after alloSCT, including 17 without minimal residual disease. Intention-to-treat 2-year PFS and overall survival of the 46 patients were 42 and 51% (35.5 months median follow-up); del(17p) or fludarabine refractoriness had no impact. R-DHAP followed by alloSCT is a reasonable treatment to be considered for high-risk CLL patients without access or resistance to targeted therapies. "
2019,30724248,Extension of postharvest shelf-life in green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) using exogenous application of polyamines (spermidine and putrescine).,"To extend the postharvest shelf-life of green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), an exogenous application of two polyamines, Spermidine and Putrescine (SPD-PUT), was tested in multiple combinations (10 μM plus 10 μM, 20 μM plus 20 μM, and 30 μM plus 30 μM) at 4 ± 1 °C for 40 days. The titratable acidity, protein content, activities of catalase and peroxidase, chlorophyll and capsaicin content gradually decreased for all the treated and untreated fruits throughout the storage period. On the other hand, proline content and antioxidant 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity continuously increased with the extension of time-span under storage. Among the three treatment combinations, the combination of 20 µM SPD and 20 µM PUT was found to be the optimum, based on the response of all the morphological and physicochemical traits assessed. The same combination was effective in sustaining the quality of green bell pepper following its harvest, for a period of at least 40 days."
2014,25196630,Methionine deficiency does not increase polyamine turnover through depletion of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine in juvenile Atlantic salmon.,"During the last few decades, plant protein ingredients such as soya proteins have replaced fishmeal in the diets of aquacultured species. This may affect the requirement and metabolism of methionine as soya contains less methionine compared with fishmeal. To assess whether methionine limitation affects decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine availability and polyamine status, in the present study, juvenile Atlantic salmon were fed a methionine-deficient plant protein-based diet or the same diet supplemented with dl-methionine for 8 weeks. The test diets were compared with a fishmeal-based control diet to assess their effects on the growth performance of fish. Methionine limitation reduced growth and protein accretion, but when fish were fed the dl-methionine-supplemented diet their growth and protein accretion equalled those of fish fed the fishmeal-based control diet. Methionine limitation reduced free methionine concentrations in the plasma and muscle, while those in the liver were not affected. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentrations were higher in the liver of fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, while S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations were not affected. Putrescine concentrations were higher and spermine concentrations were lower in the liver of fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, while the gene expression of SAM decarboxylase (SAMdc) and the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was not affected. Polyamine turnover, as assessed by spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase (SSAT) abundance, activity and gene expression, was not affected by treatment. However, the gene expression of the cytokine TNF-α increased in fish fed the methionine-deficient diet, indicative of stressful conditions in the liver. Even though taurine concentrations in the liver were not affected by treatment, methionine and taurine concentrations in muscle decreased due to methionine deficiency. Concomitantly, liver phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations were reduced, while NEFA concentrations were elevated. In conclusion, methionine deficiency did not increase polyamine turnover through depletion of hepatic SAM, as assessed by SSAT activity and abundance. "
2010,20154101,Antidiabetic effect of some medicinal plants of Oriental Morocco in neonatal non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus rats.,"The goal of the present study is to test the effect of water extract (WE) of four medicinal plants used as antidiabetics in Eastern Morocco (Arbutus unedo: Au, Ammoïdes pusilla: Ap, Thymelaea hirsuta: Th, and Urtica dioïca: Ud). These plants are used in cooking to bring out the flavor in a dish or to complement it. The first experiment was realized in order to determine the antidiabetic effect of the WE of these plants during 5 weeks' treatment. Seven groups of Wistar rats were used: Healthy controls, neonatal streptozotocin (n-stz) induced-diabetic rats (90 mg/kg; intraperitoneally [i.p.]), n-stz + tolbutamide (400 mg/l), and 4 groups n-stz + WE of plants (400 mg/l, drink water). The percentages of Plasma glucose lowering effect were, respectively for Au, Ap, Th, Ud and tolbutamide: 31.6 % p<0.01, 27.4 % p<0.05, 38.2 % p<0.01, 13 % and 33.9 % p<0.05 when compared with untreated diabetic controls. In a second experiment, oral glucose tolerance tests were carried out in n-stz induced-diabetic rats. The i.p. administration of the water extract (WE) of Ap and Ud (150 mg/kg) 30 minutes before the glucose overload (2 g/kg) showed a significant reduction glycemia, respectively of 36 % at 60 min (p<0.05) and 50 % at 180 min (p<0.05) after glucose overload compared with controls. In contrast, the effect of WE of Au and Th (150 mg/kg, i.p.) was not significant. The in vitro study of glucose utilization by isolated rat hemidiaphragm suggests that these extracts in combination with insulin potentiate its activity and enhance the utilization of glucose. In conclusion, it seems that these plants possess antidiabetic activity."
2016,27618992,Stability of total phenolic concentration and antioxidant capacity of extracts from pomegranate co-products subjected to in vitro digestion.,"Co-products obtained from pomegranate juice processing contain high levels of polyphenols with potential high added values. From value-addition viewpoint, the aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of polyphenolic concentrations in pomegranate fruit co-products in different solvent extracts and assess the effect on the total antioxidant capacity using the FRAP, DPPH˙ and ABTS(+) assays during simulated in vitro digestion.Pomegranate juice, marc and peel were extracted in water, 50 % ethanol (50%EtOH) and absolute ethanol (100%EtOH) and analysed for total phenolic concentration (TPC), total flavonoids concentration (TFC) and total antioxidant capacity in DPPH˙, ABTS(+) and FRAP assays before and after in vitro digestion.Total phenolic concentration (TPC) and total flavonoid concentration (TFC) were in the order of peel > marc > juice throughout the in vitro digestion irrespective of the extraction solvents used. However, 50 % ethanol extracted 1.1 to 12-fold more polyphenols than water and ethanol solvents depending on co-products. TPC and TFC increased significantly in gastric digests. In contrast, after the duodenal phase of in vitro digestion, polyphenolic concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to those obtained in gastric digests. Undigested samples and gastric digests showed strong and positive relationships between polyphenols and the antioxidant activities measured in DPPH, ABTS(+) and FRAP assays, with correlation coefficients (r (2)) ranging between 0.930-0.990. In addition, the relationships between polyphenols (TPC and TFC) and radical cation scavenging activity in ABTS(+) were moderately positive in duodenal digests.Findings from this study showed that concentration of pomegranate polyphenols and the antioxidant capacity during in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion may not reflect the pre-digested phenolic concentration. Thus, this study highlights the need to provide biologically relevant information on antioxidants by providing data reflecting their stability and activity after in vitro digestion."

2018,29502829,Structural consequences of the interaction of puroindolines with gluten proteins.,"The effect of puroindolines (PINs) on structural characteristics of wheat proteins was investigated in Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (cv. Svevo) and Triticum aestivum (cv. Alpowa) and in their respective derivatives in which PIN genes were expressed (Soft Svevo) or the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5D was deleted and PINs were not expressed (Hard Alpowa). The presence of PINs decreased the amount of cold-SDS extractable proteins and the accessibility of protein thiols to specific reagents, but resulted in facilitated solvation of gluten proteins, as detected by tryptophan fluorescence measurements carried out on minimally mixed flour/water mixtures. We propose that PINs and gluten proteins are interacting in the grain or flour prior to mixing. Hydrophobic interactions between PINs and some of the gluten proteins modify the pattern of interactions among gluten proteins, thus providing an additional mechanistic rationale for the effects of PINs on kernel hardness."
2019,31129703,Mechanistic perspective of protective effects of resveratrol against cisplatin-induced ovarian injury in rats: emphasis on anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.,"Chemotherapeutic platinum-containing drugs are widely used to treat a variety of cancer types; however, they cause ovarian failure and infertility. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the potential protective effect of resveratrol against cisplatin-induced ovarian damage in a rat model. Female rats were given either cisplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p., once per week for two consecutive weeks) and/or resveratrol (10 mg/kg, orally for 17 days). Follicular development, ovarian function markers, as well as apoptotic and inflammatory markers were assessed 24 h after the last resveratrol dose. Resveratrol ameliorated the marked follicular loss and the significant reduction in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level triggered by cisplatin. Mechanistically, cisplatin elicited a potent inflammatory response in ovarian tissue as evidenced by the elevated expression of tumor necrosis factor, nuclear factor kappa-B, and proinflammatory enzymes. Co-treatment with resveratrol inhibited the elevation in inflammatory mediators induced by cisplatin. Further, cisplatin switched on the apoptotic machinery in ovarian tissues via increasing the expression of both cytochrome c and caspase-3 which was reversed upon resveratrol co-treatment. Resveratrol also counteracts the upregulating poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase expression which could attribute to the inflammatory and apoptotic effects of cisplatin. Resveratrol protects the ovary from cisplatin-induced toxicity through preventing the loss of the AMH-secreting granulosa cells, diminishing PARP-1 expression, and downregulating the inflammatory and apoptotic events implicated in cisplatin toxicity."
2018,29554965,"Fucoxanthin, the constituent of Laminaria japonica, triggers AMPK-mediated cytoprotection and autophagy in hepatocytes under oxidative stress.","Laminaria japonica has frequently been used as a food supplement and drug in traditional oriental medicine. Among the major active constituents responsible for the bioactivities of L. japonica, fucoxanthin (FX) has been considered as a potential antioxidant. This study was conducted to examine the effects of L. japonica extract (LJE) or FX against oxidative stress on hepatocytes and to elucidate the overall their cellular mechanisms of the effects.We constructed an in vitro model with the treatment of arachidonic acid (AA) + iron in HepG2 cells to stimulate the oxidative damage. The cells were pre-treated with LJE or FX for 1 h, and incubated with AA + iron. The effect on oxidative damage and cellular mechanisms of LJE or FX were assessed by cytological examination and several biochemical assays under conditions with or without kinase inhibitiors.LJE or FX pretreatment effectively blocked the pathological changes caused by AA + iron treatment, such as cell death, altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as procaspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and mitochondria dysfunction. Moreover, FX induced AMPK activation and AMPK inhibitor, compound C, partially reduced the protective effect of FX on mitochondria dysfunction. Consistent with AMPK activation, FX increased the protein levels of autophagic markers (LC3II and beclin-1) and the number of acridine orange stained cells, and decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and simultaneously increased the phosphorylation of ULK1. And the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methylanine or bafilomycin A1 partially inhibited the protective effect of FX on mitochondria dysfunction.These findings suggest that FX have the function of being a hepatic protectant against oxidative damages through the AMPK pathway for the control of autophagy."
2012,22222335,Inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation by furostanol saponins isolated from the bulbs of Allium macrostemon Bunge.,"Three new furostanol saponins (FSs) were recently isolated from the dried bulbs of Allium macrostemon and were shown to have antiplatelet effects. This study investigated the inhibitory capabilities of these compounds on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced human platelet activation. FS-1, when compared with the other 2, had a potent inhibitory effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and on the expression of P-selectin and integrin β-3. FS-1 also inhibited Ca mobilization and significantly decreased phosphorylated AKT expression in ADP-activated platelets. The suppression by FS-1 of ADP-induced platelet activation and aggregation shown in this study indicate its potential for therapeutic applications."
2017,28494312,Anagyrine desensitization of peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. A potential biomarker of quinolizidine alkaloid teratogenesis in cattle.,"Anagyrine, a teratogenic quinolizidine alkaloid found in Lupinus spp., is proposed to undergo metabolism by pregnant cattle to a piperidine alkaloid which inhibits fetal movement, the putative mechanism behind crooked calf syndrome. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that anagyrine but not lupanine or sparteine can directly, without metabolism, desensitize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in a cell culture model. SH-SY5Y cells expressing autonomic nAChR, and TE-671 cells expressing fetal muscle-type nAChR were exposed to lupine alkaloids or Dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) in log10 molar increments from 10nM to 100μM and then to a fixed concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) (10μM for SH-SY5Y cells and 1μM for TE-671 cells) and the responses measured with a membrane potential sensing dye to assess nAChR activation and desensitization. The selective ganglionic nAChR agonist DMPP used as a positive control, was a potent activator and desensitizer of nAChR expressed by SH-SY5Y cells. Lupanine was a weak agonist and desensitizer in SH-SY5Y cells and sparteine was without effect. Anagyrine acted as a partial agonist in both cell lines with EC50 values of 4.2 and 231μM in SH-SY5Y and TE-671 cells, respectively. Anagyrine was a desensitizer of nAChR with DC50 values of 6.9 and 139μM in SH-SY5Y and TE-671 cells, respectively. These results confirm the hypothesis that anagyrine is a potent and effective desensitizer of nAChR, and that anagyrine can directly, without metabolism, desensitize nAChR. Moreover, serum anagyrine concentrations may be a potential biomarker for lupine teratogenicity in cattle."
2008,18086515,"Soybean saponin inhibits tumor cell metastasis by modulating expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP- 2.","The antimetastatic properties of soybean saponin were investigated by evaluating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) production in HT-1080 cells. The mRNA expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by RT-PCR analysis. The levels of secreted MMP-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) were determined by gelatin zymography and/or ELISA. The invasion of a Matrigel-coated membrane by human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 and HT-29 colon cancer cells was quantitatively assessed by counting the migrated cells. The treatment of HT-1080 cells with soybean saponin inhibited the mRNA expression of and reduced the amounts of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas it increased the amount of secreted TIMP-2 dose-dependently. Soybean saponin significantly inhibited the invasion of HT-1080 cells through a Matrigel-coated membrane. The antimetastatic properties by soybean saponin were further confirmed by in vivo mice experiment via the tail vein injection of CT-26 colon cancer cells after feeding the mice the dietary soybean saponin. The incidence of metastatic tumor colonization of lungs of mice moderately decreased 2 weeks after the tail vein injection of CT-26 cells. Our current data support the notion that soybean saponin inhibits tumor cell metastasis by suppressing MMP-2 and MMP-9 productions, and stimulating TIMP-2 secretion, thereby suggesting that soybean saponin has a chemopreventive property against cancer metastasis."
2018,29754011,Prolonged exposure of dietary phytoestrogens on semen characteristics and reproductive performance of rabbit bucks.,"The effects of inclusion of different sources of dietary phytoestrogens on antioxidant capacity, hormonal balance, libido, semen quality, and fertility of rabbit bucks were studied. Twenty-one, adult, fertile, V-line bucks were randomly allocated into 3 homogenous groups (n = 7/treatment) and received control diet (phytoestrogens-free diet, CON) or soybean meal isoflavones-containing diet (SMI) or linseed meal lignans-containing diet (LML) for 12 wk. The diets were formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The concentrations of isoflavones in the SMI diet were 24.04 mg/100 g dry matter (DM) daidzein and 13.10 mg/100 g DM genistein. The major phytoestrogen detected in the LML diet was secoisolariciresinol (36.80 mg/100 g DM). Treatment had no effects on body weight, feed intake and rectal temperature of bucks. Compared with control, bucks fed the SMI and LML diets had higher (P < 0.001) blood plasma total antioxidant capacity (0.98 ± 0.12, 1.50 ± 0.13, and 2.29 ± 0.17 mM/L for CON, SMI, and LML, respectively), and lower (P < 0.01) blood plasma malondialdehyde (2.76 ± 0.23, 1.76 ± 0.16, and 1.70 ± 0.18 nmol/mL for CON, SMI, and LML, respectively), whereas activities of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes were not affected. Bucks fed the SMI and LML diets had greater (P < 0.001) concentrations of blood plasma triiodothyronine. Feeding the SMI and LML diets decreased (P < 0.01) libido (8.26 ± 0.71, 12.18 ± 0.97, and 14.12 ± 1.12 s for CON, SMI, and LML, respectively), sperm concentration (327.7 ± 21.6, 265.8 ± 36.8, and 226.5 ± 20.1 × 106/mL for CON, SMI, and LML, respectively), testosterone (5.16 ± 0.95, 3.91 ± 0.63, and 3.04 ± 0.92 ng/mL for CON, SMI, and LML, respectively), and seminal plasma fructose compared with the CON diet. The percentage of progressive motile sperm was improved (P < 0.001) by both phytoestrogen-containing diets. Feeding the SMI diet increased (P = 0.02) the percentage of live sperm compared with CON, whereas LML resulted in an intermediate value. Dietary treatment of bucks did not affect kindling rates or litter sizes of does, and did not affect birth weights or viabilities of kits. In conclusion, prolonged consumption of dietary isoflavones or lignans did not impair semen fertilizability. This may be due to the benefits of antioxidant activity or due to the benefits of other components in the diet. Dietary phytoestrogens did evoke obvious decreases in libido and steroidogenesis with altered semen parameters."
2014,25006699,Low-level seaweed supplementation improves iodine status in iodine-insufficient women.,"Iodine insufficiency is now a prominent issue in the UK and other European countries due to low intakes of dairy products and seafood (especially where iodine fortification is not in place). In the present study, we tested a commercially available encapsulated edible seaweed (Napiers Hebridean Seagreens® Ascophyllum nodosum species) for its acceptability to consumers and iodine bioavailability and investigated the impact of a 2-week daily seaweed supplementation on iodine concentrations and thyroid function. Healthy non-pregnant women of childbearing age, self-reporting low dairy product and seafood consumption, with no history of thyroid or gastrointestinal disease were recruited. Seaweed iodine (712 μg, in 1 g seaweed) was modestly bioavailable at 33 (interquartile range (IQR) 28-46) % of the ingested iodine dose compared with 59 (IQR 46-74) % of iodine from the KI supplement (n 22). After supplement ingestion (2 weeks, 0·5 g seaweed daily, n 42), urinary iodine excretion increased from 78 (IQR 39-114) to 140 (IQR 103-195) μg/l (P< 0·001). The concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone increased from 1·5 (IQR 1·2-2·2) to 2·1 (IQR 1·3-2·9) mIU/l (P< 0·001), with two participants having concentrations exceeding the normal range after supplement ingestion (but normal free thyroxine concentrations). There was no change in the concentrations of other thyroid hormones after supplement ingestion. The seaweed was palatable and acceptable to consumers as a whole food or as a food ingredient and effective as a source of iodine in an iodine-insufficient population. In conclusion, seaweed inclusion in staple foods would serve as an alternative to fortification of salt or other foods with KI."
2017,27542469,Chemical consequences of three commercial strains of Oenococcus oeni co-inoculated with Torulaspora delbrueckii in durian wine fermentation.,"This work evaluated for the first time the chemical consequences of three commercial strains of Oenococcus oeni co-inoculated with Torulaspora delbrueckii in durian wine fermentation. Compared with the control (yeast only, 5.70% v/v ethanol produced), samples co-inoculated with T. delbrueckii and O. oeni PN4 improved ethanol production (6.06% v/v), which was significantly higher than samples co-inoculated with Viniflora (4.78% v/v) or Enoferm Beta (5.01% v/v). Wines co-fermented with the respective latter two oenococci contained excessive levels of ethyl acetate (>80mg/L) that were likely to affect negatively wine aroma. In addition, they led to significantly higher acetic and lactic acid production relative to PN4. O. oeni PN4 seemed to be the most suitable strain to co-inoculate with T. delbrueckii for simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic fermentation in durian wine by contributing moderately increased concentrations of higher alcohols, acetate esters and ethyl esters that would have positive sensory impacts.

2015,24724962,Solid lipid micro-dispersions (SLMs) based on PEGylated solidified reverse micellar solutions (SRMS): a novel carrier system for gentamicin.,"The purpose of this study was to formulate and evaluate novel PEGylated solidified reverse micellar solutions (SRMS)-based solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) for improved delivery of gentamicin. Lipid matrix (SRMS) [consisting of 15% w/w Phospholipon® 90G (P90G) in 35% w/w dika wax (Irvingia gabonensis) was formulated and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). SLMs were formulated by melt-emulsification using the SRMS, PEG 4000 and gentamicin (1.0, 2.0, 3.0% w/w), and their physicochemical as well as pharmacokinetic parameters determined. In vitro permeation of gentamicin from the SLMs through artificial membrane (0.22 μm pore size) was carried out using Franz's cell and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) as acceptor medium, while bioevaluation was performed using clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Stable and irregularly-shaped gentamicin-loaded SLMs of size range 34.49 ± 2.56 to 53.52 ± 3.09 µm were obtained. The SLMs showed sustained drug permeation and exhibited time-dependent and capacity-limited bioactivity. Overall, SLMs containing 2% w/w SRMS, 3% w/w gentamicin and PEG 4000 entrapped the highest amount of drug, gave highest IZD against the test organisms and highest permeation flux (5.239 μg/cm(2).min) and permeation coefficient (1.781 × 10(-6)cm/min) within 420 min, while pure gentamicin gave the least. Preliminary in vivo pharmacokinetic studies also showed an AUC-24 of 1507 µg/h/ml for the optimized formulation, while that of oral drug solution was 678 µg/h/ml. This showed a 2.2-fold increase in the systemic bioavailability of gentamicin from the optimized formulation. PEGylated SRMS-based SLMs prepared with heterolipid from Irvingia gabonensis would likely offer a reliable delivery system for gentamicin."
2004,15219940,Artesunate reduces chicken chorioallantoic membrane neovascularisation and exhibits antiangiogenic and apoptotic activity on human microvascular dermal endothelial cell.,"Artesunate (ART), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin extracted from the Chinese herb Artemisia annua, is a safe and effective antimalarial drug. ART has now been analyzed for its anti-angiogenic activity in vivo and in vitro. The anti-angiogenic effect in vivo was evaluated on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) neovascularisation model. ART started to significantly inhibit CAM angiogenesis at a low concentration of 10 nm/100 microl/egg, and completely inhibited the angiogenesis at 80 nm/100 microl/egg. The inhibitory effect of in vitro angiogenesis was tested on the models of proliferation and differentiation of human microvascular dermal endothelial cell line, an important representive of endothelial cells, as well as immunocytochemistry assay for two major VEGF receptors (Flt-1 and KDR/flk-1) expressions. The results showed that ART could remarkably inhibit proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent form in a range of 12.5-100 microM. ART also could reduce Flt-1 and KDR/flk-1 expressions in a range of 0.1-0.5 microM. Furthermore, we examined the apoptosis of human microvascular dermal endothelial cell line induced by ART. The apoptosis was detected by morphological assay of ethidium bromide (EB)/acridine orange (AO) dual staining as well as DNA fragmentation assay of TUNEL labeling and quantified by flowcytometric PI assay. Our results suggest that the antiangiogenic effect induced by ART might occur by the induction of cellular apoptosis. These findings and the known low toxicity indicated ART might be a promising candidate for angiogenesis inhibitors."
2016,26726947,Phase I study of temozolomide in combination with thiotepa and carboplatin with autologous hematopoietic cell rescue in patients with malignant brain tumors with minimal residual disease.,"Recurrence of malignant brain tumors results in a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell rescue (AHCR) has been used in patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors and has shown improved outcomes compared with standard chemotherapy. Temozolomide is standard therapy for glioblastoma and has also shown activity in patients with medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor (PNET), particularly those with recurrent disease. Temozolomide was administered twice daily on days -10 to -6, followed by thiotepa 300 mg/m(2) per day and carboplatin dosed using the Calvert formula or body surface area on days -5 to -3, with AHCR day 0. Twenty-seven patients aged 3-46 years were enrolled. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (n=12); medulloblastoma/PNET (n=9); central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumor (n=4); ependymoma (n=1) and spinal cord PNET (n=1). Temozolomide doses ranged from 100 mg/m(2) per day to 400 mg/m(2) per day. There were no toxic deaths. Prolonged survival was noted in several patients including those with recurrent high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma and CNS germ cell tumor. Increased doses of temozolomide are feasible with AHCR. A phase II study using temozolomide, carboplatin and thiotepa with AHCR for children with recurrent malignant brain tumors is being conducted through the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium."
2018,29793179,"Nano strategies for berberine delivery, a natural alkaloid of Berberis.","Berberine, as a phytochemical component of some medicinal Chinese herbs (most frequently Berberis vulgaris), is an isoquinoline alkaloid with many therapeutic effects including anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-diarrhea, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. Berberine has some significant effects on type 2 diabetes through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, glycolysis stimulation, and mitochondrial function inhibition which subsequently improves both lipid and glucose metabolism. Some other effects of berberine on congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension have been reported. Beside the beneficial effects of berberine, some limitations including poor aqueous solubility, slight absorption, and low bioavailability have hindered its applications. To overcome these limitations, nanotechnology has been considered as main strategy. This review describes different types of nanocarriers (polymeric based, magnetic mesoporous silica based, lipid based, dendrimer based, graphene based, silver and gold nanoparticles) have been used for encapsulation of berberine."
2009,19734654,White sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) bran extracts suppressed IgE production by U266 cells.,"Sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world. In this study, we identified the IgE production-suppressing activity of white sorghum bran extracts. White sorghum is one of the genotypes of sorghum. White sorghum bran extracts in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) suppressed IgE production in human myeloma cell line U266. The extracts suppressed IgE production by decreasing mRNA transcription level of IgE, but they did not affect IgA or IgG production of mice splenocytes in vitro. Heat treatment and trypsin digestion did not affect IgE production-suppressing activity. The white sorghum bran extracts were fractionated by ultrafiltration, and the molecular weight of the active substance was estimated to be less than 1,000."
2013,23790842,Solvent optimization extraction of antioxidants from foxtail millet species' insoluble fibers and their free radical scavenging properties.,"In this study, water and 80% of four organic solvents were employed to optimize the extraction of antioxidants from two species of foxtail millet's insoluble fibers under the same temperature, time, and solid/solvent ratio. The results showed that the acetone was able to extract the maximum amount of antioxidants (2.32 mg/g fiber for white specie and 3.86 mg/g fiber for yellow specie) followed by methanol and propanol from both samples. The neutral and the ethanol on the other hand extracted small amount of the antioxidants from the two fiber materials. While considerable level of Total Polyphenols Content (TPC) was recorded in both the water and the organic solvents' extracts, only traces of Total Flavonoid content (TFC) were observed in water, methanol and ethanol extracts. Propanol and acetone extracts was negative to the TFC test. The potency of both white and yellow foxtail millets' insoluble fibers antioxidant extracts was investigated using five different in vitro tests. It was realized that there was a variation in their capacities to quench DPPH and ABTS(+) radicals for the time running of 0-60 min. The samples from the yellow cereal exhibited high inhibition capacity against ABTS(+). No correlation was observed between TPC and radical scavenging capacities for DPPH and ABTS(+). In general, the yellow species contained more antioxidants in comparison with the white one and this accounted for its high antioxidant activity."
2017,28881290,Glycyrrhizic acid increases glucagon like peptide-1 secretion via TGR5 activation in type 1-like diabetic rats.,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is belonged to triterpenoid saponin that is contained in the root of licorice and is known to affect metabolic regulation. Recently, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has widely been applied in diabetes therapeutics. However, the role of GLP-1 in GA-induced anti-diabetic effects is still unknown. Therefore, we are interested in understanding the association of GLP-1 with GA-induced effects. In type 1-like diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ-treated rats), GA increased the level of plasma GLP-1, which was blocked by triamterene at a dose sufficient to inhibit Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). The direct effect of GA on TGR5 has been identified using the cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) transfected TGR5 gene. Moreover, in intestinal NCI-H716 cells that secreted GLP-1, GA promoted GLP-1 secretion with a marked elevation of calcium levels. However, both effects of GA were reduced by ablation of TGR5 with siRNA in NCI-H716 cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that GA can enhance GLP-1 secretion through TGR5 activation."
2011,21351824,Nanoparticle-based immunopotentiation via tetanus toxoid-loaded gelatin and aminated gelatin nanoparticles.,"Gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) and aminated gelatin nanoparticles (AGNPs) were prepared and used as an adjuvant to improve the delivery of tetanus toxoid (TT). Nanoparticles were characterized in vitro for their size, shape, entrapment, and release. TT-FITC conjugate was used to determine entrapment and release from nanoparticles. The immune-stimulating activity was studied by measuring anti-TT IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a isotype and cytokine responses following subcutaneous (s.c) injection of nanoparticles in BALB/c mice and was compared with alum-TT vaccine. Gelatin and aminated gelatin (AG) specific IgG response was also determined. Both GNPs and AGNPs demonstrated comparable IgG response and a significantly higher (p < 0.05) cytokine response (IL-2 and IFN γ) as compared to alum-TT vaccine. Nanoparticulate formulations elicited both Th1 and Th2 responses and induced negligible undesirable immunogenicity against the carrier, as demonstrated by lower level of gelatin and AG-specific IgG response as compared to control."
2010,20590627,"Sublethal concentrations of the platinum(II) complex [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] alter the motility and induce anoikis in MCF-7 cells.","We showed previously that a new Pt(II) complex ([Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)]) exerted high and fast apoptotic processes in MCF-7 cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] is also able to exert anoikis and alter the migration ability of MCF-7 cells, and to show some of the signalling events leading to these alterations.Cells were treated with sublethal doses of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)], and the efficiency of colony initiation and anchorage-independent growth was assayed; cell migration was examined by in vitro culture wounding assay. Gelatin zymography for MMP-2 and -9 activities, Western blottings of MMPs, MAPKs, Src, PKC-epsilon and FAK, after [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] treatment, were also performed.Sub-cytotoxic drug concentrations decreased the: (i) anchorage-dependent and -independent growth; (ii) migration ability; and (iii) expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the activation of p38MAPK, Src and PKC-epsilon. p38MAPK phosphorylation, cell anoikis and migration due to [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] were blocked by PKC-epsilon inhibition. Furthermore, Src inhibition blocked the [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)]-provoked activation of PKC-epsilon, while ROS generation blockage inhibited the activation of Src, and also the decrement of phosphorylated FAK observed in detached [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)]-treated cells.Sublethal concentrations of [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] induced anoikis and prevented events leading to metastasis via alterations in cell migration, anchorage independency, stromal interactions and MMP activity. Hence, [Pt(O,O'-acac)(gamma-acac)(DMS)] may be a promising therapeutic agent for preventing growth and metastasis of breast cancer."
2005,15884133,Gastric mucosal injury due to hemorrhagic reperfusion and efficacy of Salvia miltiorrhizae extract F and cimetidine.,"To observe the gastric mucosal injury caused by hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion and to compare the effect between Salvia miltiorrhizae extract F (SEF) and cimetidine (CI) on it.A model of hemorrhage/reperfusion injury was produced by Itoh method. Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: 0.9% sodium chloride treatment group (NS group), SEF treatment group (SEF group), and CI treatment group (CI group). Saline, SEF and CI were injected respectively. The index of gastric mucosal lesions (IGML) was expressed as the percentage of lesion area in the gastric mucosa. The degree of gastric mucosal lesions was categorized into grades 0, 1, 2, 3. Atom absorption method was used to measure the intracellular calcium content. Radioimmunoassay was used to measure the concentrations of prostaglandins.IGML (%) and grade 3 (%) were 23.18+/-6.82, 58.44+/-9.07 in NS group, 4.42+/-1.39, 20.32+/-6.95 in SEF group and 3.74+/-1.56, 23.12+/-5.09 in CI group, and the above parameters in SEF group and CI group decreased significantly (IGML: SEF vs NS, t = 6.712, P = 0.000<0.01; CI vs NS, t = 6.943, P = 0.000<0.01; grade 3: SEF vs NS, t = 8.386, P = 0.000; CI vs NS, t = 8.411, P = 0.000), but the grade 0 and grade 1 damage in SEF group (22.05+/-5.96, 34.12+/-8.12) and CI group (18.54+/-4.82, 30.15+/-7.12) were markedly higher than those in NS group (3.01+/-1.01, 8.35+/-1.95; grade 0: SEF vs NS, t = 8.434, P = 0.000<0.01; CI vs NS, t = 7.950, P = 0.000<0.01; grade 1: SEF vs NS, t = 8.422, P = 0.000<0.01; CI vs NS, t = 8.448, P = 0.000<0.01). The intracellular calcium content (microg/mg) in SEF group (0.104+/-0.015) and CI group (0.102+/-0.010) was markedly lower than that in NS group (0.131+/-0.019, SEF vs NS, t = 2.463, P = 0.038<0.05; CI vs NS, t = 3.056, P = 0.017<0.05). The levels (pg/mg) of PGE(2), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)/TXB(2) were 540+/-183, 714+/-124, 17.38+/-5.93 in NS group and 581+/-168, 737+/-102, 19.04+/-8.03 in CI group, 760+/-192, 1 248+/-158, 33.42+/-9.24 in SEF group, and the above parameters in SEF group markedly raised (PGE(2): SEF vs NS, t = 2.282, P = 0.046<0.05; SEF vs CI, t = 2.265, P = 0.047<0.05; 6-keto-PGF(1alpha): SEF vs NS, t = 6.583, P = 0.000<0.000; SEF vs CI, t = 6.708, P = 0.000<0.01; 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)/TXB(2): SEF vs NS, t = 3.963, P = 0.003<0.001; SEF vs CI, t = 3.243, P = 0.009<0.01), whereas TXB(2) level in SEF group (45.37+/-7.54) was obviously lower than that in NS group (58.28+/-6.74, t = 3.086, P = 0.014<0.05) and CI group (54.32+/-6.89, t = 2.265, P = 0.047<0.05). No significant difference was shown between NS group and CI group (PGE(2): t = 0.414, P = 0.688>0.05; 6-keto-PGF(1alpha): t = 0.310, P = 0.763>0.05; TXB(2): t = 1.099, P = 0.298>0.05; 6-keto-PGF(1alpha)/TXB(2): t = 0.372, P = 0.718>0.05).Both SEF and CI could inhibit reperfusion-induced injury in gastric mucosa, but with different mechanisms. SEF could not only enhance the protective effect of gastric mucosa, but also abate the injury factors, while CI can only abate the injury factors."
2016,27608429,Oral administration of an aqueous extract from the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus enhances the immunonutritional recovery of malnourished mice.,"Mushroom nutriceutical components have lately attracted interest for developing immunonutritional support. However, there is relatively little information pertaining to the use of mushroom preparations for modulating the metabolic and immunological disorders associated to malnutrition. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of oral administration of an aqueous extract (CW-P) from Pleurotus ostreatus on the recovery of biochemical and immunological functions of malnourished mice. 8-week old female BALB/c mice were starved for 3days and then refed with commercial diet supplemented with or without CW-P (100mg/kg) for 8days. Regardless of the diet used during refeeding, animal body weights and serum protein concentrations did not differ between groups. Oral treatment with CW-P normalized haemoglobin levels, liver arginase and gut mucosal weight. CW-P increased total liver proteins and also DNA and protein contents in gut mucosa. Pleurotus extract provided benefits in terms of macrophages activation as well as in haemopoiesis, as judged by the recovery of bone marrow cells and leukocyte counts. Moreover, CW-P stimulated humoral immunity (T-dependent and T non-dependent antibodies responses) compared to non-supplemented mice. CW-P extract from the oyster mushroom can be used to develop specific food or nutritional supplement formulations with potential clinical applications in the immunotherapy."
2016,27173572,"Hydrogen sulfide production during yeast fermentation causes the accumulation of ethanethiol, S-ethyl thioacetate and diethyl disulfide.","Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced by yeast during winemaking and possesses off-flavors reminiscent of rotten eggs. The production of H2S during fermentation has also been associated in the finished wine with the rise of additional volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) with strong aromas of cooked onions and vegetables. To characterize these more complex VSCs produced from H2S, we performed fermentations in synthetic grape juice. H2S production was manipulated experimentally by feeding increasing concentrations of sulfate to mutant strains that are unable to incorporate H2S efficiently as part of the sulfur assimilation pathway. In finished wines from these mutants, three VSCs - ethanethiol, S-ethyl thioacetate and diethyl disulfide - increased proportionally to H2S. (34)S-labeled sulfate fed to the MET17-deleted strain was incorporated into same three VSCs, demonstrating that they are formed directly from H2S. "
2006,16819173,"Effect of SA1, a herbal formulation, on sexual behavior and penile erection.","SA1 is a mixture of 9 Oriental herbs (Korean red ginseng, fermented soybean, Tribulus terrestris, Fructus Rubi, Fructus Lycii, Semen Cuscutae, Dioscorea Rhizome, Fructus Corni and Fructus Crataegi) that are widely used as energizers and vitalizers in the indigenous system of medicine and have been alleged to improve the sexual functions in men. This study evaluated SA1 using both in vitro and in vivo experiments on laboratory animals in order to determine its effect on the sexual behavior and penile erection. The male rats used to examine the copulatory behavior were administered either the vehicle or SA1 (30, 100, 300, 600 mg/kg) orally for 2 weeks. The intracavernous pressure and systemic blood pressure were recorded in anesthetized rats. The responses to acetylcholine and SA1 of rabbit corpus cavernosum strips were also examined. There was an overall increase in the copulatory behavior parameters in the SA1-treated rats, which was reflected by a decrease in the mount and intromission latencies and an increase in the ejaculation latency and mount frequency. SA1 significantly increased the ratio of the intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure. In vitro, SA1 significantly enhanced the relaxation responses to acetylcholine. These results suggest that SA1 improves the sexual activity and erectile function."
2007,17164350,"Resveratrol inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and overcomes chemoresistance through down-regulation of STAT3 and nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic and cell survival gene products in human multiple myeloma cells.","Whether resveratrol, a component of red grapes, berries, and peanuts, could suppress the proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells by interfering with NF-kappaB and STAT3 pathways, was investigated. Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of human multiple myeloma cell lines regardless of whether they were sensitive or resistant to the conventional chemotherapy agents. This stilbene also potentiated the apoptotic effects of bortezomib and thalidomide. Resveratrol induced apoptosis as indicated by accumulation of sub-G(1) population, increase in Bax release, and activation of caspase-3. This correlated with down-regulation of various proliferative and antiapoptotic gene products, including cyclin D1, cIAP-2, XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1, and TRAF2. In addition, resveratrol down-regulated the constitutive activation of AKT. These effects of resveratrol are mediated through suppression of constitutively active NF-kappaB through inhibition of IkappaBalpha kinase and the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and of p65. Resveratrol inhibited both the constitutive and the interleukin 6-induced activation of STAT3. When we examined CD138(+) plasma cells from patients with MM, resveratrol inhibited constitutive activation of both NF-kappaB and STAT3, leading to down-regulation of cell proliferation and potentiation of apoptosis induced by bortezomib and thalidomide. These mechanistic findings suggest that resveratrol may have a potential in the treatment of multiple myeloma."
2008,18365688,Beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors from Perilla frutescens var. acuta.,"In the course of screening for anti-dementia agents from natural products, two beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors were isolated from the methanolic extract of Perilla frutescens var. acuta and identified as luteolin (1) and rosmarinic acid (2) with IC50 values of 5.0 x 10(-7) M and 2.1 x 10(-5) M, respectively. They inhibited BACE1 in a non-competitive manner with a substrate in Dixon plots, suggesting that they might bind to either beta-secretase subsite or to another regulatory site. Kivalues of 1 and 2 were 6.2 x 10(-5) M and 3.9 x 10(-5) M, respectively. They were less inhibitory against other enzymes such as alpha-secretase (TACE), acetylcholine esterase (AchE), chymotrypsin, and elastase, indicating that they were relatively specific inhibitors of BACE1."
2016,26988521,"Preparation of antioxidative corn protein hydrolysates, purification and evaluation of three novel corn antioxidant peptides.","Corn gluten meal is a major co-product of corn wet milling. Corn gluten meal was hydrolyzed with Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Alcalase+Flavourzyme and Flavourzyme+Alcalase. At the substrate concentration of 10%, corn protein hydrolysate catalyzed by Alcalase had a degree of hydrolysis of 17.83%, which was higher than that by Flavourzyme (3.65%). The hydrolysate catalyzed by Alcalase+Flavourzyme exhibited better antioxidant activities and was further purified. Three novel antioxidant peptides were purified by a series of chromatographic techniques. Sequences of the three peptides were identified as Cys-Ser-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala, Tyr-Pro-Lys-Leu-Ala-Pro-Asn-Glu and Tyr-Pro-Gln-Leu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Glu, respectively. Among the three peptides, Cys-Ser-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala exhibited good reducing power and excellent scavenging capacities for DPPH radical and superoxide anion radical, with IC50 values of 0.116 and 0.39mg/ml, respectively. The results from our study indicate antioxidant potency of corn protein hydrolysates and peptides separated from corn gluten meal and can provide basic understanding for the application of corn protein hydrolysates as natural antioxidants."
2015,25794715,Optimization of conditions for the single step IMAC purification of miraculin from Synsepalum dulcificum.,"In this study, the methods for extraction and purification of miraculin from Synsepalum dulcificum were investigated. For extraction, the effect of different extraction buffers (phosphate buffer saline, Tris-HCl and NaCl) on the extraction efficiency of total protein was evaluated. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) with nickel-NTA was used for the purification of the extracted protein, where the influence of binding buffer pH, crude extract pH and imidazole concentration in elution buffer upon the purification performance was explored. The total amount of protein extracted from miracle fruit was found to be 4 times higher using 0.5M NaCl as compared to Tris-HCl and phosphate buffer saline. On the other hand, the use of Tris-HCl as binding buffer gave higher purification performance than sodium phosphate and citrate-phosphate buffers in IMAC system. The optimum purification condition of miraculin using IMAC was achieved with crude extract at pH 7, Tris-HCl binding buffer at pH 7 and the use of 300 mM imidazole as elution buffer, which gave the overall yield of 80.3% and purity of 97.5%. IMAC with nickel-NTA was successfully used as a single step process for the purification of miraculin from crude extract of S. dulcificum."
2014,24093429,Microemulsion for simultaneous transdermal delivery of benzocaine and indomethacin: in vitro and in vivo evaluation.,"This study investigated simultaneous transdermal delivery of indomethacin and benzocaine from microemulsion. Eucalyptus oil based microemulsion was used with Tween 80 and ethanol being employed as surfactant and cosurfactant, respectively. A microemulsion formulation comprising eucalyptus oil, polyoxyethylene sorbitan momooleate (Tween 80), ethanol and water (20:30:30:20) was selected. Indomethacin (1% w/w) and benzocaine (20% w/w) were incorporated separately or combined into this formulation before in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Application of indomethacin microemulsion enhanced the transdermal flux and reduced the lag time compared to saturated aqueous control. The same trend was evident for benzocaine microemulsion. Simultaneous application of the two drugs in microemulsion provided similar enhancement pattern. The in vivo evaluation employed the pinprick method and revealed rapid anesthesia after application of benzocaine microemulsion with the onset being 10 min and the action lasting for 50 min. For indomethacin microemulsion, the analgesic effect was recorded after 34.5 min and lasted for 70.5 min. Simultaneous application of benzocaine and indomethacin provided synergistic effect. The onset of action was achieved after 10 min and lasted for 95 min. The study highlighted the potential of microemulsion formulation in simultaneous transdermal delivery of two drugs."
2000,10996298,Curcumin-glutathione interactions and the role of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1.,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a yellow pigment of turmeric with antioxidant properties has been shown to be a cancer preventative in animal studies. It contains two electrophilic alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups, which can react with nucleophilic compounds such as glutathione (GSH), but formation of the GSH-curcumin conjugates has not previously been demonstrated. In the present studies, we investigated the reactions of curcumin with GSH and the effect of recombinant human glutathione S-transferase(GST)P1-1 on reaction kinetics. Glutathionylated products of curcumin identified by FAB-MS and MALDI-MS included mono- and di-glutathionyl-adducts of curcumin as well as cyclic rearrangement products of GSH adducts of feruloylmethylketone (FMK) and feruloylaldehyde (FAL). The presence of GSTP1-1 significantly accelerated the initial rate of GSH-mediated consumption of curcumin in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM GSH. GSTP1-1 kinetics determined using HPLC indicated substrate inhibition (apparent K(m) for curcumin of 25+/-11 microM, and apparent K(i) for curcumin of 8+/-3 microM). GSTP1-1 was also shown to catalyze the reverse reaction leading to the formation of curcumin from GSH adducts of FMK and FAL."
2009,19422396,"Beneficial effects of danshensu, an active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, on homocysteine metabolism via the trans-sulphuration pathway in rats.","Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level has been established as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Danshensu, an active ingredient of Salvia miltiorrhiza, shows wide cardiovascular benefit. However, in terms of its own methylation, danshensu could elevate tHcy level, which would act against its cardiovascular benefit, thus posing a 'therapeutic paradox'. As this paradox has not been fully assessed, we have evaluated the effects of danshensu on tHcy levels to uncover the underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENT APPROACH: We evaluated the influence of danshensu on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism in rats with normal tHcy levels and in rat models of elevated tHcy (single intravenous methionine loading model and a hyperhomocysteinemic model after 3 weeks methionine dosing, with and without 3 weeks of danshensu treatment). We also quantified some metabolic intermediates (S-adenosyl methionine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione) relevant to Hcy metabolism in rat liver and kidney.Acute treatment with a single dose of danshensu in rats with normal tHcy did not change plasma tHcy. In contrast, danshensu significantly lowered tHcy in rats with elevated tHcy. The relatively higher cysteine and glutathione levels after treatment with danshensu indicated that its tHcy-lowering effect was via increased activity of the trans-sulphuration pathway.Our results suggested that danshensu may act both acutely to increase trans-sulphuration and after chronic exposure to up-regulate the activity of the trans-sulphuration enzymes. The tHcy-lowering effect of danshensu is another cardiovascular benefit provided by S. miltiorrhiza and suggests a potential tHcy-lowering therapy."
2015,25766833,Tea and soybean extracts in combination with milk fermentation inhibit growth and enterocyte adherence of selected foodborne pathogens.,"This study examined the antibacterial and anti-adhesive properties of pure plant extracts (PPEs) of green tea (GT), black tea (BT) and soybean individually or in combination with milk. Fermented phenolic enriched-milk (fPEM) was prepared by combining PPEs with milk and fermented with lactic acid bacteria. Antimicrobial activity of extracts was evaluated by broth-dilution and agar diffusion assay. Anti-adhesive property of extracts was evaluated in Caco-2 cell model. Results from antibacterial tests showed that PPEs exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Tea extracts were more effective in inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria while soybean extract exhibited similar effects against all pathogens tested. For fPEM, although total phenolic contents decreased compared with those in PPEs, growth inhibitory effect of fPEM containing tea extracts was greatly enhanced. All extracts showed significant inhibition against pathogen adhesion to Caco-2 cells. In particular, adhesion inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes was >89% when fPEM extracts were applied. "
2006,16819192,Turmeric and curcumin modulate the conjugation of 1-naphthol in Caco-2 cells.,"Turmeric, the powdered dry rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant, and curcumin, the major anti-oxidant constituent of turmeric, have been shown to possess chemopreventive activity. To elucidate the possible interaction of turmeric and curcumin with conjugation reactions, which in many cases are involved in the activation of procarcinogens, we measured their effects in the conjugation of 1-naphthol in Caco-2 cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line, within a 24 h period. Turmeric exhibits inhibitory activity toward both sulfo- and glucuronosyl conjugations of 1-naphthol at approximately the same levels (IC(50)=0.24 and 0.29 mg/ml, respectively). Curcumin inhibits sulfo-conjugation at lower concentrations (IC(50)=9.7 microg/ml), but only showed weak inhibition toward glucuronosyl conjugation of 1-naphthol in Caco-2 cells. In addition, turmeric was found to strongly inhibit in vitro phenol sulfotransferase (SULT) activity and demonstrate moderate inhibitory properties against UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) activity in Caco-2 cells (IC(50)=0.17 mg/ml and 0.62 mg/ml, respectively). Curcumin also strongly inhibits in vitro phenol sulfotransferase activity with an IC(50) of 2.4 microg/ml. Moreover, and in contrast to the moderate inhibition of UGT activity by turmeric and curcumin, both induce the expression of the UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 genes, revealed by real-time PCR analysis. These findings are indicative of a possible interaction of both turmeric and curcumin with conjugation reactions in the human intestinal tract and colon. This in turn may affect the bioavailability of therapeutic drugs and toxicity levels of environmental chemicals, particularly procarcinogens."
2014,24842559,Novel anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia that can potentially result in stroke. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) like warfarin were for many decades the only oral anticoagulants available for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at high risk of stroke. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOACS) have been introduced that act via direct inhibition of thrombin (dabigatran) or activated factor X (edoxaban, rivaroxaban and apixaban). Unlike VKAs, these anticoagulants do not require routine INR monitoring and posses favorable pharmacological properties. NOACs act rapidly, and have a stable and predictable dose-related anticoagulant effect with few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. Phase III trials comparing these agents to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF demonstrated that they are at least as efficacious and safe as warfarin. Evolution of clinical guidelines to incorporate the new anticoagulants for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF may result in a reduction in the incidence of AF-related strokes. Safe and effective use of these new drugs in clinical practice requires understanding of their distinct pharmacological properties. "
1995,7486843,Response of the calf pancreas to differently processed soya bean and pea diets.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of replacing skim-milk powder by differently treated soya bean or pea products on growth, pancreas size and pancreatic enzyme activities in calves. Three separate experiments have been performed. In experiments 1 and 2, 28 and 21 male Holstein calves were divided into 4 or 3 groups, respectively, and fed either dairy products or milk substitutes in which protein was mainly provided by soya bean products differing in their protein concentration due to the technological processing applied. In experiment 3, 45 male Holstein calves were divided into 3 groups and were fed either dairy products, or raw or flaked pea flour as a protein source. After an experimental period of 99 +/- 4 days in experiments 1 and 2, and of 88 days in experiment 3, animal growth rate was significantly lower with raw pea flour (16%) and with the soya bean diet, which was highly concentrated in carbohydrates and allergenic proteins (13-27%). Pancreas weight decreased significantly (16-18%) with pea diets and tended to be lower (NS) with the water extracted, concentrated and heated flour (soya bean). Amylase-specific activity increased significantly (43%) with pea diets but showed opposite tendencies with the most refined soya bean products. Proteolytic enzyme activities were slightly influenced by dietary protein source, but this was not as obvious as in the literature reviewed. Specific messenger RNAs corresponding to amylase, trypsin and chymotrypsin seemed to increase (NS) with the soya bean diets, particularly with the less elaborated one. However, further investigations are required before any conclusions may be drawn concerning regulation levels of pancreatic adaptation to dietary protein. According to this study and the literature, results concerning pancreatic response to diets were different suggesting that the origin of soya bean, pea seeds and technological treatments applied to them were of great importance. Also, the level of incorporation into milk substitute and the presence of more or less antinutritional factors could influence pancreatic enzyme variations by complex mechanisms."
2019,30744848,"In-situ modification of castor oil with divalent metal ions like Zn (II), Cu (II), Co (II) and Ba (II) and their comparative antioxidant study by in-vitro methods.","US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted for direct addition of castor oil into food for human consumption and recently FDA approved castor oil as over-the-counter (OTC) for laxative drug. Castor oil (COL) is a vegetable oil and naturally polyol which is inexpensive, environmental friendly and a very valuable renewable resource. Metals are believed to influence antioxidant property of ligands. Metals copper, zinc, cobalt and barium were incorporated with castor oil and subsequently structures were established by FT-IR, UV-Visible, and 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques. In vitro antioxidant activities of metal containing COL were determined by DPPH and superoxide scavenging methods and the results were compared with vitamin C. Enhanced antioxidant nature of metal containing castor oil was noticed and compared to virgin castor oil. This study reveals that synthesized metal containing-COL is a potential antioxidant material."
1982,7064768,Exercise assessment of sinoatrial node function following the Mustard operation.,"To screen for sinoatrial node dysfunction following the Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries, we studied the chronotropic response to graded maximal treadmill exercise in 29 patients at mean 6.7 years after operation. Although 93% of patients had normal resting heart rate (HR), 83% demonstrated significant depression of maximum HR and/or recovery HR after termination of exercise. These findings were similarly present among a subset of 13 patients with normal exercise tolerance. Resting and exercise-induced HR in 10 patients receiving chronic digoxin therapy were no different than in the 19 patients without medication. Sixteen patients with abnormal chronotropic responses to exercise had intracardiac electrophysiologic evaluation which confirmed sinoatrial node dysfunction in nine. Abnormal HR responses did not correlate with clinical symptoms, cardiac arrhythmias, or postoperative hemodynamics. Maximal exercise testing may be a sensitive noninvasive method to identify sinoatrial node dysfunction in postoperative children."
1998,9752668,[Functional properties of alginates and their use in therapeutic-prophylactic nutrition].,"Adsorbability of alginic acid and its salts extracted from brown seaweeds and character of their biological action were studied. The results of clinical tests alginic acid and its salts as well as of preparations and food-stuffs, prepared from Laminaria japonica Arech, were reflected. The potentialities of use of alginates and food-stuffs containing them in therapeutic nutrition was shown."
2012,22527094,Human pericyte-endothelial cell interactions in co-culture models mimicking the diabetic retinal microvascular environment.,"Pericytes regulate vascular tone, perfusion pressure and endothelial cell (EC) proliferation in capillaries. Thiamine and benfotiamine counteract high glucose-induced damage in vascular cells. We standardized two human retinal pericyte (HRP)/EC co-culture models to mimic the diabetic retinal microvascular environment. We aimed at evaluating the interactions between co-cultured HRP and EC in terms of proliferation/apoptosis and the possible protective role of thiamine and benfotiamine against high glucose-induced damage. EC and HRP were co-cultured in physiological glucose and stable or intermittent high glucose, with or without thiamine/benfotiamine. No-contact model: EC were plated on a porous membrane suspended into the medium and HRP on the bottom of the same well. Cell-to-cell contact model: EC and HRP were plated on the opposite sides of the same membrane. Proliferation (cell counts and DNA synthesis), apoptosis and tubule formation in Matrigel were assessed. In the no-contact model, stable high glucose reduced proliferation of co-cultured EC/HRP and EC alone and increased co-cultured EC/HRP apoptosis. In the contact model, both stable and intermittent high glucose reduced co-cultured EC/HRP proliferation and increased apoptosis. Stable high glucose had no effects on HRP in separate cultures. Both EC and HRP proliferated better when co-cultured. Thiamine and benfotiamine reversed high glucose-induced damage in all cases. HRP are sensitive to soluble factors released by EC when cultured in high glucose conditions, as suggested by conditioned media assays. In the Matrigel models, addition of thiamine and benfotiamine re-established the high glucose-damaged interactions between EC/HRP and stabilized microtubules."
1987,2949603,Effect of alpha interferon on the altered T-B-cell immunoregulation in patients with thalassemia major.,"We studied the ability of B-lymphocytes to differentiate to immunoglobulin-producing cells in 14 patients with thalassemia major, 11 parents of the patients, and 86 normal subjects. In comparison with the parents of the patients and with the normal individuals, the patients were found to have 1) an increased number of cells spontaneously secreting immunoglobulin; 2) a decreased number of plaque-forming cells (PFC) when induced with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and a deficient helper T-cell function for the induction of B-cell differentiation; 3) an increase in the number of PFC after the addition of alpha interferon (100 IU/ml) to the cell cultures with PWM. Previous incubation of non-T-cells with alpha interferon for 1 hr and subsequent coculture with T-cells from the same patients or from normal subjects in the presence of PWM increased the number of PFC. On the contrary, previous incubation of T-cells with alpha interferon followed by coculture with normal non-T-cells or cells from the same patient did not modify the number of PFC. These results suggest that patients with thalassemia major possess hyperreactive spontaneous B-cell responses and that these B-cells are unable to differentiate to immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the presence of PWM. This would be due to a T-helper-cell deficiency with an inability to produce lymphokines (interferon being one of them), while the B-cell function seems to remain intrinsically intact."
2005,15922308,The licorice root derived isoflavan glabridin increases the function of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.,"Glabridin, an isoflavan purified from licorice root, exhibits diverse biological activities, including estrogen-like activity. To investigate the bioactivities of glabridin, which act on bone metabolism, the effects of glabridin on the function of mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) and the production of local factors in osteoblasts were studied. Glabridin (1-10microM) significantly increased the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells and caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen content and osteocalcin secretion in the cells (P<0.05). The effect of glabridin (10microM) in increasing ALP activity and collagen content was completely prevented by the presence of 10(-6)M cycloheximide and 10(-6)M tamoxifen, suggesting that glabridin's effect results from a newly synthesized protein component and might be partly involved in estrogen action. Then, the effects of glabridin on the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) in osteoblasts were examined. Treatment with glabridin (1-10microM) prevented apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha (10(-10)M) in osteoblastic cells. Moreover, glabridin (50microM) decreased the 10(-10)M TNF-alpha-induced production of PGE2 and NO in osteoblasts. Our data indicate that the enhancement of osteoblast function by glabridin may result in the prevention for osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases."
2005,15997111,Soybean oil in total parenteral nutrition maintains albumin and antioxidant enzyme mRNA levels.,"Changes in albumin and antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression in infant rat liver following administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with/without soybean oil emulsion were studied. Infant rats were divided into three groups: group 1=oral diet, group 2=TPN without fat, and group 3=TPN with 20% of calories from soybean oil emulsion. The period of TPN administration was 4 d. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in group 2 than in the other groups, with similar levels seen in the other groups. Albumin, Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, and glutaredoxin 1 mRNA expression levels were lower in group 2 than in the other groups, with similar levels seen in the other groups. Catalase mRNA expression was higher in group 1 than in the other groups, with the lowest level seen in group 2. Soybean oil emulsion should be included in TPN regimens to prevent down-regulation of albumin and antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression."
2008,18981574,Anti-inflammatory activity of pectolinarigenin and pectolinarin isolated from Cirsium chanroenicum.,"In order to identify the active anti-inflammatory ingredient(s) in Cirsium chanroenicum (Compositae), its methanol extract and several solvent fractions were prepared; the methanol extract and the ethylacetate fraction inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-mediated leukotriene (LT) production in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 cells and A23187-treated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells, respectively. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethylacetate fraction using column chromatography led to the isolation of pectolinarigenin (5,7-dihydroxy-4',6-dimethoxyflavone), along with pectolinarin [pectolinarigenin 7-rhamnosyl-(1-->6)-glucoside]. Pectolinarigenin strongly inhibited COX-2-mediated PGE2 and 5-LOX-mediated LT production at >1 microM, indicating that it is a dual inhibitor of COX-2/5-LOX. However, pectolinarigenin did not affect COX-2 expression or nuclear transcription factor (NF-kappaB) activation. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that oral administration of these two compounds at 20-100 mg/kg resulted in similar inhibitory activities against several animal models of inflammation/allergy: arachidonic acid-induced mouse ear edema, carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. All of these results suggest that pectolinarigenin and pectolinarin possess anti-inflammatory activity and that they may inhibit eicosanoid formation in inflammatory lesions. These activities certainly contribute to the anti-inflammatory mechanism of C. chanroenicum."
1990,2293761,Use of DDAVP in inherited and acquired platelet dysfunction.,"Twenty-one patients with prolonged bleeding times secondary to inherited disorders of platelet function and eight patients with prolonged bleeding times secondary to acquired platelet dysfunction were given 0.3 micrograms per kilogram of DDAVP, 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, intravenously. Sixteen of twenty-two DDAVP trials in patients with inherited platelet dysfunction (73%) and seven of the nine DDAVP trials in patients with acquired platelet dysfunction (78%) resulted in normalization or shortening of the prolonged bleeding times by at least 4 min. The bleeding time response did not correlate with changes in the levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf) antigen or ristocetin cofactor activity, nor was it associated with changes in vWf multimeric analysis or in vitro platelet aggregations following the administration of DDAVP. Shortening of the bleeding time with DDAVP was seen in patients with a failure to release/storage pool type defect, thromboxane synthesis type defect, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, the May-Hegglin anomaly, liver disease, nonuremic renal disease, myelofibrosis, and Tangier's disease."
2018,29733120,Thymoquinone protects rat liver after partial hepatectomy under ischaemia/reperfusion through oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress prevention.,"Ischaemia reperfusion (I/R) is associated with liver injury and impaired regeneration during partial hepatectomy (PH). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the active compound of essential oil obtained from Nigella sativa seeds, on rat liver after PH. Male Wistar rats were divided equally into four groups (n = 6) receiving an oral administration of either vehicle solution (sham and PH groups) or TQ at 30 mg/kg (TQ and TQ + PH groups) for 10 consecutive days. Then, rats underwent PH (70%) with 60 minutes of ischaemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion (PH and TQ + PH groups). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and histopathological damage were determined. Also, antioxidant parameters, liver regeneration index, hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis were assessed. In response to PH under I/R, liver damage was significantly alleviated by TQ treatment as evidenced by the decrease in ALT activity (P < .01) and histological findings (P < .001). In parallel, TQ preconditioning increased hepatic antioxidant capacities. Moreover, TQ improved mitochondrial function (ATP, P < .05), attenuated ER stress parameters and repressed the expression of apoptotic effectors. Taken together, our results suggest that TQ preconditioning could be an effective strategy to reduce liver injury after PH under I/R. The protective effects were mediated by the increase of antioxidant capacities and the decrease of ER stress and apoptosis."
2010,20187987,Mulberry fruit protects dopaminergic neurons in toxin-induced Parkinson's disease models.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to the striatum (ST), and involves oxidative stress. Mulberry fruit from Morus alba L. (Moraceae) is commonly eaten, and has long been used in traditional oriental medicine. It contains well-known antioxidant agents such as anthocyanins. The present study examined the protective effects of 70 % ethanol extract of mulberry fruit (ME) against neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo PD models. In SH-SY5Y cells stressed with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), ME significantly protected the cells from neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Other assays demonstrated that the protective effect of ME was mediated by its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, regulating reactive oxygen species and NO generation, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and caspase-3 activation. In mesencephalic primary cells stressed with 6-OHDA or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), pre-treatment with ME also protected dopamine neurons, showing a wide range of effective concentrations in MPP+-induced toxicity. In the sub-acute mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), ME showed a preventative effect against PD-like symptoms (bradykinesia) in the behavioural test and prevented MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage in an immunocytochemical analysis of the SNpc and ST. These results indicate that ME has neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo PD models, and that it may be useful in preventing or treating PD."
2014,24253048,The atherogenic Scarb1 null mouse model shows a high bone mass phenotype.,"Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), the Scarb1 gene product, is a receptor associated with cholesteryl ester uptake from high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which drives cholesterol movement from peripheral tissues toward the liver for excretion, and, consequently, Scarb1 null mice are prone to atherosclerosis. Because studies have linked atherosclerosis incidence with osteoporosis, we characterized the bone metabolism in these mice. Bone morphometry was assessed through microcomputed tomography and histology. Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were used to characterize influence of endogenous SR-BI in cell functions. Total and HDL-associated cholesterol in null mice were increased by 32-60%, correlating with its role in lipoprotein metabolism. Distal metaphyses from 2- and 4-mo-old null mice showed correspondingly 46 and 37% higher bone volume fraction associated with a higher number of trabeculae. Histomorphometric analyses in 2-mo-old null male mice revealed 1.42-fold greater osteoblast surface, 1.37-fold higher percent mineralizing surface, and 1.69-fold enhanced bone formation rate. In vitro assays for MSCs from null mice revealed 37% higher proliferation rate, 48% more alkaline phosphatase activity, 70% greater mineralization potential and a 2-fold osterix (Sp7) expression, yet a 0.5-fold decrease in caveolin-1 (Cav1) expression. Selective uptake levels of HDL-associated cholesteryl oleate and estradiol were similar between MSC from wild-type and Scarb1 null mice, suggesting that its contribution to this process is not its main role in these cells. However, Scarb1 knockout stunted the HDL-dependent regulation of Cav1 genic expression. Scarb1 null mice are not prone to osteoporosis but show higher bone mass associated with enhanced bone formation."
2011,20875191,"Effect of dietary seaweed extracts and fish oil supplementation in sows on performance, intestinal microflora, intestinal morphology, volatile fatty acid concentrations and immune status of weaned pigs.","A 2x2 factorial experiment (ten sows per treatment) was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal dietary supplementation with a seaweed extract (SWE; 0 v. 10·0 g/d) and fish oil (FO; 0 v. 100 g/d) inclusion from day 109 of gestation until weaning (day 26) on pig performance post-weaning (PW) and intestinal morphology, selected microflora and immune status of pigs 9 d PW. The SWE contained laminarin (10 %), fucoidan (8 %) and ash (82 %) and the FO contained 40 % EPA and 25 % DHA. Pigs weaned from SWE-supplemented sows had higher daily gain (P=0·063) between days 0 and 21 PW and pigs weaned from FO-supplemented sows had higher daily gain (P<0·05) and gain to feed ratio (P<0·01) between days 7 and 14 PW. There was an interaction between maternal SWE and FO supplementation on caecal Escherichia coli numbers (P<0·05) and the villous height to crypt depth ratio in the ileum (P<0·01) and jejunum (P<0·05) in pigs 9 d PW. Pigs weaned from SWE-supplemented sows had lower caecal E. coli and a higher villous height to crypt depth ratio in the ileum and jejunum compared with non-SWE-supplemented sows (P<0·05). There was no effect of SWE on E. coli numbers and villous height to crypt depth ratio with FO inclusion. Maternal FO supplementation induced an increase in colonic mRNA abundance of IL-1α and IL-6 (P<0·05), while SWE supplementation induced an increase in ileal TNF-α (P<0·01) and colonic TFF3 mRNA expression (P<0·05). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that SWE and FO supplementation to the maternal diet influenced the gastrointestinal environment and performance of the weaned pig."
2019,30399592,Ginkgolide B enhances gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cell lines via inhibiting PAFR/NF-кB pathway.,"Gemcitabine resistance will occur by time after the initial response in pancreatic cancer. Ginkgolide B (GB), a major terpene lactone component of Ginkgo biloba leaves, is a highly selective and competitive inhibitor for platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of GB on gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability assay, flow cytometry, dual luciferase reporter assay and tumor xenograft model were used to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis, nuclear factor kappa b (NF-кB) activity in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence were used to shown different protein expression levels. We found the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of gemcitabine was significantly downregulated by GB in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GB could suppress cell proliferation, increase cell apoptosis and repress tumor growth when combined with gemcitabine, but had no effect when treated alone. Gemcitabine could upregulate PAFR and phosphorylated NF-кB/p65 expression, and increase NF-кB activity, but this was largely suppressed in combination with GB. GB could suppress PAFR expression in a dose-dependent manner. Knockout of PAFR significantly decreased phosphorylated NF-кB/p65 expression, inhibited NF-кB activity, increased gemcitabine sensitivity and cell apoptosis. Besides, GB had no influence on gemcitabine IC50 in IκBα-SR stably expressed BxPC-3 and CAPAN1. Our results suggested that GB could enhance gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cell lines by suppressing PAFR/NF-кB pathway. Thus GB may have therapeutic potential when used in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer."
2014,25241587,Protective effect of Dillenia indica L. on acetic acid induced colitis in mice.,"The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, immune mediated and chronic inflammation of the intestine. The study aimed to elucidate the ameliorative effect of methanolic extract of Dillenia indica (DIME), hexane fraction (HFDI) and chloroform fraction (CFDI) of Dillenia indica in acetic acid induced experimental colitis in mice. Macroscopic score, colon weight, colonic catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and histological changes were recorded after the treatment regimen of 7 days. Intra-rectal instillation of acetic acid caused enhanced macroscopic score, colon weight, colonic MPO, MDA, and TNF-alpha level. It caused significant decreased level of CAT, SOD and GSH. DIME (800 mg/kg), HFDI (200 mg/kg) and CFDI (200 mg/kg) treatment exhibited significant effect in lowering macroscopic score, colon weight, MPO, MDA, TNF-alpha levels and elevation of CAT, GSH and SOD levels. The results suggest that D. indica has ameliorating effects on experimental colitis by inhibiting the proinflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha production."
1999,10503899,Chemoprevention of heterocyclic amine-induced carcinogenesis by phenolic compounds in rats.,"Chemopreventive effects of synthetic and naturally occurring antioxidants on heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced rat carcinogenesis and mechanisms of inhibition were assessed. In a medium-term liver bioassay, combined treatment with 0.03% 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and synthetic antioxidants such as 1-O-hexyl-2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone (HTHQ), BHA, BHT, tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and propyl gallate, each at a dose of 0.25%, and troglitazone at doses 0.5 and 0.1%, potently inhibited development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci as compared with MeIQx alone values. Of these antioxidants, HTHQ showed the greatest activity. Green tea catechins tended to inhibit GST-P positive foci development, while quercetin, rutin, curcumin, daidzin, ferulic acid and genistin all exerted significant enhancing effects. HTHQ also inhibited 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced colon carcinogenesis in a two stage colon carcinogenesis model using 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) as an initiator. Immunohistochemically detected PhIP-DNA adduct positive nuclei in the colon induced by continuous oral treatment with 0.02% PhIP for 2 weeks decreased by the combined treatment with 0.5 or 0.125% HTHQ. Methoxyresorfin O-demethylase activity in rat liver microsomes in vitro was clearly inhibited by the addition of HTHQ, BHA, BHT, TBHQ or propyl gallate, with particularly strong inhibition being observed in HTHQ. However, the CYP1A2 level in rat liver increased after oral treatment with HTHQ for 2 weeks. These results indicate that synthetic antioxidants, HTHQ in particular, is a very strong chemopreventor of HCA-induced carcinogenesis. It is suggested that depression of metabolic activation rather than antioxidant activity is responsible for the observed effect. However, other mechanisms, including the effects on phase II enzymes cannot be ruled out."
1997,18982256,Ginseng intestinal bacterial metabolite IH901 as a new anti-metastatic agent.,"Anti-metastatic activities of IH901, an intestinal bacterial metabolic derivative formed from Ginseng protopanaxadiol saponins, was determinedin vitro andin vivo. Underin vitro conditions, IH901 inhibited the migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells 25 times stronger than suramin and suppressed the invasion of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells into reconstituted basement membrane components of Matrigel 1000 times stronger than RGDS peptide. IH901 also showed inhibitory effect on type-IV collagenase secretion from HT1080 cells and platelet aggregation. When the anti-metastatic activity of IH901 was evaluated in comparison with that of 5-FU using a spontaneous lung metastatic model of Lewis lung carcinoma, the administration of IH901 (10 mg/kg p. o.) to tumor-bearing mice led to a significant decrease in lung metastasis (43% of untreated control), which was slightly more effective than that obtained with 5-FU (56% of control). Thus, IH901 seems to exhibit its anti-metastatic activity partly through the inhibition of tumor invasion which results from the blockade of type IV collagenase secretion and also through anti-platelet and anti-angiogenic activities."
2019,30409664,Effect of nanocomposite-based packaging on microstructure and energy metabolism of Agaricus bisporus.,"Rapid deterioration of postharvest Agaricus bisporus is a serious problem. Measures to improve the shelf-life are of great importance. Therefore, we used a nanocomposite-based packaging material (Nano-PM) containing nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2, nano-Ag and attapulgite to study its effect on microstructure and energy metabolism of A. bisporus. Nano-PM reduced the oxidation of lipids and proteins by activating antioxidant enzyme activities and inhibiting the accumulation of ROS, thereby maintained high level of energy status. Meanwhile, ATP content and energy charge of A. bisporus in Nano-PM increased through the energy metabolism system. This was attributed to the lower respiration rate and higher mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. These results indicated that Nano-PM could maintain the dense and intact microstructure of A. bisporus thus improve its shelf-life."
2016,26846328,Ethanol extract of Pinus koraiensis leaves containing lambertianic acid exerts anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects by activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).,"In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity and anti-hyperlipidemic mechanisms of lambertianic acid (LA) isolated from Pinus koraiensis leaves and the ethanol extract of Pinus koraiensis leaves (EPK), both in vitro and in vivo.Differentiated 3T3L-1 cells were treated with EPK (25 or 50 μg/mL) or LA (200 μM) and analyzed by western blotting or RT-PCR. In vitro, lipid accumulation of adipocytes was observed using Oil-Red-O staining and triglyceride analysis. The contribution of AMPK to anti-obesity activity was assessed by siRNA-mediated AMPK knockdown. After AMPK silencing, expression of AMPK was observed by western blotting. To confirm the in vitro activity, an animal study was conducted by administering a normal diet, HFD, and EPK for 6 weeks. Obesity-related physiological parameters and protein levels were measured.LA induced the expression of p-AMPK and inhibited PPARγ, C/EBP α, adiponectin, FAS, SREBP-1, and HMGCR expression. EPK containing LA significantly decreased lipid accumulation and triglyceride levels in the differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells. EPK treatment suppressed the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, FABP, GPDH, and cholesterol-synthesis-related factors in the differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells. EPK increased the expression of p-AMPK. The effects of EPK were reversed on inhibiting AMPK by using AMPK siRNA and compound C. In vivo analysis showed that body weight gain, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and AI value in the EPK treatment group were lower than those in the HFD control group. EPK induced the expression of p-AMPK and inhibited PPARγ in liver and adipose tissue.Overall, the results suggest that EPK containing LA exerts significant anti-obesity and cholesterol-lowering effects by activating AMPK."
,12529982,Induction of apoptosis by iron depletion in the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line and the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma in vivo.,"It is known that the interruption of normal iron metabolism with chelators of iron, toxic metals, toxic metals bound to transferrin, or anti-transferrin receptor antibodies leads to significant inhibition of tumor cell growth in cell culture systems and animal models. In the present study, we found that iron depletion was produced by the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, the free toxic metals gallium or indium, and the toxic metals gallium or indium bound to transferrin in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, and this induced the condensation and fragmentation of chromatin, and the formation of DNA fragments characteristic of apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis was quantitated with acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining of apoptotic cells, separation of fragmented DNA from radiolabeled cells, and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The apoptosis, caused by deferoxamine mesylate, and gallium or indium bound to transferrin in the MCF-7 cells, can be completely inhibited by excess ferric chloride or equimolar iron-loaded transferrin. Gallium-transferrin and indium-transferrin complexes induced more apoptosis than their respective salts in the MCF-7 cells. Deferoxamine mesylate induced a small increase in the endogenous expression of both the bcl-2 and bax genes in the MCF-7 cells and this can be prevented by ferric chloride. In the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma model, in situ TUNEL assays showed that the iron-deficiency following a low iron diet or intravenous injection of deferoxamine mesylate produced 5.32 +/- 3.90% and 6.46 +/- 3.58% of apoptotic cells, respectively, compared to 2.01 +/- 1.20% of apoptotic cells in the control rats maintained on a normal diet (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, Student's t-test). This is the first report of iron depletion caused by a low iron diet or deferoxamine mesylate treatment inducing apoptosis in rats bearing the 13762NF marnmary adenocarcinoma."
1998,9808223,"Orange fruit is more effective than are dark-green, leafy vegetables in increasing serum concentrations of retinol and beta-carotene in schoolchildren in Indonesia.","The objectives of this study were to quantify the effectiveness of dietary retinol sources, orange fruit, and dark-green, leafy vegetables in improving vitamin A status, and to test whether orange fruit is a better source of vitamin A and carotenoids than are leafy vegetables. Anemic schoolchildren aged 7-11 y (n = 238) in West Java, Indonesia, were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups to consume 2 complete meals/d, 6 d/wk, for 9 wk: 1) 556 retinol equivalents (RE)/d from retinol-rich food (n = 48); 2) 509 RE/d from fruit (n = 49); 3) 684 RE/d from dark-green, leafy vegetables and carrots (n = 45); and 4) 44 RE/d from low-retinol, low-carotene food (n = 46). Mean changes in serum retinol concentrations of the retinol-rich, fruit, vegetable, and low-retinol, low-carotene groups were 0.23 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.28), 0.12 (0.06, 0.18), 0.07 (0.03,0.11), and 0.00 (-0.06, 0.05) micromol/L, respectively. Mean changes in serum beta-carotene concentrations in the vegetable and fruit groups were 0.14 (0.12, 0.17) and 0.52 (0.43, 0.60) micromol/L, respectively. Until now, it has been assumed that 6 microg dietary beta-carotene is equivalent to 1 RE. On the basis of this study, however, the equivalent of 1 RE would be 12 microg beta-carotene (95% CI: 6 microg, 29 microg) for fruit and 26 microg beta-carotene (95% CI: 13 microg, 76 microg) for leafy vegetables and carrots. Thus, the apparent mean vitamin A activity of carotenoids in fruit and in leafy vegetables and carrots was 50% (95% CI: 21%, 100%) and 23% (95% CI: 8%, 46%) of that assumed, respectively. This has important implications for choosing strategies for controlling vitamin A deficiency. Research should be directed toward ways of improving bioavailability and bioconversion of dietary carotenoids, focusing on factors such as intestinal parasites, absorption inhibitors, and food matrixes."
2019,29771623,Effects of an ethanolic extract of mulberry fruit on blood pressure and vascular remodeling in spontaneous hypertensive rats.,"Mulberry (Morus alba) has been used in traditional oriental medicine since ages. Recently, it has been reported that mulberry produces hypotensive effects through the eNOS signaling pathway. However, the mechanism underlying the hypotensive effects of mulberry is not entirely clear. Moreover, the effects of mulberry on vascular remodeling events such as hyperplasia, an important etiology in the pathogenesis of hypertension and arteriosclerosis, are also ambiguous. Here, we hypothesized that an ethanolic extract of mulberry fruit (EMF) has beneficial effects on vascular remodeling and produces hypotensive effects. The effects of a 6-week oral administration of EMF were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The animals were divided into four groups: normotensive control (Wistar Kyoto rats), non-treated SHR, low-dose (100 mg/kg) EMF-treated SHR, and high-dose (300 mg/kg) EMF-treated SHR. Our results showed that the EMF-diet normalizes hypertension in SHRs in a dose-dependent manner, by preventing smooth muscle proliferation, thickening of the tunica media, and vascular hyper-reactivity. The endothelial functions were not substantially affected by the EMF diet in our experimental setting. In conclusion, we suggest that the mulberry fruit could act as a food supplement for reducing blood pressure in hypertensive subjects through its effects on smooth muscle proliferation and vascular contractility."
2016,26471673,Functional and antioxidant properties of hydrolysates of sardine (S. pilchardus) and horse mackerel (T. mediterraneus) for the microencapsulation of fish oil by spray-drying.,"The functionality of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) for the microencapsulation of fish oil was investigated. Muscle protein from sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) was hydrolysed using Alcalase or trypsin. Physically stable emulsions suitable for spray-drying were obtained when using FPH with a degree of hydrolysis of 5%. Microencapsulation efficiency amounted to 98±0.1% and oxidative stability of the encapsulated oil over a period of twelve weeks was in a similar range as it is reported for other matrix systems. Therefore, the suitability of FPH for use in spray-dried emulsions has been shown for the first time. Since no clear correlation between the antioxidative activity of the FPH and the course of lipid oxidation could be established future research is required to more specifically characterise the molecular structure of the peptides and its impact on protein alteration and role in lipid oxidation."
2014,25170121,Phase 3 clinical trial of steroids/mycophenolate mofetil vs steroids/placebo as therapy for acute GVHD: BMT CTN 0802.,"Corticosteroids are the accepted primary therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but durable responses are seen in only about half of the patients. Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0802, a phase 3 multicenter randomized double-blinded trial, was designed to test whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) plus corticosteroids was superior to corticosteroids alone as initial therapy for acute GVHD. Patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD were eligible if they required systemic therapy. Patients were randomized to receive prednisone with either MMF or placebo. The primary end point was acute or chronic GVHD-free survival at day 56 after initiation of therapy. A futility rule for GVHD-free survival at day 56 was met at a planned interim analysis after 235 patients (of 372) were enrolled: 116 MMF, 119 placebo. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups including grade and organ distribution of GVHD. GVHD-free survival at day 56, cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 12 months, overall survival, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, severe, life-threatening infections, relapse at 12 months, and quality of life were similar. The addition of MMF to corticosteroids as initial therapy for acute GVHD does not improve GVHD-free survival compared with corticosteroids alone. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01002742. "
2005,16286817,Extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves reverses yohimbine-induced spatial working memory deficit in rats.,"Extract of Ginkgo biloba is used to alleviate age-related decline in cognitive function, which may be associated with the loss of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex. The purpose of this study was to verify whether alpha-2 adrenergic activity is involved in the facilitative effects of extract of Ginkgo biloba on prefrontal cognitive function. Male Wistar rats were trained to reach criterion in the delayed alternation task (0, 25, and 50-s delay intervals). A pilot study found that 3 or 4 mg/kg of yohimbine (intraperitoneal) reduced the choice accuracy of the delayed alternation task in a dose and delay-dependent manner, without influencing motor ability or perseverative behaviour. Acute oral pre-treatment with doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg (but not 25 mg/kg) of extract of Ginkgo biloba prevented the reduction in choice accuracy induced by 4 mg/kg yohimbine. These data suggest that the prefrontal cognition-enhancing effects of extract of Ginkgo biloba are related to its actions on alpha-2-adrenoceptors."
2006,16432096,Risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients taking warfarin: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation 2.,"Vitamin K allows for gamma-carboxylation of glutamyl residues, a conversion that activates clotting factors and bone proteins. Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin inhibit this process. Our goal was to quantify the association between warfarin and osteoporotic fractures in patients with atrial fibrillation.This was a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation who were hospitalized between March 1998 and April 1999 in all 50 US states. The study outcome was osteoporotic fractures, identified by an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for a fracture of the hip, spine, or wrist.Compared with 7587 patients who were not prescribed warfarin, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of fracture was 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.48) in 4461 patients prescribed long-term warfarin therapy (> or = 1 year). The association between osteoporotic fracture and long-term warfarin use was significant in men (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.26-2.10) but nonsignificant in women (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.26). In 1833 patients prescribed warfarin for less than a year, the risk of osteoporotic fracture was not increased significantly (OR, 1.03). Odds ratios (95% CIs) of independent predictors of osteoporotic fractures were as follows: increasing age, 1.63 (1.47-1.80) per decade; high fall risk, 1.78 (1.42-2.21); hyperthyroidism, 1.77 (1.16-2.70); neuropsychiatric disease, 1.51 (1.28-1.78); and alcoholism, 1.50 (1.01-2.24). Factors with a reduced OR (95% CI) included African American race, 0.30 (0.18-0.51); male sex, 0.54 (0.46-0.62); and use of beta-adrenergic antagonists, 0.84 (0.70-1.00).Long-term use of warfarin was associated with osteoporotic fractures, at least in men with atrial fibrillation. Beta-adrenergic antagonists may protect against osteoporotic fractures."
2008,18606398,Resveratrol suppresses interleukin-1beta-induced inflammatory signaling and apoptosis in human articular chondrocytes: potential for use as a novel nutraceutical for the treatment of osteoarthritis.,"Osteoarthritis is an inflammatory disease of load-bearing synovial joints that is currently treated with drugs that exhibit numerous side effects and are only temporarily effective on pain, the main symptom of the disease. Consequently, there is an acute need for novel, safe and more effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoarthritis and related arthritic diseases. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin stilbene produced naturally by plants including red grapes, peanuts and various berries. Recent research in various cell models has demonstrated that resveratrol is safe and has potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, its potential for treating arthritic conditions has not been explored. In this study we provide experimental evidence that resveratrol inhibits the expression of VEGF, MMP-3, MMP-9 and COX-2 in human articular chondrocytes stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. Since these gene products are regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappaB, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Resveratrol, like N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) suppressed IL-1beta-induced proteasome function and the degradation of IkappaBalpha (an inhibitor of NF-kappaB) without affecting IkappaBalpha kinase activation, IkappaBalpha-phosphorylation or IkappaBalpha-ubiquitination which suppressed nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and its phosphorylation. Furthermore, we observed that resveratrol as well as ALLN inhibited IL-1beta-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in human articular chondrocytes. In summary, our results suggest that resveratrol suppresses apoptosis and inflammatory signaling through its actions on the NF-kappaB pathway in human chondrocytes. We propose that resveratrol should be explored further for the prophylactic treatment of osteoarthritis in humans and companion animals."
2017,27542478,"Photoproduction of glyoxylic acid in model wine: Impact of sulfur dioxide, caffeic acid, pH and temperature.","Glyoxylic acid is a tartaric acid degradation product formed in model wine solutions containing iron and its production is greatly increased by exposure to UV-visible light. In this study, the combined effect of sulfur dioxide, caffeic acid, pH and temperature on the light-induced (⩾300nm) production of glyoxylic acid in model wine containing tartaric acid and iron was investigated using a Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM). Glyoxylic acid produced in the irradiated model wine was present in free and hydrogen sulfite adduct forms and the measured total, free and percentage free glyoxylic acid values were modeled using RSM. Sulfur dioxide significantly decreased the total amount of glyoxylic acid produced, but could not prevent its production, while caffeic acid showed no significant impact. The interaction between pH and temperature was significant, with low pH values and low temperatures giving rise to higher levels of total glyoxylic acid. "
2014,24399368,A molecular-based approach for examining responses of eukaryotes in microcosms to contaminant-spiked estuarine sediments.,"Ecotoxicological information for most contaminants is limited to a small number of taxa, and these are generally restricted to comparatively hardy organisms that are readily extractable from test media and easily identifiable. Advances in DNA sequencing can now provide a comprehensive view of benthic invertebrate diversity. The authors applied 454 pyrosequencing to examine the responses of benthic communities in microcosms exposed to sediments with elevated concentrations of triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low triclosan [14 mg/kg], and high triclosan [180 mg/kg]) clustered into 3 groups: control/low (n = 6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n = 2 low), and high (n = 5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of metazoan operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicative of the control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and the phylum Kinorhyncha. The authors also describe a range of other taxa that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional approaches. The described approach illustrates the capacity for amplicon sequencing to provide ecologically relevant information that can be used to strengthen an understanding of how sedimentary communities respond to a range of environmental stressors."
2016,26213093,Effects of chemical treatments on fresh-cut papaya.,"Four treatments (control, 0.1% cinnamaldehyde, 0.75% calcium chloride and combination of 0.1% cinnamaldehyde and 0.75% calcium chloride) were used to evaluate chemical effects on shelf life, quality and sensory acceptability of fresh-cut papaya (Carica papaya L.). Papaya slices were packed and covered with polypropylene film, stored at 5 °C; and evaluated after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days for microbiological and physicochemical changes. A sensory evaluation was performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days. There was no occurrence of Salmonella, Escherichia coli or psychotropic bacteria. The cinnamaldehyde alone and a combination of cinnamaldehyde and calcium chloride treatments yielded better control of the total coliforms. The combination treatment decreased the CO2 concentration and increased the maintenance of papaya firmness. All the treatments had acceptability. The combination treatment was the most effective treatment for flavor, taste, and preservation until day 12."
2007,17202689,Human acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitory activities of aliphatic acid amides from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC.,"Acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) plays an important role in the esterification of cholesterol with its substrates, cholesterol and fatty acyl coenzyme A, to facilitate both intracellular storage and intercellular transport. ACAT-1 is more involved in macrophage foam cell formation and ACAT-2 plays a critical role in the cholesterol absorption process in intestinal enterocytes. Three aliphatic acid amides, beta-sanshool (1), gamma-sanshool (2), and hydroxy-beta-sanshool (3), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extracts of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited human ACAT-1 and -2 activities with IC50 values of 39.0 and 79.7 microM for 1 and of 12.0 and 82.6 microM for 2, respectively. However, the hACAT-1 and -2 inhibitory activities of compound 3 having hydroxyl group were relatively less than those of compounds 1 and 2. A semi-synthetic compound 4, which has acetyl residue at 2'-OH of compound 3, exhibited the increased hACAT-1 and -2 inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 28.1 and 87.5 microM, respectively."
2005,16115361,Lactococcus lactis is capable of improving the riboflavin status in deficient rats.,"Lactococcus lactis is a commonly used starter strain that can be converted from a vitamin B2 consumer into a vitamin B2 'factory' by over-expressing its riboflavin biosynthesis genes. The present study was conducted to assess in a rat bioassay the response of riboflavin produced by GM or native lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The riboflavin-producing strains were able to eliminate most physiological manifestations of ariboflavinosis such as stunted growth, elevated erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient values and hepatomegalia that were observed using a riboflavin depletion-repletion model. Riboflavin status and growth rates were greatly improved when the depleted rats were fed with cultures of L. lactis that overproduced this vitamin whereas the native strain did not show the same effect. The present study is the first animal trial with food containing living bacteria that were engineered to overproduce riboflavin. These results pave the way for analysing the effect of similar riboflavin-overproducing LAB in human trials."
2019,31414619,"Comparing the effects of Portulaca oleracea seed hydro-alcoholic extract, valsartan, and vitamin E on hemodynamic changes, oxidative stress parameters and cardiac hypertrophy in thyrotoxic rats.","The present study compared the effects of Portulaca oleracea (P. oleracea) seed hydro-alcoholic extract, valsartan, and vitamin E on hemodynamic changes, oxidative stress markers and cardiac hypertrophy in a model of thyrotoxicosis. The hyperthyroid state was induced by intraperitoneal injection of levothyroxine (100 µg/kg) for 4 weeks in male adult rats. After 2 weeks, vitamin E (20 mg/kg), valsartan (8 mg/kg), and P. oleracea seed extract (400 mg/kg) were administered in three groups of thyrotoxic rats. The control group was given a daily injection of normal saline. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured on three occasions with tail cuff. At the end of the fourth week, the animals were scarified and serum samples and heart tissue were collected for biochemical and histological studies. The levothyroxine increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. A lower heart rate and reduced systolic blood pressure were observed in groups receiving valsartan and P. oleracea extract. The heart weight/body weight ratio increased in groups treated with levothyroxine, but in a microscopic study, cardiomyocyte width was not different between the groups. Levothyroxine increased the level of malondyaldehide and NO metabolite but reduced the thiol concentration, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities. However, treatment with vitamin E and P. oleracea extract increased the thiol concentration, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities while decreasing malondyaldehide level. In addition, treatment with P. oleracea extract and valsartan decreased NO metabolite level. Treatment with P. oleracea extract improved levothyroxine induced oxidative stress and hemodynamic changes. These effects may be for antioxidant components."
,1535769,Chemotherapy of murine colorectal carcinoma with cisplatin and cisplatin plus 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine.,"In light of the discouraging results obtained with conventional chemotherapy of human colon cancer using 5-fluorouracil, we examined the effects of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin) alone and combined with 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine (AZT) on chemotherapy of colorectal adenocarcinomas induced by dimethyldrazine in CD-1 mice. Thirteen weeks after a 20 week tumor induction period (15 mg/kg dimethylhydrazine weekly) groups of 19 mice were given either no therapy, or weekly cisplatin (6 mg/kg for 4 wks), AZT (400 mg/kg, wks 3 and 4), or cisplatin and AZT. Animals were autospied at death or after euthanasia on day 99 post initiation of therapy, their colons excised, fixed in buffered formalin and the number and volume of tumors measured. Cisplatin alone or with AZT decreased tumor size by 47-52%, and enhanced survival, leaving 55% of the mice alive at day 99 compared to 18% in controls. These therapeutic effects were amplified when animals were given chemotherapy during recovery from the effects of short-term dietary provision of the anti-carcinogenic steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Our results suggest cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent against colon cancer in this murine model, and warrant further studies of its interaction with AZT and DHEA in enhancing this effect."
2018,29412905,"Effect of lactobacillus strains on phenolic profile, color attributes and antioxidant activities of lactic-acid-fermented mulberry juice.","This study was conducted to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on color properties, phenolic profile and antioxidant activities of mulberry juice. Mulberry juice was separately fermented at 37 °C for 36 h using Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei. The results showed that lactic acid fermentation impacted on the color of the juice. Moreover, the study demonstrated that LABs impacted on the phenolic profile of the juice. Syringic acid, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and quercetin were the predominant phenolic acid, anthocyanin and flavonol respectively in the lactic-acid-fermented mulberry juice. The degree of radical scavenging activity was species-specific with the L. plantarum fermented juice having the highest radical scavenging activities. The correlation analysis demonstrated that flavonols and anthocyanins were mostly responsible for the increased in 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) scavenging activity while phenolic acids and flavonols were responsible for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity and reducing power capacity of the fermented juice."
2018,30021358,"Therapeutic effect of vitamin B3 on hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and DNA damage in alloxan induced diabetic rat model.","Evidences in the form of experimental analysis and scientific investigations suggest that oxidative stress embody an imperative role in the onset and progression of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Aberrant elevation in levels of free radicals, as observed upon disease onset, and the subsequent reduction in anti-oxidant defenses is pernicious to metabolic enzymes and cellular organelles. Niacin (Vitamin B3) is an essential nutrient for humans and is considered to be an important food additive for animals too. This research was conducted to examine the effect of nutraceutical antioxidant on diabetic environment. This important member of Vitamin B complex is a forerunner of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and also nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), both of them serving as coenzymes for several metabolic enzymes. This study reports the effects of niacin supplementation in alloxan induced diabetic rats divided into five groups. Diabetes induced rats were further treated with niacin at two doses (10 and 15 mg /kg body weight) and compared with a control set of diabetes without treatment. Niacin treatment showed recovery in almost all parameters in a dose reliant pattern. A notable decline in oxidative stress parameters with reductions in fasting blood glucose levels was observed. Histological studies reveal damage recovery in the liver as well as kidney tissues. A notable amount of recovery was observed in cellular DNA damage. As a deduction, it is advocated that dietary niacin supplementation might help in reducing problems associated with diabetes. A probable mechanism pertaining to the action of niacin is proposed as well."
2014,24423510,Amino acid composition of algal products and its contribution to RDI.,"In this paper, the amino acid profiles of algal products from diverse groups (Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Phaeophyta) were established. Contents of essential and non-essential amino acids varied in the range of 22.8-42.3 and 31.0-66.5 (g·16 g(-1)N), respectively. In dependence on daily algal intakes, the highest participation in recommended daily intakes (RDI; related to adult, body weight of 70 kg) of all EAAs was observed in freshwater micro-algal products, especially from Spirulina genus where contribution ranged from 12.6% (Lys, SB) to 38.8% (Thr, S). Generally, Lys was the lowest contributor to RDIs in almost all algal samples except Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C) and Palmaria palmata (D), where Ile and Leu, respectively, were established. Interestingly, the contents of sulfur AAs of both products of the Spirulina genus covered 74.5% (S) and 73.8% (SB) of their RDI. Finally, products from brown seaweeds showed the lowest contributions to the RDIs of all EAAs."
1986,3022625,"Quantitative studies of erythropoiesis in the clinically normal, phlebotomized, and feline leukemia virus-infected cat.","Erythropoiesis was evaluated in 5 cats at base line with normal PCV and then in the same cats with anemia induced by phlebotomy and in 5 other cats with nonregenerative anemia from community-acquired feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. The hematologic evaluation included complete blood cell and reticulocyte counts, marrow morphologic features, determination of serum erythropoietin concentrations by radioimmunoassay, ferrokinetic studies, and in vitro marrow culture of early erythroid progenitors (erythroid burst-forming units; BFU-E) and late erythroid progenitors (erythroid colony-forming units; CFU-E). Phlebotomized cats developed marrow erythroid hyperplasia and an increased reticulocyte count. Ferrokinetic studies revealed an increase in plasma iron turnover from 1.4 to 3.8 mg of Fe/dl of blood/day and RBC use from 50.4% to 78.5%. The mean CFU-E number and CFU-E/BFU-E ratio increased after phlebotomy, but the increase was not significant (P greater than 0.05). Serum erythropoietin values did increase significantly. In FeLV-infected cats, a nonregenerative anemia was demonstrated by marrow erythroid hypoplasia and a low total reticulocyte count. An increased percentage of rubriblasts and prorubricytes was observed in 4 of the 5 cats. Although serum erythropoietin values were high (321 +/- 123 mU/ml vs normal 14 +/- 1 mU/ml), ferrokinetic data revealed decreased erythropoiesis. Marrow culture studies in the FeLV-infected cats also revealed low numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E, but normal numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors remained. Seemingly, the FeLV infection impaired the ability of feline marrow to respond physiologically to anemia."
2011,21402854,Sesame oil prevents acute kidney injury induced by the synergistic action of aminoglycoside and iodinated contrast in rats.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of sesame oil on acute kidney injury induced by the synergistic action of aminoglycoside and iodinated contrast in rats. Acute kidney injury was induced by a 5-day course of daily gentamicin injections (100 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously) and then iodinated contrast (4 ml/kg, intravenously) in male specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats. Sesame oil (0.5 ml/kg, orally) was given 1 h before iodinated contrast. Renal function and oxidative stress were assessed 6 h after iodinated contrast injection. Renal function was evaluated by measuring serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Renal oxidative stress was assessed by determining renal lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase, hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, nitrite/nitrate, and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels. Sesame oil significantly prevented the rise of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Furthermore, there was a parallel inhibition of the rise in levels of expression of renal lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion, nitrite/nitrate, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in rats with gentamicin-plus-iodinated contrast-induced acute kidney injury. We conclude that sesame oil may attenuate aminoglycoside-plus-iodinated contrast-induced acute kidney injury by inhibiting renal oxidative stress in rats."
2011,21044624,Indole-3-carbinol inhibits hepatic stellate cells proliferation by blocking NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species/p38 MAPK pathway.,"During the course of liver fibrogenesis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation as well as subsequent synthesis of excessive extracellular matrix components is known to be the central events. Thus, factors that could limit HSC proliferation are potential anti-fibrotic agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a nutritional component derived from Brassica family vegetables, on the proliferation of cultured HSC and to clarify the underline molecular mechanism. HSC-T6, an activated rat HSC line, was treated with I3C (50, 100 and 200 μM) for 24 h. The results indicated that I3C can significantly inhibit HSC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with or without platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) stimulation (P<0.01). I3C could also block HSC in the G(0)/G(1) phase from entering the S phase. The expressions of α-smooth muscle actin in HSC treated with I3C, were significantly decreased at levels of protein and mRNA (P<0.01). In addition, the type I collagen level, cyclin D(1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 mRNA expressions, intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species generation were significantly decreased by I3C (P<0.05). We also observed that the phosphorylated p38 MAPK in HSC-T6 was inhibited by I3C in a concentration-dependent manner; however, the phosphorylated ERK1/2 was unaltered. In conclusion, I3C could inhibit the proliferation of HSC by blocking the NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species/p38 MAPK signal pathway. These findings suggest that dietary I3C might play a novel role in prevention and treatment of chronic liver diseases."
2015,25842337,"Effects of gluten-free breads, with varying functional supplements, on the biochemical parameters and antioxidant status of rat serum.","This paper examines the effects of gluten-free bread enriched with functional ingredients (milk powder, poppy, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, egg yolk, carum, hazel nuts and amaranth) on the morphological and biochemical parameters and antioxidant status of rats serum. Rats were provided test diets--gluten-free breads and water ad libitum. After 14 days, the animals were weighed and killed. A hazel nut-amaranth bread diet significantly increased the level of thrombocytes when compared to control bread. A mixed bread diet significantly decreased cholesterol levels in rats. All fortified breads decreased triglyceride levels and alanine transaminase activity and caused an increase in antiradical activity of the serum. In rats fed with poppy-milk bread, milk-seed bread and mixed bread, a marked decrease in superoxide dismutase activity was found. Enriched breads reduced the levels of triglyceride and improved the antiradical properties of serum, although the physiological relevance of this needs to be confirmed by human studies."
2003,12838283,IL-2-based immunotherapy after autologous transplantation for lymphoma and breast cancer induces immune activation and cytokine release: a phase I/II trial.,"We determined the safety, immune activating effects, and potential efficacy of i.v. infusion of ex vivo interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated natural killer (NK) cells (part I) or IL-2 boluses (part II) during daily s.c. IL-2 administration following hematopoietic recovery from autologous transplantation. In all, 57 patients with relapsed lymphoma (n=29) or metastatic breast cancer (n=28) were enrolled. In part I of the study, 34 patients were enrolled at three dose levels of ex vivo IL-2-activated NK cells. Lymphaphereses were performed on days 28 and 42 of s.c. IL-2 administration. Following overnight ex vivo IL-2 activation of the pheresis product, the cells were reinfused the following day. In part II, 23 patients were enrolled at three dose levels of supplemental i.v. IL-2 bolus infusions, given on days 28 and 35 during s.c. IL-2 administration. Toxicities were generally mild, and no patient required hospitalization. Lytic function was markedly enhanced for fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) obtained 1 day postinfusion of either IL-2-activated cells or IL-2 boluses. IL-2 boluses transiently increased the levels of IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL1-beta, with increases in IL-6 and IFN-gamma being dose dependent. A total of 37 patients (19 patients with lymphoma, 18 with breast cancer) treated with an optimum dose of post-transplant immunotherapy (defined as having received 1.75 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day of s.c. IL-2 plus at least one of the planned ex vivo IL-2-activated cell infusions/IL-2 boluses) could be matched with controls from the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry database. The matched-pairs analysis demonstrated no improvement in disease outcomes of survival and relapse. We conclude that IL-2-activated cells/IL-2 boluses can be safely administered, generate PBMNCs with enhanced cytotoxicity against NK-resistant targets, and increase cytokine levels. With this dose and schedule of administration of IL-2, no improvement in patient disease outcomes was noted. Alternative strategies will be needed to exploit the immunotherapeutic potential of IL-2-activated NK cells."
2019,29869015,Effect of Boron on the Repair of Osteochondral Defect and Oxidative Stress in Rats: an Experimental Study.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of boron on the repair of osteochondral defect and also on some antioxidant and oxidant parameters of both cartilage tissue and blood. A total of 24 adult male Wistar rats weighing between 350 and 400 g were used in the study. Animals were randomly divided into control (n = 8), boron (n = 8) and hyaluronic acid (HA) groups (n = 8). Under general anesthesia, a cylindrical full-thickness osteochondral defect 1.5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth was formed using a drill on the anterior side of the articular surface of the femur condyle. Boron group received 0.1 ml (10 mg/kg) of boron and HA group received 0.1 ml of HA, whereas control group received 0.1 ml of physiological saline solution. All agents administered intraarticular route and once a week for four times. At the end of the third month, the animals were euthanized and blood and joint tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase levels were measured. Defected femoral condyles of the rats were removed for a histopathological examination. Histopathology revealed that the total cartilage repair score of the HA group was better than those detected in boron and control groups. Blood and articular cartilage GSH, SOD, and catalase levels were higher in the boron and HA groups as compared to the control group, while MDA level was lower compared to the control group. In conclusion, it was suggested that boron was not as effective as HA in the repair of osteochondral defect, but its antioxidant property was superior to HA."
2005,16294503,Efficacy of troxerutin on streptozotocin-induced rat model in the early stage of diabetic retinopathy.,"The vascular changes associated with early diabetic retinopathy, which include the formation of microaneurysms and acellular capillaries, vessel dilation, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, were investigated experimentally in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats treated with antioxidants: troxerutin (trihydroxy-ethylrutoside, CAS 7085-55-4), Vaccinium myrtillus, and calcium dobesilate (hydroquinone calcium sulfonate, CAS 20123-80-2). The development and progression of retinopathy was followed using fundus photography. After 3 months, the rats were sacrificed and half of the eyes were prepared for neovascularization analysis, and the other half were used for VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) analysis. The results from fundus photography and ADPase (adenosine diphosphatase) staining were quantified by the percentage area of the retinal vasculature using a commercial image analyzer. The VEGF protein in the retinal homogenates was assessed using an ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) kit and VEGF-mRNA by RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). In the ADPase stain, the retinal vascular percent area increased significantly in the diabetic control. Neovascularization and aneurysms were observed in the diabetic control and were attenuated by 50 mg/kg troxerutin, but the retinal vascular percentage area was not significantly different from the diabetic control. The VEGF protein concentration was higher in diabetic rats than in the nondiabetic rats (21.5 +/- 2.1 vs 27.7 +/- 5.8 pg/mg, p < 0.05), and this increase was attenuated by 10 mg/kg troxerutin (24.5 +/- 3.8 pg/mg, p < 0.05) and prevented by 50 mg/kg troxerutin (19.5 +/- 2.2 pg/mg, p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the groups. The VEGF-mRNA density showed a increasing tendency by 20% in the diabetic rats compared with the non-diabetic rats (1.0 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 VEGF/beta-actin), and this increase was corrected by 10 mg/kg troxerutin (1.0 +/- 0.1 VEGF/beta-actin), 50 mg/kg troxerutin (0.9 +/- 0.1 VEGF/beta-actin) and Vaccinium myrtillus (1.1 +/- 0.1 VEGF/beta-actin). Oxidative stress might be involved in the upregulation of retinal VEGF during early diabetes, and it is likely that troxerutin has comparatively effective antioxidant properties. Therefore, troxerutin might be a useful treatment for attenuating diabetic retinopathy."
2014,25436226,Acaricidal activity of petroleum ether extract of leaves of Tetrastigma leucostaphylum (Dennst.) Alston against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus.,"The acaricidal activity of the petroleum ether extract of leaves of Tetrastigma leucostaphylum (Dennst.) Alston (family: Vitaceae) against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus was assessed using adult immersion test (AIT). The per cent of adult mortality, inhibition of fecundity, and blocking of hatching of eggs were studied at different concentrations. The extract at 10% concentration showed 88.96% inhibition of fecundity, 58.32% of adult tick mortality, and 50% inhibition of hatching. Peak mortality rate was observed after day 5 of treatment. Mortality of engorged female ticks, inhibition of fecundity, and hatching of eggs were concentration dependent. The LC50 value of the extract against R. (B.) annulatus was 10.46%. The HPTLC profiling of the petroleum ether extract revealed the presence of at least seven polyvalent components. In the petroleum ether extract, nicotine was identified as one of the components up to a concentration of 5.4%. However, nicotine did not reveal any acaricidal activity up to 20000 ppm (2%). Coconut oil, used as diluent for dissolving the extract, did not reveal any acaricidal effects. The results are indicative of the involvement of synergistic or additive action of the bioactive components in the tick mortality and inhibition of the oviposition. "
2014,25311097,Effects of Salvia sclarea on chronic immobilization stress induced endothelial dysfunction in rats.,"Although Salvia sclarea (clary sage) is widely used in aromatherapy and has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We therefore assessed whether clary sage is effective in treating endothelial dysfunction induced by chronic immobilization stress in rats.Rats were intraperitoneally injected with almond oil, clary sage oil (5%, 10% or 20%), or nifedipine once daily, followed by immobilization stress (2 h/day) for 14 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured, as were serum concentrations of corticosterone (CORT); a biomarker of chronic stress, malondialdehyde (MDA); a biomarker of oxidative stress. Nitric oxide production was assessed by nitrite assays, and eNOS level, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, was measured by western blotting. Endothelial dysfunction was also assayed by measuring the effect of clary sage on the contraction of rat aortae.Treatment with 5% (p = 0.029), 10% (p = 0.008), and 20% (p = 0.008) clary sage significantly reduced SBP and treatment with 20% clary sage significantly reduced HR (p = 0.039) compared with the chronic immobilization stress group. Clary sage decreased CORT serum concentration (10%, p = 0.026; 20%, p = 0.012) and MDA (10%, p = 0.007; 20%, p = 0.027), findings similar to those observed with nifedipine. In addition, 20% clary sage significantly increased nitric oxide production (p <0.001) and eNOS expression level (p <0.001) and relaxed aortic rings in rats subjected to chronic immobilization stress.Clary sage treatment of rats subjected to immobilization stress contributed to their recovery from endothelial dysfunction by increasing NO production and eNOS level as well as by decreasing oxidative stress. Appropriate concentration of clary sage may result in recovery from endothelial dysfunction. These findings indicate that clary sage oil may be effective in the prevention and treatment of stress-induced cardiovascular diseases."
2017,28356100,Bioactivity of arid region honey: an in vitro study.,"Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of honey have been largely recognized by various studies. Almost all of the potential benefits are associated with polyphenol content. Honey varieties from the arid region are reported to be rich in polyphenols, but data related to its bioactivity in vitro is greatly lacking. This study aimed at establishing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of arid region honey. Four honey varieties from arid region (H1, H2, H3, and H4) and two popular non-arid region honey (H5 and H6) were tested in vitro in this study.The erythrocyte membrane protection effect of honey varieties were measured by hemolysis assay after exposing erythrocytes to a peroxide generator. The subsequent production of MDA (malondialdehyde) content in erythrocytes was measured. Immunomodulatory effect of the honey varieties was tested in prostate cancer cells PC-3 and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) by measuring the IL-6 (interleukin 6) and NO (nitric oxide) levels in cell culture supernatant after incubation with the honey varieties. PC-3 cell viability was assessed after incubation with honey varieties for 24 h.Arid region honey exhibited superior erythrocyte membrane protection effect with H4 measuring 1.3 ± 0.042mMTE/g and H2 measuring 1.122 ± 0.018mMTE/g. MDA levels were significantly reduced by honey samples, especially H4 (20.819 ± 0.63 nmol/mg protein). We observed a significant decrease in cell population in PC-3 after 24 h in culture on treatment with honey. A moderate increase in NO levels was observed in both cultures after 24 h at the same time levels of IL-6 were remarkably reduced by honey varieties.The results demonstrate the antioxidant effect of arid region honey due to its erythrocyte membrane protection effect and subsequent lowering of oxidative damage as evident from lower levels of lipid peroxidation byproduct MDA. Arid region honey varieties were as good as non-arid region types at decreasing cell viability of prostate cancer cells. The moderate increase in NO levels in PC-3 and PBMCs were not significant enough to elicit any pro-inflammatory response. However, IL-6 secretion was remarkably reduced by all honey varieties in a comparable level indicating the potential anti-inflammatory property of arid region honey."
2007,17351656,"Interactions between NO, CO and an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus in the mouse.","Prenatal patency of ductus arteriosus is maintained by prostaglandin (PG) E(2), possibly along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), and cyclooxygenase (COX) deletion upregulates NO. Here, we have examined enzyme source and action of NO for ductus patency and whether NO and CO are upregulated by deletion of, respectively, heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) and COX1 or COX2.Experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo with wild-type and gene-deleted, near-term mouse fetuses.N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) contracted the isolated ductus and its effect was reduced by eNOS, but not iNOS, deletion. L-NAME contraction was not modified by HO-2 deletion. Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) also contracted the ductus, an action unaffected by deletion of either COX isoform. Bradykinin (BK) relaxed indomethacin-contracted ductus similarly in wild-type and eNOS-/- or iNOS-/-. BK relaxation was suppressed by either L-NAME or ZnPP. However, it reappeared with combined L-NAME and ZnPP to subside again with K(+) increase or K(+) channel inhibition. In vivo, the ductus was patent in wild-type and NOS-deleted fetuses. Likewise, no genotype-related difference was noted in postnatal closure.NO, formed mainly via eNOS, regulates ductal tone. NO and CO cooperatively mediate BK-induced relaxation in the absence of PGE(2). However, in the absence of PGE(2), NO and CO, BK induces a relaxant substance behaving as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Ductus patency is, therefore, sustained by a cohort of agents with PGE(2) and NO being preferentially coupled for reciprocal compensation."
2017,28754820,An Integrative Scoring System for Survival Prediction Following Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Acute Leukemia.,"Purpose: Survival of acute leukemia (AL) patients following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is dependent on an array of individual features. Integrative models for risk assessment are lacking. We sought to develop a scoring system for prediction of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years following UCBT in AL patients.Experimental Design: The study cohort included 3,140 pediatric and adult AL UCBT patients from the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Eurocord registries. Patients received single or double cord blood units. The dataset was geographically split into a derivation (n = 2,362, 65%) and validation set (n = 778, 35%). Top predictors of OS were identified using the Random Survival Forest algorithm and introduced into a Cox regression model, which served for the construction of the UCBT risk score.Results: The score includes nine variables: disease status, diagnosis, cell dose, age, center experience, cytomegalovirus serostatus, degree of HLA mismatch, previous autograft, and anti-thymocyte globulin administration. Over the validation set an increasing score was associated with decreasing probabilities for 2 years OS and LFS, ranging from 70.21% [68.89-70.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 64.76% (64.33-65.86, 95% CI) to 14.78% (10.91-17.41) and 18.11% (14.40-22.30), respectively. It stratified patients into six distinct risk groups. The score's discrimination (AUC) over multiple imputations of the validation set was 68.76 (68.19-69.04, range) and 65.78 (65.20-66.28) for 2 years OS and LFS, respectively.Conclusions: The UCBT score is a simple tool for risk stratification of AL patients undergoing UCBT. Widespread application of the score will require further independent validation. Clin Cancer Res; 23(21); 6478-86. ©2017 AACR."
2005,16131567,KIR reconstitution is altered by T cells in the graft and correlates with clinical outcomes after unrelated donor transplantation.,"Although unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for many hematologic malignancies, complications and relapse remain challenging obstacles. Natural killer (NK) cells, which recover quickly after transplantation, produce cytokines and express killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that regulate their cytotoxicity. Some clinical trials based on a KIR ligand mismatch strategy are associated with less relapse and increased survival, but results are mixed. We hypothesized that T cells in the graft may affect NK cell function and KIR expression after unrelated transplantation and that these differences correlate with clinical outcomes. NK cell function was evaluated using 77 paired samples from the National Marrow Donor Program Research Repository. Recipient NK cells at 100 days after both unmanipulated bone marrow (UBM) and T-cell depleted (TCD) transplants were compared with NK cells from their healthy donors. NK cells expressed fewer KIRs and produced more interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) after UBM compared to TCD transplants. Multivariate models showed that increased NK cell IFN-gamma production correlated with more acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and decreased KIR expression correlated with inferior survival. These results support the notion that T cells in the graft affect NK cell reconstitution in vivo. Understanding these mechanisms may result in strategies to improve clinical outcomes from unrelated HCT."
2017,28530668,Radioimmunotherapy-augmented BEAM chemotherapy vs BEAM alone as the high-dose regimen for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL): a retrospective study of the EBMT Lymphoma Working Party.,"Relapse remains the most common cause of treatment failure in patients receiving autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for follicular lymphoma (FL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding radioimmunotherapy or rituximab (R) to BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, ara-c, melphalan) high-dose therapy for ASCT in patients with relapsed FL. Using the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, we conducted a cohort comparison of BEAM (n=1973), Zevalin-BEAM (Z-BEAM) (n=207) and R-BEAM (n=179) and also a matched-cohort analysis of BEAM vs Z-BEAM including 282 and 154 patients, respectively. BEAM, Z-BEAM and R-BEAM groups were well balanced for age, time from diagnosis to ASCT and disease status at ASCT. The cumulative incidences of relapse (IR) at 2 years were 34, 34 and 32% for Z-BEAM, R-BEAM and BEAM, respectively. By multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences with Z-BEAM or R-BEAM compared with BEAM for IR, non-relapse mortality, event-free survival or overall survival. With the caveat that the limitations of registry analyses have to be taken into account, this study does not support adding radioimmunotherapy or R to BEAM in ASCT for relapsed FL. However, we cannot rule out the existence a particular subset of patients who could benefit from Z-BEAM conditioning that cannot be identified in our series, and this should be tested in a randomized trial."
2016,27599802,A dietary strategy for the management of artemether-lumefantrine-induced cardiovascular and renal toxicity.,"Unsweetened natural cocoa has antimalarial properties. Unsweetened natural cocoa powder (UNCP), obtained as a result of the removal of cocoa butter from a cocoa bean protects against malaria episodes. Cocoa powder, which is prepared after removal of the cocoa butter, contains about 1.9 % theobromine and 0.21 % caffeine. Concomitant consumption of cocoa and artemether/lumefantrine (A/L) is a common practice in Ghana, West Africa. This study seeks to determine the elemental composition of UNCP and its protective effect on the heart and kidney against (A/L) administration.Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used to detect the quality and quantity of the elemental composition in UNCP. Thereafter, 30 nonmalarious male guinea pigs were divided into five groups of six animals each. One group was administered with 75 mg/kg body weight A/L only and another group distilled water (control group). The rest received 300 mg/kg, 900 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg body weight UNCP for 14 days orally and A/L for the last 3 days (ie day 11 to day 14). Biochemical and histopathological examinations were carried out after euthanisation of the animals.A total of thirty-eight (38) micro and macro elements were detected with the ED-XRF. Macro elements like sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) and micro elements like chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb) were identified and evaluated. Biochemical analysis revealed increases in HDL levels (p>0.05) while there were decreases in LDL levels (p>0.05), creatine kinase and AST levels (P<0.05) in animals that received UNCP compared to A/L only administered group. Urea levels reduced significantly by 53 % (p<0.05) in group that received 1500 mg/kg UNCP. Histopathological examinations of the heart and kidney buttressed the protective effects of cocoa administration.The percentage of recommended daily allowance of UNCP for chromium is 3750 % for men and 5250 % for women while % RDA for copper corresponds to 103.6 % in both sexes. UNCP proved to possess cardioprotective and renoprotective potential during artemether-lumefantrine administration."
2001,11157348,Probiotics: determinants of survival and growth in the gut.,"Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are purportedly beneficial to human health and are called probiotics. Their survival during passage through the human gut, when administered in fermented milk products, has been investigated intensely in recent years. Well-controlled, small-scale studies on diarrhea in both adults and infants have shown that probiotics are beneficial and that they survive in sufficient numbers to affect gut microbial metabolism. Survival rates have been estimated at 20-40% for selected strains, the main obstacles to survival being gastric acidity and the action of bile salts. Although it is believed that the maximum probiotic effect can be achieved if the organisms adhere to intestinal mucosal cells, there is no evidence that exogenously administered probiotics do adhere to the mucosal cells. Instead, they seem to pass into the feces without having adhered or multiplied. Thus, to obtain a continuous exogenous probiotic effect, the probiotic culture must be ingested continually. Certain exogenously administered substances enhance the action of both exogenous and endogenous probiotics. Human milk contains many substances that stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria in vitro and also in the small intestine of infants; however, it is unlikely that they function in the colon. However, lactulose and certain fructose-containing compounds, called prebiotics, are not digested in the small intestine but pass into the cecum unchanged, where they are selectively utilized by probiotics. Beneficial effects may thus accrue from exogenously administered probiotics, often administered with prebiotics, or by endogenous bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, whose metabolic activity and growth may also be enhanced by the administration of prebiotics."
2018,29699658,Two types of phenoloxidases contribute to hemolymph PO activity in spiny Lobster.,"Phenoloxidases (POs) play a crucial role in melanization of crustaceans. There are at least two types of POs characterized in crustaceans: the conventional type (POα here) that is expressed in hemocytes and POβ, a secreted protein synthesized in the hepatopancreas. We investigated the source of PO activity in the hemolymph of a lobster and determined the kinetic parameters of mono- and di-PO activities. In the lobster hemolymph, POα, which formed a hexamer similar to both POβ and hemocyanin, contributed to PO activity, whereas the amount of POβ was low. Kinetic analyses using purified prophenoloxidase of crustaceans showed that lobster POα has a higher rate constant, while shrimp POβ has higher specificity in both mono- and di-PO reactions, when tyramine and dopamine were employed as substrates. There should be at least two types of PO molecules in crustacean hemolymph, but the dominant PO molecule type varies among species."
2019,30784905,Allium tuberosum alleviates diabetic nephropathy by supressing hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inﬂammation in high fat diet/streptozotocin treated rats.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the butanol fraction from Allium tuberosum (BFAT) in high fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) induced diabetic nephropathy. Wistar rats were fed with HFD for 4 weeks and thereafter administered with 35 mg/kg STZ intraperitoneally. Diabetic rats were treated with BFAT (100 or 400 mg/kg) and metformin (150 mg/kg) for 40 days. After treatment, the blood, urine and kidney tissues were obtained for biochemical and histological analysis. BFAT markedly decreased blood glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinary albumin levels in diabetic rats. Furthermore, BFAT upregulated renal antioxidant enzymes status (glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase) and decreased lipid peroxidation product in diabetic rats as well as reduced the levels of renal pro-inflammatory cytokines in diabetic rats. In addition, BFAT significantly decreased serum and renal levels of triglyceride and cholesterol in the treated diabetic rats. These results revealed that A. tuberosum possesses attenuative effects against diabetic nephropathy."
1994,8191013,Immunosuppression in sheep experimentally infected with Ehrlichia phagocytophila.,"The effect of tick-borne fever (TBF) on antibody formation and lymphocyte proliferation in sheep was studied following experimental infection with Ehrlichia phagocytophila. All infected sheep developed fever within three to four days. The sheep recovered clinically within eight days. Both infected and non-infected control sheep were immunised twice with different antigens, that is, on days 9 and 35 following the experimental infection. The levels of antibodies produced against tetanus toxoid and influenza virus in the infected sheep were significantly lower than in the control animals. The findings indicated that a TBF-infection may impair both primary and secondary antibody responses for up to six weeks. Immunisation with Actinomyces pyogenes resulted in significantly higher antibody titres in the TBF-infected group than in the control group, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It is believed that TBF-induced neutropenia may lead to increased exposure to A pyogenes-antigens and thereby enhance antibody production. Antibodies to E phagocytophila were measured by the indirect fluorescent antibody test and by an ELISA. The inoculated sheep responded with the formation of antibodies to E phagocytophila at one week (P < 0.025), and showed a peak response at four weeks (P < 0.0005) after inoculation. The antibody titre decreased between four and six weeks, but was still high at six weeks (P < 0.0005). The lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) were lower than in the control group and this difference was significant at most time points after infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2008,18175899,"Purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a Bowman-Birk type trypsin inhibitor from Apios americana Medikus tubers.","An Apios americana trypsin inhibitor, AATI, was purified from Apios tubers by chromatography on DEAE Cellulofine A-500 and Sephadex G-50. The molecular mass of AATI was determined to be 6,437 Da by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS). It showed strong inhibitory activity toward serine proteases, and the inhibition constants toward trypsin and chymotrypsin were 3.0 x 10(-9) M and 1.0 x 10(-6) M respectively. The inhibitory activity was not affected by heating at 80 degrees C for 2 h or by incubation at a wide range of pH values, suggesting that AATI has remarkable heat-stability and pH-stability. AATI cDNA consists of 552 nucleotides, and includes an open reading frame encoding a protein of 116 amino acids. The results of N-terminal amino acid sequencing of AATI and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis suggested that the deduced amino acid sequence had 50 and seven extra amino acids at the N- and C-termini respectively. Thus the mature AATI protein consists of 59 amino acid residues. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of the trypsin inhibitors from plants suggests that AATI belongs to the Bowman-Birk family and that it contains two possible reactive sites toward trypsin at Lys62 and Arg88."
2018,30273101,"Effects of Epigallocatechin Gallate on Behavioral and Cognitive Impairments, Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Dysfunction, and Alternations in Hippocampal BDNF Expression Under Single Prolonged Stress.","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a traumatic stress-related psychiatric disorder stimulated by experience. Green tea has potent antioxidative properties, due, in part, to the catechin (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). EGCG is an important polyphenol with advantageous effects on anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the mechanism about the inhibition of PTSD-like symptoms of EGCG is still unidentified. We examined whether EGCG improved learning and memory deficit stimulated in rats after single prolonged stress (SPS). Rats were administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with EGCG for 14 successive days after the SPS process. The SPS procedure stimulated cognitive deficit in the Morris water maze test and the object recognition task, and this impairment was improved by EGCG (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Daily EGCG administration significantly decreased the freezing response to contextual fear conditioning. The administration of EGCG also significantly moderated memory-related decreases in the alternation of cAMP-response element-binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that EGCG alleviated SPS-stimulated learning and memory deficit by inhibiting the increase of neuroinflammation in the rat brain. In addition, EGCG reversed the alternation of allopregnanolone and progesterone in the brain, and diminished simultaneously the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. Thus, EGCG reversed learning and memory-related behavioral dysfunction and molecular alternation accelerated by traumatic stress and may be a useful therapeutic material for PTSD."
2014,23336810,Optimization of a surfactant-free antioxidant formulation using response surface methodology.,"Topical application of natural antioxidants has proven to be effective in protecting the skin against ultraviolet radiation-mediated oxidative damage. In previous studies, a Castanea sativa leaf ethanol:water (7:3) extract exhibited scavenging activity against different reactive oxygen species that are thought to contribute to oxidative damage in the skin. Its stability was shown to be enhanced in the presence of glycerine, and therefore a glycerine-based formulation with Carbopol 940 and liquid paraffin (LP) was developed as base. In this work, the influence of the glycerine and LP contents on the textural properties of the topical base and on the antioxidant activity of the formulation with C. sativa extract was evaluated using response surface methodology after 30 d storage at 20 °C and 40 °C. The textural analysis was performed in a texturometer, by carrying out a spreadability test. Paretto charts showed that both glycerine and LP contents significantly influenced the textural properties of the formulations (p < 0.05). LP presented the major influence. DPPH scavenging activity was not related to any of the studied ingredients. These conclusions were valid both for 20 °C and 40 °C storage. This optimization study provided valuable information to support the development of a semisolid base for C. sativa extract leading to the conclusion that the selection of these ingredients contents can be guided exclusively by the desirable textural properties."
2005,15684481,Effects of chronic administration of fruit extract (Citrus unshiu Marc) on endothelial dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.,"We investigated the effects of chronic administration of fruit extract (Citrus unshiu MARC) on the endothelial dysfunction seen in aortae from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. A ten-week administration of this fruit extract preserved acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, but not sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation, in the diabetic aorta. In age-matched control rats, chronic administration of the fruit extract had no influence on the ACh- or SNP-induced aortic relaxation. The increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels seen in STZ-induced diabetic rats were not normalized by fruit-extract treatment. These results suggest that Citrus unshiu MARC extract preserves endothelial function in the aorta in STZ-induced diabetic rats without lowering plasma cholesterol. This beneficial effect may be due to this extract protecting of nitric oxide against inactivation by oxygen free radicals."
2005,15765114,Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for autoimmune diseases.,"Experimental data and early phase I/II studies suggest that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can arrest progression of severe autoimmune diseases. We have evaluated the toxicity and disease response in 473 patients with severe autoimmune disease treated with autologous HSCT between 1995 and 2003, from 110 centers participating in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) autoimmune disease working party database. Survival, transplant-related mortality, treatment response and disease progression were assessed. In all, 420 patients (89%; 86+/-4% at 3 years, median follow-up 20 months) were alive, 53 (11%) had died from transplant-related mortality (N=31; 7+/-3% at 3 years) or disease progression (N=22; 9+/-4% at 3 years). Of 370 patients, 299 evaluable for response (81%) showed a treatment response, which was sustained in 213 (71% of responders). Response was associated with disease (P<0.001), was better in patients who received cyclophosphamide during mobilization (relative risk (RR)3.28 (1.57-6.83)) and was worse with increasing age (>40 years, RR0.29 (0.11-0.82)). Disease progression was associated with disease (P<0.001) and conditioning intensity (high intensity, RR1; intermediate intensity, RR1.81 (0.96-3.42)); low intensity, RR2.34 (1.074-5.11)). These data from the collective EBMT experience support the hypothesis that autologous HSCT can alter disease progression in severe autoimmune disease."
2018,30802215,"Anti-asthmatic effects of volatile organic compounds from Chamaecyparis obtusa, Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, or Larix kaempferi wood panels.","Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease in which lung airways narrow and produce extra mucus. Numerous medications, such as steroids, are used to prevent or control asthmatic symptoms, but side effects are associated with those medications. There are reports of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiparasitic effects of terpene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) in conifers. VOCs easily enter a gaseous form, and wood products are good sources of VOCs. However, only a few studies have been conducted on the effect on asthma of VOCs emitted by wood. In this study, we examined the effects of VOCs diffused from wood panels on ovoalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma in a mouse model. The mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with 10 μg of OVA with aluminum hydroxide on days 0, 7, and 14. From day 21 to day 26, the mice were challenged with 2% OVA intranasally for 30 min. For VOC treatment, asthma model mice were placed in polyacrylamide chambers containing wood panels of Chamaecyparis obtusa, Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, or Larix kaempferi. On day 27, serum, lung tissue, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were prepared for H&E staining, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and Diff-Quik staining, as appropriate. OVA treatment induced hypertrophy of the bronchiolar wall. The budesonide group and all four of the wood panel-exposed groups showed less thickening of the bronchiolar wall and downregulated transcriptional expressions of cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). The serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression level was significantly decreased only in the C. obtusa group, but the serum IL-4 levels were decreased in all wood panel treatment groups. Diff-Quik staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids revealed a decrease in the number of granulocytes in all wood panel treatment groups. The results suggest that VOCs from C. obtusa, P. densiflora, P. koraiensis and L. kaempferi produce antiasthmatic effects by regulating the production of IL-4, IL-9, IL-13, TNF-α."
1998,9503097,Modifications of allergenicity linked to food technologies.,"The prevalence of food allergies (FA) has increased over the past fifteen years. The reasons suggested are changes in dietary behaviour and the evolution of food technologies. New cases of FA have been described with chayote, rambutan, arguta, pumpkin seeds, custard apple, and with mycoproteins from Fusarium.... Additives using food proteins are at high risk: caseinates, lysozyme, cochineal red, papaïn, alpha-amylase, lactase etc. Heating can reduce allergenicity or create neo-allergens, as well as storage, inducing the synthesis of allergenic stress or PR proteins. Aeroallergens (miles, moulds) contaminate foods and can induce allergic reactions. Involuntary contamination by peanut proteins on production lines is a problem which is not yet solved. Genetically modified plants are at risk of allergenicity, requiring methodological steps of investigations: the comparison of the amino-acid sequence of the transferred protein with the sequence of known allergens, the evaluation of thermo degradability and of the denaturation by pepsin and trypsin are required, as well as the study with sera from patients allergic to the plant producing the gene. The combination of enzymatic hydrolysis, heating, or the development of genetically modified plants may offer new alternatives towards hypoallergenic foods (57 references)."
2019,31074673,Preventive Effect of an Infusion of the Aqueous Extract of Chaya Leaves (Cnidoscolus aconitifolius) in an Aberrant Crypt Foci Rat Model Induced by Azoxymethane and Dextran Sulfate Sodium.,"Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) is the precursor lesion of colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC), one of the most common malignancies in the world. Many studies have reported that people with higher phytochemical intake are at a reduced risk of developing ACF. One example of the botanical potential of preventive plant products is Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (CA), commonly known as Chaya. This study evaluated the phenolic profile of CA and the effects of the daily consumption of CA leaf infusion on the formation of ACF, histopathological lesions, and molecular biomarkers after azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced premalignant colon lesions in rats treated with for 16 and 32 weeks. The phenolic composition of the CA infusion was identified by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (RP-HPCC-DAD). After sacrifice, a 4 cm segment was collected from the distal part of the colon and stained with methylene blue to look for ACF. Furthermore, 4 μm of colon, liver, and kidney was collected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analysis, along with 7 μm of colon for immunohistochemistry analysis. Eleven phenolic compounds were identified in the infusions, and ACF formation was reduced by 29.5% at the subchronic and by 64.6% at chronic stages. Lesions on kidney, liver, and colon tissue were also reduced. Our data suggest that CA treatment has preventive effects against AOM-/DSS-induced premalignant colon lesions in colon rats at the promotion level, inhibiting the cell proliferation of early neoplastic lesions and colonic inflammation through the decrease of β-catenin by 41.8% at the subchronic stage and 29% at the chronic stage, along with a 46.2% reduction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) at long term, despite a high expression of NF-κB (30.3% at the subchronic stage and 22.8% at the chronic stage)."
2001,11722432,Differentiation and expansion of endothelial cells from human bone marrow CD133(+) cells.,"We report a method of purifying, characterizing and expanding endothelial cells (ECs) derived from CD133(+) bone marrow cells, a subset of CD34(+) haematopoietic progenitors. Isolated using immunomagnetic sorting (mean purity 90 +/- 5%), the CD133(+) bone marrow cells were grown on fibronectin-coated flasks in M199 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and insulin growth factor (IGF-1). The CD133(+) fraction contained 95 +/- 4% CD34(+) cells, 3 +/- 2% cells expressing VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/KDR), but did not express von Willebrand factor (VWF), VE-cadherin, P1H12 or TE-7. After 3 weeks of culture, the cells formed a monolayer with a typical EC morphology and expanded 11 +/- 5 times. The cells were further purified using Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-FITC microbeads, and expanded with VEGF for a further 3 weeks. All of the cells were CD45(-) and CD14(-), and expressed several endothelial markers (UEA-1, VWF, P1H12, CD105, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and VE-cadherin) and typical Weibel-Palade bodies. They had a high proliferative potential (up to a 2400-fold increase in cell number after 3 weeks of culture) and the capacity to modulate cell surface antigens upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. Purified ECs were also co-cultivated with CD34(+) cells, in parallel with a purified fibroblastic cell monolayer. CD34(+) cells (10 x 10(5)) gave rise to 17,951 +/- 2422 CFU-GM colonies when grown on endothelial cells, and to 12,928 +/- 4415 CFU-GM colonies on fibroblast monolayers. The ECs also supported erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-E) colonies better. These results suggest that bone marrow CD133(+) progenitor cells can give rise to highly purified ECs, which have a high proliferative capacity, can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and are superior to fibroblasts in supporting haematopoiesis. Our data support the hypothesis that endothelial cell progenitors are present in adult bone marrow and may contribute to neo-angiogenesis."
2013,23411330,Effect of ferrous sulfate fortification in germinated brown rice on seed iron concentration and bioavailability.,"The present study evaluated the effectiveness of germination and iron fortification on iron concentration and bioavailability of brown rice. Iron fortification during germination process with 0.05-2 g/L ferrous sulfate increased the iron concentration in germinated brown rice from 1.1 to 15.6 times than those in raw brown rice. Based on the recommended dietary allowance of iron, maximum germination rate and γ-aminobutyric acid, we recommend the brown rice fortified with 0.25 g/L FeSO(4) as a suitable fortification level to use in germination process. Iron fortification during the germination process has a positive effect on iron concentration and bioavailability. A significant difference was observed among the cultivars in respect to the capacity for iron accumulation and bioavailability. Germination alone could improve in vitro iron solubility, but had no effect on iron bioavailability in Caco-2 cell, the additional fortification process should be combined to get high amount of bioavailable iron from the brown rice."
2001,11181419,"Black tea extract, thearubigin fraction, counteract the effects of botulinum neurotoxins in mice.","Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A, 1.5 nM) completely inhibited indirectly evoked twitches in in vitro mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations within 40 - 45 min. Black tea extract, thearubigin fraction (TRB), mixed with BoNT/A blocked the inhibitory effect of the toxin. The protective effect of TRB extended to botulinum neurotoxins types B and E (BoNT/B and BoNT/E) and tetanus toxin, but not to tetrodotoxin. TRB was also effective against oral toxicity of BoNT/A, B and E. Thus, TRB may be of potential benefit in protecting the paralytic actions of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), but its use is limited by mixing with the toxin."
2005,16351781,"Dietary fibre-rich oat-based products affect serum lipids, microbiota, formation of short-chain fatty acids and steroids in rats.","Wistar rats (ten per group) were fed either an oat-free control diet or a dietary fibre-rich test diet containing 500 g oat-based products/kg for 6 weeks. The oat-based products, containing 4-128 g/kg resistant starch, 30-92 g/kg beta-glucan and 122-304 g/kg total dietary fibre, were oat flour extrudate, flour/Novelose (commercial resistant starch) extrudate (80:20 w/w), oat bran, bran/Novelose extrudate (80:20 w/w) and autoclaved oat flour. Serum total cholesterol decreased in the groups fed flour, flour/Novelose and bran/Novelose (P<0.05). In most of the test groups, count numbers of bifidobacteria were higher (P<0.001) and of coliforms were lower (P<0.05). The mass of the caecum walls and contents was greater in groups fed Novelose- and bran-containing diets (P<0.005). In all the test groups, pH values were lower in the intestinal contents (P<0.001), and caecal concentrations of acetate (P<0.001), propionate (P<0.05), butyrate (P<0.005) and total SCFA (P<0.001) were higher. The lowest concentrations of steroids were found in rats fed the autoclaved flour. In the other test groups, more bile acids appeared in the caecal (P<0.001) and colonic contents (P<0.005), as well as in the faeces, at week 6 (P<0.001). The highest bile acid excretion was found after feeding bran-containing diets. In the intestinal contents of all the test groups, more primary bile acids (P<0.001) appeared than in the control group. The excretion of steroids increased within the experimental period. Using extrusion technology, dietary fibre-rich oat-based products, which have beneficial physiological effects in rats, can be produced. Oat flour and bran are excellent sources for the preparation of directly edible oat products. Their nutritional properties can be further improved by the addition of resistant starch."
2009,19100718,Long-term resveratrol administration reduces metabolic disturbances and lowers blood pressure in obese Zucker rats.,"Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic stilbene derivative found in several human diet components that possess important and wide-ranging effects in biological systems including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cardio-protective, and anti-ageing actions and beneficial properties against metabolic diseases. This study addresses the effects of long-term administration of resveratrol on several functional alterations arising from the metabolic syndrome experimental model of obese Zucker rats, and the possible mechanisms involved. The high plasma concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, insulin and leptin found in obese Zucker rats were reduced in obese rats that received resveratrol. Furthermore, the elevated hepatic lipid content was significantly lower in obese rats treated with resveratrol, an effect which was related to the increased phosphorylation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in the liver of these animals. Resveratrol treatment also improved the inflammatory status peculiar to this model, as it increased the concentration of adiponectin and lowered tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese Zucker rats. Moreover, chronic intake of resveratrol enhanced VAT eNOS expression among obese Zucker rats. These effects parallel the activation of AMPK and inhibition by phosphorylation of ACC in this tissue. The raised systolic blood pressure and reduced aortic eNOS expression found in obese Zucker rats were significantly improved in the resveratrol-treated obese rats. In conclusion, resveratrol improved dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and hypertension in obese Zucker rats, and produced anti-inflammatory effects in VAT, effects that seem to be mediated by AMPK activation."
2015,26134484,"Differential Effects of Glycyrrhiza Species on Genotoxic Estrogen Metabolism: Licochalcone A Downregulates P450 1B1, whereas Isoliquiritigenin Stimulates It.","Estrogen chemical carcinogenesis involves 4-hydroxylation of estrone/estradiol (E1/E2) by P450 1B1, generating catechol and quinone genotoxic metabolites that cause DNA mutations and initiate/promote breast cancer. Inflammation enhances this effect by upregulating P450 1B1. The present study tested the three authenticated medicinal species of licorice [Glycyrrhiza glabra (GG), G. uralensis (GU), and G. inflata (GI)] used by women as dietary supplements for their anti-inflammatory activities and their ability to modulate estrogen metabolism. The pure compounds, liquiritigenin (LigF), its chalcone isomer isoliquiritigenin (LigC), and the GI-specific licochalcone A (LicA) were also tested. The licorice extracts and compounds were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity by measuring inhibition of iNOS activity in macrophage cells: GI ≫ GG > GU and LigC ≅ LicA ≫ LigF. The Michael acceptor chalcone, LicA, is likely responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of GI. A sensitive LC-MS/MS assay was employed to quantify estrogen metabolism by measuring 2-MeOE1 as nontoxic and 4-MeOE1 as genotoxic biomarkers in the nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A. GG, GU, and LigC increased 4-MeOE1, whereas GI and LicA inhibited 2- and 4-MeOE1 levels. GG, GU (5 μg/mL), and LigC (1 μM) also enhanced P450 1B1 expression and activities, which was further increased by inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ). LicA (1, 10 μM) decreased cytokine- and TCDD-induced P450 1B1 gene expression and TCDD-induced xenobiotic response element luciferase reporter (IC50 = 12.3 μM), suggesting an antagonistic effect on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which regulates P450 1B1. Similarly, GI (5 μg/mL) reduced cytokine- and TCDD-induced P450 1B1 gene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that, of the three licorice species that are used in botanical supplements, GI represents the most promising chemopreventive licorice extract for women's health. Additionally, the differential effects of the Glycyrrhiza species on estrogen metabolism emphasize the importance of standardization of botanical supplements to species-specific bioactive compounds.

Each sample was subjected to an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) and analysis of the digesta by HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL was performed in order to obtain a comprehensive peptide profile of fermented donkey milk. Functional properties such as ACE-inhibitory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the resulting fermented donkey milks, as well as characterization of the bioactive peptides produced by an in vitro SGID, were assayed. All bioactivities were found to be high in fermented milk and a further significant increase was observed after SGID. The Enterococcus faecium DM33 fermented milk exhibited the strongest antioxidant and the highest antimicrobial activities. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was observed in milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei DM214. These findings will contribute to the development of a new functional dairy drink with anti-hypertensive, antimicrobial and/or antioxidant activities."

Newer biomedicine and pharmacotherapy has been investigated for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders in the past few decades. Spinacia oleracea is one of these, reported to have beneficial effect against several neurodegenerative disorders. The present study was carried to explore the protective effects of Spinacia oleracea seed extract (SOEE) in an experimental model of ketamine-induced schizophrenia in mice. Ketamine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to induce stereotyped psychotic behavioural symptoms in mice. Behavioral studies (locomotor activity, stereotype behaviors, immobility duration and memory retention) were carried out to investigate the protective of SOEE on ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms, followed by biochemical, neurochemical and cellular alterations in the brain. Treatment with SOEE for 15 consecutive days significantly attenuated stereotyped behavioral symptoms in mice. Biochemical estimations revealed that SOEE reduced lipid peroxidation and restored total brain proteins. Furthermore, SOEE remarkably reduced dopamine levels, AChE activity & inflammatory surge (serum TNF-α) and increased the levels of GABA and reduced glutathione in mice. The outcomes of the study suggested that SOEE could ameliorate ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in mice, indicating a protective effect in the treatment of schizophrenia."
2017,29197355,Extract of Ginkgo biloba exacerbates liver metastasis in a mouse colon cancer Xenograft model.,"Metastasis refers to the spread of a primary tumor cell from the primary site to other locations in the body and it is generally associated with the severity of a tumor. Extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) contains various bioactive compounds and it exerts beneficial effects including improvements in brain function and reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, increased risk of thyroid and liver cancers by EGb have been reported in animals.A colon cancer metastasis model was established using intrasplenic injection of a human colon cancer cell line, SW620-luc in athymic mice to investigate the potential impact of EGb on colon cancer progression. After tumor establishment, EGb was intraperitonically injected daily for 5 wks.EGb significantly increased the rate of metastasis in mouse liver and decreased the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells in the metastatic liver when compared to the control. Meanwhile, EGb significantly induced proliferation of tumor cells in the metastatic liver, indicated by increased staining of Ki67 and H3S10p. mRNA expression of genes involved in cell cycle, metastasis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were altered by EGb treatment in livers with tumors. Moreover, EGb activated the stress-responsive MAPK pathways in the liver with metastatic tumors.EGb exacerbated liver metastasis in a mouse colon cancer metastasis model. This is potentially due to the increased tumor cell proliferation involving stimulated MAPK pathways."
2010,19823776,Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek) protects against selenite-induced oxidative stress in experimental cataractogenesis.,"Cataract is the opacification in eye lens and leads to 50% of blindness worldwide. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anticataract potential of Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn seeds (fenugreek) in selenite-induced in vitro and in vivo cataract. In vitro enucleated rat lenses were maintained in organ culture containing Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) alone or in addition with 100 microM selenite and served as the normal and control groups, respectively. For the test group, the medium was supplemented with selenite and T. foenum-graecum aqueous extract. The lenses were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. After incubation, the lenses were processed for the estimation of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation product (malondialdehyde), and the antioxidant enzymes. In vivo selenite cataract was induced in 9-day-old rats by subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite (25 micromol/kg body weight). Animals in the test group were injected with different doses of aqueous extract of T. foenum-graecum 4 h before the selenite challenge. A fall in GSH and a rise in malondialdehyde levels were observed in control as compared to normal lenses. T. foenum-graecum significantly (P < 0.01) restored glutathione and decreased malondialdehyde levels. A significant restoration in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), catalase, (P < 0.01), glutathione peroxidase (P < 0.01), and glutathione-S-transferase (P < 0.01) was observed in the T. foenum-graecum supplemented group as compared to control. In vivo, none of the eyes was found with nuclear cataract in treated group as opposed to 72.5% in the control group. T. foenum-graecum protects against experimental cataract by virtue of its antioxidant properties. Further studies are warranted to explore its role in human cataract."
2016,26891551,Potential of Vigna radiata (L.) sprouts in the management of inflammation and arthritis in rats: Possible biochemical alterations.,"Vigna radiata (Fabaceae) is an important pulse crop widespread throughout the tropics and warm temperature regions. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro anti-inflammatory and in vivo antiarthritic activity of Vigna radiata sprouts in rats. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was determined by membrane stabilization and protein denaturation method. Whereas, the antiarthritic activity of the ethanolic extract of the sprouts was evaluated by complete Freund's adjuvant model with diclofenac sodium as the standard drug. Body weights, paw volume, biochemical parameters such as lipid peroxidation, total reduced glutathione, myeloperoxidase and lysosomal enzymes like cathepsin-D, N-acetyl β-D-glucosamindase and β-D-glucuronidase were estimated. Treatment with ethanolic extract of V. radiata exhibited significant membrane stabilization activity and protein denaturation activity, and significantly attenuated the biochemical changes induced by administration of complete Freund's adjuvant. The findings of the present study suggest the possible role of Vigna radiata in the therapeutics of arthritis."
1986,3520699,Isolation and structures of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) glucagon and glucagon-like peptide.,"Glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP) containing 31 amino acids have been isolated from the principal islet of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by gel filtration of acid alcohol extracts followed by HPLC, and the complete amino acid sequence of both peptides has been determined. Salmon glucagon is a simple 29 residue peptide differing at 3 positions when compared to catfish glucagon and at 8 positions when compared to porcine glucagon. Salmon GLP differs at 6 positions when compared with the N-terminal 31 amino acids of the 34 amino acid catfish GLP. Both coho salmon glucagon and GLP cross-react weakly in our mammalian glucagon radioimmunoassay and therefore this technique could not be used to determine tissue content. Glucagon and GLP isolated amounted to 156 micrograms/g and 350 micrograms/g wet tissue, respectively."
2000,10759719,Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and transplantation after fludarabine therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): a report of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) CLL subcommittee on behalf of the EBMT Chronic Leukaemias Working Party (CLWP).,"We performed a survey from 122 centres of the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) concerning peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization after fludarabine treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). A total of 101 leucaphereses from 29 patients was performed. The median cell numbers collected were: CD34+ cells, 2.2 x 106/kg (0.1-15.3); granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU), 4.29 x 104/kg (0.4-177); and mononuclear cells, 6.4 x 108/kg (1.3-63). In univariate and multivariate analyses, the numbers of cells collected were not significantly influenced by the nature of mobilizing regimen and there was a trend towards the collection of a higher number of CD34+ cells from patients who received fludarabine only before mobilization. There was a significant correlation between the median number of CD34+ cells collected and the number of courses of fludarabine (higher CD34+ cell numbers were related to more than six courses) and the interval between the last dose of fludarabine and the start of mobilizing therapy (higher CD34+ cell numbers were related to a delay > or = 2 months). Sixteen patients have subsequently undergone autologous transplantation and showed rapid engraftment. In conclusion, the results reported favour early stem cell mobilization in CLL patients who are in remission after first-line therapy. However, attention should be given to the timing of mobilization with respect to the time since the last dose of fludarabine."
2007,17322161,Interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin.,"The interaction potential between warfarin and cranberry juice is discussed.Reports from the United Kingdom have raised concern over the interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin. Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral medication for anticoagulation therapy. Cranberry juice is a flavonoid, which has been shown to induce, inhibit, or act as a substrate for the biosynthesis of several cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Specifically, cranberry juice may inhibit the activity of CYP2C9, the primary isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of S-warfarin. A search of the medical literature identified three peer-reviewed case reports and two peer-reviewed, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials using metabolic surrogates of warfarin (flurbiprofen and cyclosporine) that described possible interactions between cranberry juice and warfarin. Two case reports suggested that cranberry juice increased the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of patients taking warfarin, but neither clearly identified cranberry juice as the sole cause of INR elevation. One case report appeared to show a correlation between the effects of cranberry juice and warfarin metabolism. Both clinical trials indicated the lack of an interaction between cranberry juice and CYP isoenzymes 2C9 and 3A, both of which are necessary in warfarin metabolism. More studies are required to determine the potential interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin.The available data do not seem to show a clinically relevant interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin; however, patients taking warfarin with cranberry juice should be cautioned about the potential interaction and monitored closely for INR changes and signs and symptoms of bleeding."
2010,20191353,Anticoagulating activities of low-molecular weight fuco-oligosaccharides prepared by enzymatic digestion of fucoidan from the sporophyll of Korean Undaria pinnatifida.,"In spite of their potential as biologically active compounds, the high molecular mass and viscous natures of fucoidans have hampered their applications especially as a therapeutic agent. Herein the fucoidan-degrading enzyme activities were partially purified from the cultured cells of Sphingomonas paucimobilis PF-1 mainly by ammonium sulfate precipitation. This enzyme preparation degraded fucoidans from the Korean Undaria pinnatifida sporophyll into several low-molecular weight fuco-oligosaccharides (LMFOs) with less than 3,749 Da. The FTIR spectra of intact fucoidan and mixture of LMFOs (1,389-3,749 Da) showed no significant structural difference except for about 10% reduced level of sulfate esters in LMFOs. The LMFOs have exerted strong anticoagulating activities at which the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT) were significantly prolonged, although 3 approximately 20 times weaker activities were observed than those of intact fucoidan. In addition, unlike intact fucoidan, LMFOs did not affect significantly to the prothrombin time (PT). These results suggest that the partially purified fucoidan-degrading enzyme preparation is valuable for the production of fuco-oligosaccharides having anticoagulating activities, and that the molecular weight and/or sulfate content of the fucoidan from the Korean Undaria pinnatifida sporophyll could be important factors for its anticoagulating activity."
2015,26606646,Evaluation of different smoking habits during music festivals through wastewater analysis.,"Wastewater analysis is a powerful method that can provide useful information about the abuse of legal and illicit drugs. The aim of our study was to determine nicotine consumption during four different music festivals and to find a connection between smoking and preferences for specific music styles using wastewater analysis. The amount of the nicotine metabolite cotinine was monitored in wastewater at the influent of three waste water treatment plants WWTPs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where the festivals took place. Urinary bio-markers of nicotine utilization were analyzed by LC-HRMS. More than 80,000 festival participants were monitored during our study from June to September 2014. A significant increase of nicotine consumption was observed in wastewaters during music festivals. The nicotine ingestion level was back-calculated and expressed as mass of pure drug consumed per day and per 1000 inhabitants for selected cities of both countries. The highest differences between typical levels of cotinine in wastewaters and the levels during music festivals were detected in Piešťany: 4 g/L/1000 inhabitants during non-festival days compared to 8 g/L/1000 inhabitants during the Topfest pop-rock festival and 6g/L/1000 inhabitants during the Grape dance festival. No significant increase of the amounts of cotinine in wastewater was recorded for the Country and Folk festivals."
2015,25861937,The therapeutic potential of berberine against the altered intrinsic properties of the CA1 neurons induced by Aβ neurotoxicity.,"It was demonstrated that treatment with beta amyloid (Aβ) led to extreme alterations in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Also, malfunction of the cholinergic system is correlated to the memory and cognitive impairments. Several new studies have suggested that Berberis vulgaris can act as a cholinesterase inhibitor. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine (BER) on the Aβ-induced impairments in learning and memory. The male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups of Sham, BER, Aβ and Aβ+BER. The administration of BER or its vehicle started immediately after the injection of Aβ and followed by 13 days. Then, the animals were tested for learning and memory performance using the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance tests. Then, they were sacrificed for the whole cell patch clamp recording. The results of the MWM and passive avoidance tasks indicated that administration of the BER in the Aβ+BER group prevented the memory impairment induced by Aβ. The results of the whole cell patch clamp also showed that administration of the BER restored the Aβ-induced impairments in the firing frequency, half-width and rebound action potential. These results suggested that administration of the BER could ameliorate neurotoxicity induced by Aβ. However, this neuroprotection impact could be resulted from the balance effect of the Ca(2+) entry. The optimal level of Ca(2+) entry by BER could be a major factor that modified the function of the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels and decreased the half-width in the Aβ treated rats. "
2005,16225653,Activity and safety of combined rituximab with chlorambucil in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.,"We evaluated the combination of rituximab with chlorambucil in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) not eligible for aggressive therapy. Fourteen patients (male/female: 9/5) were included (two newly diagnosed, 12 relapsed/refractory). The toxicities were neutropenia, thrombopenia and infection. Nine (64%) patients responded; five (36%) achieved complete remission and four (29%) achieved partial remission. The median progression-free survival for responders was 26 months (95% CI, 4-48). Marrow polymerase chain reaction negativity was attained in seven responders. These results suggest that this schedule may have notable antitumour activity in patients with MCL, including patients in relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation."
2003,12568354,Effects of ginsenosides on GABA(A) receptor channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes.,"Ginsenosides, major active ingredients of Panax ginseng, are known to regulate excitatory ligand-gated ion channel activity such as nicotinic acetylcholine and NMDA receptor channel activity. However, it is not known whether ginsenosides affect inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel activity. We investigated the effect of ginsenosides on human recombinant GABA(A) receptor (alpha1beta1gamma2S) channel activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Among the eight individual ginsenosides examined, namely, Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, Rg1 and Rg2, we found that Rc most potently enhanced the GABA-induced inward peak current (I(GABA)). Ginsenoside Rc alone induced an inward membrane current in certain batches of oocytes expressing the GABA(A) receptor. The effect of ginsenoside Rc on I(GABA) was both dose-dependent and reversible. The half-stimulatory concentration (EC50) of ginsenoside Rc was 53.2 +/- 12.3 microM. Both bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, and picrotoxin, a GABA(A) channel blocker, blocked the stimulatory effect of ginsenoside Rc on I(GABA). Niflumic acid (NFA) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), both Cl- channel blockers, attenuated the effect of ginsenoside Rc on I(GABA). This study suggests that ginsenosides regulated GABA(A) receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes and implies that this regulation might be one of the pharmacological actions of Panax ginseng."
2018,30029095,Electron shuttles enhance the degradation of sulfamethoxazole coupled with Fe(III) reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.,"The ability of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) and riboflavin to enhance the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation coupled with the Fe(III) reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was investigated. The results indicated that the SMX degradation rate was 38.5% with an initial SMX concentration at 0.04 mM. For the overall performance of AQDS and riboflavin mediated SMX degradation and iron reduction, the SMX degradation rate was gradually increased with the enhancement of iron reduction. Riboflavin had a stronger enhancement on SMX degradation and iron reduction than AQDS, but the enhancement was not positively correlated with electron shuttles concentration. A quantitative characterization of the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of the electron shuttles showed that the ETC was higher for riboflavin than AQDS. The S. oneidensis MR-1 16S rRNA gene copies results indicated that electron shuttles had a positive effect on the microbial activity of S. oneidensis MR-1. The LCMS result indicated that the products of the SMX biodegradation were 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which suggested that the SMX biodegradation was caused by SN bond cleavage. This study indicates that the biochemical mechanisms play a vital role in SMX transformation and Fe(II) generation in this system."
2005,16025143,Mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of the natural secosteroids physalins in a model of intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion injury.,"Reperfusion of an ischaemic tissue is associated with an intense inflammatory response and inflammation-mediated tissue injury. Physalins, a group of substances with secosteroidal chemical structure, are found in Physalis angulata stems and leaves. Here, we assessed the effects of physalins on the local, remote and systemic injuries following intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R) in mice and compared with the effects of dexamethasone. Following I/R injury, dexamethasone (10 mg kg(-1)) or physalin B or F markedly prevented neutrophil influx, the increase in vascular permeability in the intestine and the lungs. Maximal inhibition occurred at 20 mg kg(-1). Moreover, there was prevention of haemorrhage in the intestine of reperfused animals. Dexamethasone or physalins effectively suppressed the increase in tissue (intestine and lungs) and serum concentrations of TNF-alpha. Interestingly, treatment with the compounds was associated with enhancement of IL-10. The anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone or physalins were reversed by pretreatment with the corticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (25 mg kg(-1)). The drug compounds suppressed steady-state concentrations of corticosterone, but did not alter the reperfusion-associated increase in levels of corticosterone. The IL-10-enhancing effects of the drugs were not altered by RU486. In conclusion, the in vivo anti-inflammatory actions of physalins, natural steroidal compounds, appear to be mostly due to the activation of glucocorticoid receptors. Compounds derived from these natural secosteroids may represent novel therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."
2007,17603167,The effects of chronic treatment with Morus bombycis KOIDZUMI in spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"The present study was performed to evaluate the antihypertensive effects of Morus bombycis KOIDZUMI (MK) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In addition, the effects on vascular responses and cardiac functions were also investigated. In isolated rat aortic preparations, the 100% ethanol extract of MK exhibited a potent vascular relaxant effect with IC(50) value of 3.9 microg/ml, and this vasorelaxant effect was completely abolished by pretreatment of the aortic tissues with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or the denudation of endothelial layer. In isolated rat hearts, the MK extract significantly reduced cardiac functions such as left ventricular developed pressure and heart rate. In an antihypertensive study in SHRs, long-term administration with MK extracts (10, 30, 100 mg/kg) for 42 d dose-dependently decreased systolic blood pressure (approximately 20 mmHg). In SHRs, MK extract enhanced the aortic relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside after 42 d of treatment. In addition, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in liver of SHRs were also attenuated by long-term treatment with MK extract. These results suggest that chronic treatment with MK extract exerts an antihypertensive effect in SHRs, and its direct vasorelaxant, negative inotropic actions, and anti-oxidant properties may contribute to reduce the elevated blood pressure."
2015,25794239,Increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake by rosemary extract through AMPK activation.,"Stimulation of the energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) has been viewed as a targeted approach to increase glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and control blood glucose homeostasis. Rosemary extract (RE) has been reported to activate AMPK in hepatocytes and reduce blood glucose levels in vivo but its effects on skeletal muscle are not known. In the present study, we examined the effects of RE and the mechanism of regulation of glucose uptake in muscle cells. RE stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximum stimulation was seen with 5 μg/mL of RE for 4 h (184% ± 5.07% of control, p < 0.001), a response comparable to maximum insulin (207% ± 5.26%, p < 0.001) and metformin (216% ± 8.77%, p < 0.001) stimulation. RE did not affect insulin receptor substrate 1 and Akt phosphorylation but significantly increased AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Furthermore, the RE-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly reduced by the AMPK inhibitor compound C, but remained unchanged by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. RE did not affect GLUT4 or GLUT1 glucose transporter translocation in contrast with a significant translocation of both transporters seen with insulin or metformin treatment. Our study is the first to show a direct effect of RE on muscle cell glucose uptake by a mechanism that involves AMPK activation. "
2014,24842412,Arctigenin promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells via the iNOS/NO/STAT3/survivin signalling.,"Arctigenin is a biologically active lignan extracted from the seeds of Arctium lappa and shows anticancer activity against a variety of human cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of arctigenin on ovarian cancer cell proliferation and survival and associated molecular mechanisms. Human ovarian cancer OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells were treated with arctigenin, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. Western blot analysis was used to examine signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and survivin and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. The involvement of STAT3/survivin/iNOS/NO signalling in arctigenin action was checked. Arctigenin treatment resulted in a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Arctigenin-treated cells showed a 4-6 times increase in the percentage of apoptosis, compared with control cells. Pre-treatment with Ac-DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, counteracted the induction of apoptosis by arctigenin. Arctigenin treatment significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and survivin and iNOS expression. Arctigenin-induced apoptosis was impaired by pre-transfection with survivin-expressing plasmid or addition of chemical nitric oxide (NO) donors. Additionally, exogenous NO prevented the suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and survivin expression by arctigenin. Arctigenin treatment inhibits the proliferation and induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Suppression of iNOS/NO/STAT3/survivin signalling is causally linked to the anticancer activity of arctigenin. Therefore, arctigenin may be applicable to anticancer therapy for ovarian cancer. "
1999,10690216,Stability of rifabutin in two extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.,"The stability of rifabutin 20 mg/mL in two oral liquids was studied. Powder from 100 150-mg rifabutin capsules was placed in a glass mortar. Cherry syrup (pH 2.9) or a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories) was added to produce 750 mL of each formulation, which was then stored in 2-oz plastic prescription bottles. Three bottles of each formulation were stored at 4, 25, 30, and 40 degrees C. At 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, the bottles were collected and allowed to remain at room temperature for one hour; samples of about 1 mL were collected from each bottle, weighed, and assayed for rifabutin content by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rifabutin liquids prepared with cherry syrup and stored at 4, 25, and 30 degrees C lost a mean of < 8% of the initial drug concentration during the 12-week study; at 40 degrees C, the liquids lost > 10% of the initial drug concentration by 12 weeks. There was a mean loss of < 5% of the initial rifabutin concentration in all the liquids prepared with Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus. The liquid prepared with cherry syrup, upon standing, showed a tendency for some of the ingredients to float. The suspension prepared with Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus had a tendency to retain bubbles after it was shaken, but the ingredients did not settle upon standing. Rifabutin 20 mg/mL in two extemporaneously compounded oral liquids prepared from capsules and sweetened vehicles was stable for at least 12 weeks at 4, 25, 30, and 40 degrees C with the exception of rifabutin in cherry syrup, which was stable for only 8 weeks at 40 degrees C."
2015,25659569,Coconut oil supplementation and physical exercise improves baroreflex sensitivity and oxidative stress in hypertensive rats.,"The hypothesis that oral supplementation with virgin coconut oil (Cocos nucifera L.) and exercise training would improve impaired baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and reduce oxidative stress in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was tested. Adult male SHR and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were divided into 5 groups: WKY + saline (n = 8); SHR + saline (n = 8); SHR + coconut oil (2 mL·day(-1), n = 8); SHR + trained (n = 8); and SHR + trained + coconut oil (n = 8). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded and BRS was tested using phenylephrine (8 μg/kg, intravenous) and sodium nitroprusside (25 μg·kg(-1), intravenous). Oxidative stress was measured using dihydroethidium in heart and aorta. SHR + saline, SHR + coconut oil, and SHR + trained group showed higher MAP compared with WKY + saline (175 ± 6, 148 ± 6, 147 ± 7 vs. 113 ± 2 mm Hg; p < 0.05). SHR + coconut oil, SHR + trained group, and SHR + trained + coconut oil groups presented lower MAP compared with SHR + saline group (148 ± 6, 147 ± 7, 134 ± 8 vs. 175 ± 6 mm Hg; p < 0.05). Coconut oil combined with exercise training improved BRS in SHR compared with SHR + saline group (-2.47 ± 0.3 vs. -1.39 ± 0.09 beats·min(-1)·mm Hg(-1); p < 0.05). SHR + saline group showed higher superoxide levels when compared with WKY + saline (774 ± 31 vs. 634 ± 19 arbitrary units (AU), respectively; p < 0.05). SHR + trained + coconut oil group presented reduced oxidative stress compared with SHR + saline in heart (622 ± 16 vs. 774 ± 31 AU, p < 0.05). In aorta, coconut oil reduced oxidative stress in SHR compared with SHR + saline group (454 ± 33 vs. 689 ± 29 AU, p < 0.05). Oral supplementation with coconut oil combined with exercise training improved impaired BRS and reduced oxidative stress in SHR. "
2006,16861809,Isolation of Arabidopsis thaliana cDNAs that confer yeast boric acid tolerance.,"An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library was introduced into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacks ScBOR1 (YNL275W), a boron (B) efflux transporter. Five cDNAs were identified that confer tolerance to high boric acid. The nucleotide sequence analysis identified the clones as a polyadenylate-binding protein, AtPAB2; a ribosomal small subunit protein, AtRPS20B; an RNA-binding protein, AtRBP47c'; and two Myb transcription factors, AtMYB13 and AtMYB68. The expression of these five genes also conferred boric acid tolerance on wild-type yeast. Two yeast genes, ScRPS20 and ScHRB1, that are similar to the isolated clones, were necessary for this boric acid tolerance. The possible roles of these A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae genes in boric acid tolerance are discussed."
1994,8192451,Cytofluorometric analysis of chondrotoxicity of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents.,"To better understand quinolone-related arthropathy, we conceived an experimental ex vivo model using cell cultures of articular chondrocytes issued from pretreated New Zealand White rabbits (NZW). Juvenile (4- to 5-week-old) NZW were orally dosed with ofloxacin or pefloxacin (300 mg/kg of body weight for 1 day) or with pefloxacin (300 mg/kg for 7 days). Adult (5-month-old) NZW were treated with pefloxacin (300 mg/kg for 1 day). Chondrocytes were enzymatically recovered from cartilage and were analyzed by cytofluorometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), reflecting cellular respiratory-burst activity, and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and 10-N-nonyl-acridine orange (NAO), specific for the mitochondrial activity and mass, respectively. A significant increase in the respiratory burst was detected by DCFH-DA and DHR in all treated groups of young animals, compared with untreated control groups. No significant increase of respiratory burst was noted in older treated rabbits. The 7-day treatment resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial uptake of Rh123 and an increase in NAO uptake. Fluoroquinolone arthrotoxicity seems to involve in its early phase the respiratory burst of immature articular chondrocytes."
2012,22902482,Tailoring controlled-release oral dosage forms by combining inkjet and flexographic printing techniques.,"We combined conventional inkjet printing technology with flexographic printing to fabricate drug delivery systems with accurate doses and tailored drug release. Riboflavin sodium phosphate (RSP) and propranolol hydrochloride (PH) were used as water-soluble model drugs. Three different paper substrates: A (uncoated woodfree paper), B (triple-coated inkjet paper) and C (double-coated sheet fed offset paper) were used as porous model carriers for drug delivery. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) containing solutions were printed onto 1 cm × 1 cm substrate areas using an inkjet printer. The printed APIs were coated with water insoluble polymeric films of different thickness using flexographic printing. All substrates were characterized with respect to wettability, surface roughness, air permeability, and cell toxicity. In addition, content uniformity and release profiles of the produced solid dosage forms before and after coating were studied. The substrates were nontoxic for the human cell line assayed. Substrate B was smoothest and least porous. The properties of substrates B and C were similar, whereas those of substrate A differed significantly from those of B, C. The release kinetics of both printed APIs was slowest from substrate B before and after coating with the water insoluble polymer film, following by substrate C, whereas substrate A showed the fastest release. The release rate decreased with increasing polymer coating film thickness. The printed solid dosage forms showed excellent content uniformity. So, combining the two printing technologies allowed fabricating controlled-release oral dosage forms that are challenging to produce using a single technique. The approach opens up new perspectives in the manufacture of flexible doses and tailored drug-delivery systems."
2017,28595874,Evaluation of anti-diabetic activity of glycyrrhizin-loaded nanoparticles in nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.,"Glycyrrhizin is an active constituent of the roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza glabra and has anti-hyperglycemic effects. In this study, nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with glycyrrhizin or metformin were evaluated in vivo for their anti-hyperglycemic potency towards type-II diabetes in rats. The NPs were produced via the ionotropic gelation method using the biocompatible polymers chitosan and gum arabic. The polymer concentration was optimized using the 32 factorial method to acquire both minimum particle size and maximum encapsulation efficiency. The NPs were then characterized with respect to particle size, encapsulation efficiency, stability, chemical interactions, and in vitro drug dissolution profiles using spectroscopic and microscopic analysis. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin and metformin and their nanoformulations were administered for 21 successive days to diabetic rats. Glycyrrhizin-loaded NPs had significant anti-diabetic effects even though they contained approximately one quarter of the dosage relative to the pure form."
2015,26400229,[Effectiveness of phytotherapy in supportive treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus II. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum)].,"Fenugreek seeds are known for their characteristic smell of soup seasoning and as an ingredient of Indian curry. Traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes, cough, and flatulence, to increase breast milk secretion, and for anti-inflammatory and aphrodisiac effects. The use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate. Antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to galactomannan, 4-hydroxyisoleucin (4-OH-Ile), diosgenin and trigonelline. These substances demonstrate direct antidiabetic properties in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion (4-OH-Ile), decreasing insulin resistance and glucose resorption from the GIT (galactomannan) and improvement in B-cells regeneration (trigonelline). Besides this main effect, the herb improves blood lipid spectre (4-OH-Ile, diosgenin), and has reno-protective (4-OH-Ile, trigonelline), neuroprotective (trigonelline) and antioxidant (diosgenin, trigonelline) effects. Antidiabetic efficacy of trigonelline is comparable to glibenclamide treatment and more effective than sitagliptine therapy. Given the large body of evidence and promising results in comparison with standard pharmacotherapy, fenugreek active substances have a potential to become a source of new antidiabetic medication.Key words: fenugreek Trigonella foenum-graecum diabetes mellitus type 2 biological activity.

2018,29425747,"Annona muricata Linn. leaf as a source of antioxidant compounds with in vitro antidiabetic and inhibitory potential against α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase, non-enzymatic glycation and lipid peroxidation.","Annona muricata leaves are used in traditional medicine to manage diabetes mellitus and its complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential in vitro antidiabetic properties of Annona muricata leaf by identifying its main phytochemical constituents and characterizing the phenolic-enriched fractions for their in vitro antioxidant capacity and inhibitory activities against glycoside and lipid hydrolases, advanced glycation end-product formation and lipid peroxidation. Ethanol extract of A. muricata leaf was subjected to a liquid-liquid partitioning and its fractions were used in enzymatic assays to evaluate their inhibitory potential against α-amylase, α-glucosidase and lipase, as well as their antioxidant (DPPH, ORAC, FRAP and Fe2+-ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation assays) and anti-glycation (BSA-fructose, BSA-methylglyoxal and arginine-methylglyoxal models) capacities. In addition, identification of the main bioactive compounds of A. muricata leaf by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was carried out. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (BuOH) fractions showed, respectively, antioxidant properties (ORAC 3964 ± 53 and 2707 ± 519 μmol trolox eq g-1, FRAP 705 ± 35 and 289 ± 18 μmol trolox eq g-1, and DPPH IC50 4.3 ± 0.7 and 9.3 ± 0.8 μg mL-1) and capacity to reduce liver lipid peroxidation (p < .01). Also, EtOAc and BuOH, respectively, inhibited glycation in BSA-fructose (IC50 45.7 ± 13.5 and 61.9 ± 18.2 μg mL-1), BSA-methylglyoxal (IC50 166.1 ± 21.6 and 413.2 ± 49.5 μg mL-1) and arginine-methylglyoxal (IC50 437.9 ± 89.0 and 1191.0 ± 199.0 μg mL-1) assays, α-amylase (IC50 9.2 ± 2.3 and 6.1 ± 1.6 μg mL-1), α-glucosidase (IC50 413.1 ± 121.1 and 817.4 ± 87.9 μg mL-1) and lipase (IC50 74.2 ± 30.1 and 120.3 ± 50.5 μg.mL-1), and presented lower cytotoxicity, when compared to the other fractions and crude extract. Various biomolecules known as potent antioxidants were identified in these fractions, such as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, procyanidins B2 and C1, (epi)catechin, quercetin, quercetin-hexosides and kaempferol. This study presents new biological activities not yet described for A. muricata, which contributes to the understanding of the potential effectiveness in the use of the A. muricata leaf, especially its polyphenols-enriched fractions, for the management of diabetes mellitus and its complications."
2010,19854159,"3,3'-Diindolylmethane attenuates experimental arthritis and osteoclastogenesis.","3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a natural compound formed during the autolysis of glucobrassicin present in Brassica food plants. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacies of DIM on experimental arthritis. The effects of DIM on experimental arthritis were examined on a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), with daily AIA paw swelling observation and histological/radiographic analysis. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of its action, serum cytokine levels as well as the expression of receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in infected tissues were subsequently analyzed. The impact of DIM on osteoclastogenesis was further investigated on a mouse model of endotoxin-induced bone resorption (EIBR) and in vitro cultures of fibroblast-like cells and osteoblasts, with RANKL expression being evaluated with great interest. The administration of DIM was demonstrated to attenuate AIA in animal models, as judged by clinical and histologic indices of inflammation and tissue damage. On the one hand, DIM could reduce the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, which was, however, not adequate to prevent the development of the arthritis. On the other hand, DIM was shown to effectively inhibit the expression of RANKL, leading to the blockade of osteoclastogenesis and consequently an alleviation of experimental arthritis. Further in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the inhibition of RANKL by DIM. DIM has shown anti-arthritis activity in animal models via inhibiting the expression of RANKL, and thus may offer potential treatments for arthritis and associated disorders."
2008,18776917,"trans-Resveratrol, an extract of red wine, inhibits human eosinophil activation and degranulation.","trans-Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenol found abundantly in red wine possesses antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activity in various inflammatory disease conditions. However, the effect of trans-resveratrol on eosinophil activation in relation to allergy has not been investigated.Human eosinophils were isolated and purified from whole blood and incubated for 16 h with trans-resveratrol. Eosinophil chemotaxis, activation and degranulation, and apoptosis were investigated. The effect of trans-resveratrol on the inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 activation was examined.Treatment of human eosinophils with trans-resveratrol at concentrations <100 microM for 16 h did not induce eosinophil apoptosis. Similar results were seen after 24 h and 48 h incubations. trans-Resveratrol (<100 microM) significantly inhibited eosinophil peroxidase release after activation with IL-5 (IC(50)=2.9+/-0.9 microM) or C5a (IC(50)=3.9+/-0.5 microM) after 5 min priming with cytochalasin B (CB). Similarly, the production of leukotriene C4 after stimulation with calcium ionophore, and eosinophil chemotaxis in response to eotaxin, as well as CD11b upregulation and CD62 L shedding was also significantly reduced by trans-resveratrol, at concentrations above 5 microM. All the activators induced p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation maximal at 2 min of activation. trans-Resveratrol potently inhibited p38 and ERK1/2 activation after calcium ionophore and CB and C5a activation.trans-Resveratrol is effective at inhibiting human eosinophil activation and degranulation at concentrations <100 microM, while not inducing apoptosis. This potent anti-inflammatory activity of trans-resveratrol and possibly its metabolites on eosinophils may be worth investigating for the treatment of eosinophil-related allergic diseases."
2014,23607724,"Pharmaceutical optimization of lipid-based dosage forms for the improvement of taste-masking, chemical stability and solubilizing capacity of phenobarbital.","Microemulsions (MEs) and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEEDS) containing phenobarbital (Phe) were developed to improve its chemical stability, solubilizing capacity and taste-masking in oral liquid dosage forms. Cremophor® RH40 and Labrasol® were used as surfactants for the screening of ME regions, Capmul® MCM L, Captex® 355, Imwitor® 408, Myglyol® 840 and Isopropyl myristate were the oil phases assayed; Transcutol® P, Polyethylene-glycol 400, glycerol, Propylene-glycol and ethanol the cosurfactants. Phe stability assay was carried out (20:4:20:56% and 20:4:35:41% (w/w); surfactant:oily phase:cosurfactant:water) for both surfactants; only one containing ethanol showed significant dismissing in its drug content. Solubility capacity for these selected formulations were also evaluated, an amount between 17 and 58 mg/mL of Phe could be loaded. At last, an optimized ME formulation with Cremophor® RH40 20%, Capmul® MCM L 4%, PEG 400 35% and sucralose 2% (w/w) was chosen in order to optimize taste-masking using an electronic tongue. Strawberry along with banana and tutti-frutti flavors plus mint flavor proved to be the best ones. Labrasol-based pre-concentrates were tested for (micro)emulsifying properties; all of them resulted to behave as SEDDS. In summary, a rationale experimental design conducted to an optimized ME for Phe oral pediatric administration which was able to load 5-fold times the currently used dose (4 mg/mL), with no sign of physical or chemical instability and with improved taste; SEDDS for capsule filling were also obtained. The biopharmaceutical advantages described for these dosage forms encourage furthering in vivo evaluation."
2018,29191767,"Capsaicin, the primary constituent of pepper sprays and its pharmacological effects on mammalian ocular tissues.","Capsaicin is the principal constituent of oleoresin capsicum, or pepper spray, as it is commonly known. Pepper sprays are frequently used in riot control situations by defence organizations all over the world to deal with uncontrolled civil or criminal disturbances. Although capsaicin is noted for its irritant and inflammatory properties, the ocular profile of capsaicin has not been specifically studied and interpreted. The present review analyses the mammalian opthalmological profile of capsaicin and its pharmacological and toxicological manifestations including capsaicin induced corneal changes, neurogenic inflammation, neuroprotective influences on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), depletion of neuropeptide content in sensory nerve terminals etc. Substantial views on the capsaicin receptor Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid V1 (TRPV1), its presence, significance and capsaicin induced mediations have been presented. Studies conducted previously on the reversal of capsaicin evoked ocular responses have been briefly demonstrated. In this regard, TRPV1 antagonists (especially the competitive antagonist Capsazepine) have been indicated as potential candidates in mitigating or alleviating capsaicin elicited ocular responses. The review overall is a comprehensive perspective of the ocular inflammatory and pharmacological responses generated on exposure to capsaicin and concludes suggesting a possible regulatory framework for relief from the same presumably by the employment of specialized and target specific TRPV1 antagonists."
2010,20040693,Multiple pathways ensure retinoid delivery to milk: studies in genetically modified mice.,"Retinoids are absolutely required for normal growth and development during the postnatal period. We studied the delivery of retinoids to milk, availing of mouse models modified for proteins thought to be essential for this process. Milk retinyl esters were markedly altered in mice lacking the enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (Lrat(-/-)), indicating that this enzyme is normally responsible for the majority of retinyl esters incorporated into milk and not an acyl-CoA dependent enzyme, as proposed in the literature. Unlike wild-type milk, much of the retinoid in Lrat(-/-) milk is unesterified retinol, not retinyl ester. The composition of the residual retinyl ester present in Lrat(-/-) milk was altered from predominantly retinyl palmitate and stearate to retinyl oleate and medium chain retinyl esters. This was accompanied by increased palmitate and decreased oleate in Lrat(-/-) milk triglycerides. In other studies, we investigated the role of retinol-binding protein in retinoid delivery for milk formation. We found that Rbp(-/-) mice maintain milk retinoid concentrations similar to those in matched wild-type mice. This appears to arise due to greater postprandial delivery of retinoid, a lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-dependent pathway. Importantly, LPL also acts to assure delivery of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) to milk. The fatty acid transporter CD36 also facilitated LCFA but not retinoid incorporation into milk. Our data show that compensatory pathways for the delivery of retinoids ensure their optimal delivery and that LRAT is the most important enzyme for milk retinyl ester formation."

2005,16301974,[Treatment of venous thromboembolic disease].,"Adequate initial anticoagulant treatment is required to prevent thrombus growth and recurrence. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is being replaced by low-molecular-weight heparin as the anticoagulant of choice for initial treatment of venous thromboembolism. Vitamin K antagonists remain the only oral anticoagulant available (target international normalized ratio: 2.5). The duration of therapy should be individualized according to the risk of recurrence and the risk of bleeding. Three months of treatment is usually adequate if thrombosis was provoked by a reversible risk factor such as surgery. For patients with unprovoked (""idiopathic"") thrombosis, anticoagulant treatment for at least 6 months is indicated. For patients with a recurrence of venous thromboembolism or with an irreversible risk factor such as cancer, indefinite anticoagulant therapy is recommended. Long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin is usually preferable for patients with active cancer. Systemic thrombolysis is indicated for patients with massive pulmonary embolism but controversy persists for those with isolated right ventricular dysfunction."
2013,24076022,Small molecule stimulation enhances bone regeneration but not titanium implant osseointegration.,"The osteogenic and osseointegrative potential of a small molecule was examined to assess its usefulness in regenerative procedures. Purmorphamine was used to stimulate bone growth and repair in an in vitro cell-based assay and an in vivo chick embryo CAM-assay with and without the presence of an implant. Purmorphamine adhered to precipitated hydroxyapatite coating, could activate the sonic hedgehog pathway and thereby stimulated osteodifferentiation. Porous calcium phosphate beads were used to deliver this small molecule in vivo and showed that purmorphamine increased the trabecular bone to bone area significantly. The assay showed purmorphamine failed to induce any significant difference in osseointegration on titanium coated PTFE implants. This suggests that, while a small molecule can enhance osteogenesis and might be useful in regenerative procedures, it failed to enhance the osseointegration of a Ti coated implant, suggesting that this sort of stimulation might be useful for enhancing bone regeneration where bone loss due to disease exists, but not for enhancing early stability of an implant.

2000,10718345,"Effect of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, on reactive oxygen species and prostaglandin production.","Resveratrol is a natural molecule with antioxidant action. Moreover, resveratrol is also considered to be a molecule with anti-inflammatory action, an effect attributed to suppression of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a polyphenol present in most red wines, on reactive oxygen species formation as well as on arachidonic acid (AA) release, cyclooxygenase expression, and PG synthesis in murine resident peritoneal macrophages. Results show that resveratrol exerted a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide radical (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or phorbol esters (PMA). Resveratrol also significantly decreased [3H]AA release induced by LPS and PMA or by exposure to O2- or H2O2. Resveratrol treatment caused a significant impairment of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction stimulated by LPS and PMA or by O2- or H2O2 exposure. These effects of resveratrol on [3H]AA release and COX-2 overexpression were correlated with a marked reduction of PG synthesis. Our results indicate that the antioxidant action of resveratrol affects AA mobilization and COX-2 induction."
2015,25384364,"Development of formulae for estimating amylose content, amylopectin chain length distribution, and resistant starch content based on the iodine absorption curve of rice starch.","Not only amylose but also amylopectin greatly affects the gelatinization properties of rice starch and the quality of cooked rice grains. We here characterized the starches of 32 rice cultivars and evaluated the relationship between their iodine absorption curve, apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting property, resistant starch (RS) content, and chain length distribution of amylopectin. We found that the iodine absorption curve differed among the various sample rice cultivars. Using the wavelength at which absorbance becomes maximum on iodine staining of starch (λmax), we propose a novel index, ""new λmax"" (AAC/(λmax of sample rice starches-λmax of glutinous rice starch)). We developed the novel estimation formulae for AAC, RS contents, and amylopectin fractions with the use of λmax and ""new λmax."" These formulae would lead to the improved method for estimating starch properties using an easy and rapid iodine colorimetric method. "

Modern pharmacological experiments showed that HF extract has various pharmaceutical properties and flavonoids are considered as the main bioactive compounds. In this paper, Diaion HP-20 adsorption chromatography was used to enrich flavonoids in PHF, and the phytochemical composition of EPHF was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In addition, EPHF's antioxidant capacity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and cytotoxic activity were evaluated.EPHF was obtained by Diaion HP-20 adsorption chromatography. Phytochemical composition of EPHF was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using HPLC and LC-MS. Radical scavenging capacity of EPHF was estimated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of EPHF was evaluated by Ellman method. Cytotoxic activity of EPHF was assessed by means of MTT assay.Eight kinds of components were identified, in which ideain with the value of 179.4 mg/g was identified to be present in the highest level in EPHF, followed by (-)-epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, cyanidin 3-arabinoside, hyperoside and isoquercitrin at the concentrations of 40.9, 10.0, 1.4, 0.4 and 0.2 mg/g, respectively. The contents of these compounds in EPHF were much higher than those in PHF and HF. In addition, EPHF exhibited strong antioxidant and AChE inhibitory activity (ORAC value: 11.65 ± 2.37 μM Trolox equivalents (TE)/mg, DPPH IC50 value: 6.72 μg/mL, anti-AChE activity IC50 value: 11.72 μg/mL) compared with PHF and HF. Moreover, EPHF exhibited high levels of cytotoxicity on MCF-7 and SKOV-3 human tumour cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with the IC50 of 2.76 and 80.11 μg/mL, respectively.Macroporous resin is useful for the extraction and separation of the total flavonoids from PHF. The contents of flavonoids especially anthocyanin in EPHF were increased significantly compared with the PHF, and EPHF exhibited strong antioxidant, AChE inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity on human tumour cells."
2001,11758911,Modulation of cytochrome P4501-mediated bioactivation of benzo[a]pyrene by volatile allyl sulfides in human hepatoma cells.,"Allyl sulfides such as diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), typical flavor components of Allium vegetables, have been shown to inhibit benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced carcinogenesis in animal models. As a possible mechanism of this inhibition, the effect of these volatile substances on cytochrome P450 (CYP)1 (CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1)-mediated bioactivation of B[a]P was investigated using a human hepatoma cell model (HepG2). DADS and DATS inhibited the B[a]P-induced ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, a marker enzyme for CYP1, by 30-90% and 70-95% at 100-1,000 microM concentration, respectively. The cell viability, an indicator of the capacity to inhibit B[a]P bioactivation, was increased by treatments of 100-1,000 microM DADS and 10-100 microM DATS. Immunoblot results indicated that the B[a]P inducible CYP1A2 protein was suppressed by 100-1,000 microM of DADS and 10-100 microM of DATS, but CYP1A1 and 1B1 were not detectable in any microsomes. Analysis of B[a]P metabolites revealed that the level of 7,8-diol formed was significantly reduced in the DADS and DATS treated microsomes as compared to the control. The level of 9,10-diol and 4,5-diol formed was also lowered by the allyl sulfide treatments. These results suggest that the protective mechanism of allyl sulfides on B[a]P-induced carcinogenesis is possibly related with the modulation of CYP1-mediated bioactivation of B[a]P."
2012,25683408,Purification and characterization of a papaya (Carica papaya L.) pectin methylesterase isolated from a commercial papain preparation.,"We purified a Carica papaya pectin methylesterase (CpL-PME; EC 3.1.1.11) from a commercial papain preparation. This CpL-PME was separated from the abundant cysteine endopeptidases activities using sequential hydrophobic interaction and cation-exchange chromatographies and then purified by affinity chromatography using Sepharose-immobilized kiwi PME inhibitor protein to obtain a single electrophoretically homogeneous protein. The enzyme was purified 92-fold with 38% yield, providing a specific activity of 1200 U/mg. The molecular weight was determined to be 35,135 by MALDI-TOF-MS in linear mode. MALDI-TOF-MS peptide mass fingerprinting following trypsin digestion indicated CpL-PME represents a novel Carica PME isoform. The CpL-PME required salt for activity, and it showed a broad activity range (pH 6-9) and moderate thermostability (optimum ca. 70°C). A calcium-insensitive methylated lime pectin treated with CpL-PME to reduce degree of methylesterification by 6% converted the substrate to high calcium sensitivity, indicating a processive mode of action. These properties support further research to apply CpL-PME to tailor pectin nanostructure. "
2018,28873592,Statistical interpretation of chromatic indicators in correlation to phytochemical profile of a sulfur dioxide-free mulberry (Morus nigra) wine submitted to non-thermal maturation processes.,"The four different methods of color measurement of wine proposed by Boulton, Giusti, Glories and Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) were applied to assess the statistical relationship between the phytochemical profile and chromatic characteristics of sulfur dioxide-free mulberry (Morus nigra) wine submitted to non-thermal maturation processes. The alteration in chromatic properties and phenolic composition of non-thermal aged mulberry wine were examined, aided by the used of Pearson correlation, cluster and principal component analysis. The results revealed a positive effect of non-thermal processes on phytochemical families of wines. From Pearson correlation analysis relationships between chromatic indexes and flavonols as well as anthocyanins were established. Cluster analysis highlighted similarities between Boulton and Giusti parameters, as well as Glories and CIE parameters in the assessment of chromatic properties of wines. Finally, principal component analysis was able to discriminate wines subjected to different maturation techniques on the basis of their chromatic and phenolics characteristics."
2009,19426689,Identification of 5-lipoxygenase and microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 as functional targets of the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic garcinol.,"Garcinol (camboginol) from the fruit rind of Guttiferae species shows anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that garcinol potently interferes with 5-lipoxygenase (EC 7.13.11.34) and microsomal prostaglandin (PG)E2 synthase (mPGES)-1 (EC 5.3.99.3), enzymes that play pivotal roles in inflammation and tumorigenesis. In cell-free assays, garcinol inhibited the activity of purified 5-lipoxygenase and blocked the mPGES-1-mediated conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 with IC50 values of 0.1 and 0.3 microM, respectively. Garcinol suppressed 5-lipoxygenase product formation also in intact human neutrophils and reduced PGE2 formation in interleukin-1beta-stimulated A549 human lung carcinoma cells as well as in human whole blood stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, garcinol interfered with isolated cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (EC 1.14.99.1, IC50 = 12 microM) and with the formation of COX-1-derived 12(S)-hydroxy-5-cis-8,10-trans-heptadecatrienoic acid and thromboxane B2 in human platelets. In contrast, neither Ca2+-ionophore (A23187)-induced arachidonic acid release in neutrophils nor COX-2 activity in A549 cells or whole blood, measured as formation of 6-keto PGF1alpha, or isolated human recombinant COX-2 were significantly affected by garcinol (< or = 30 microM). Together, the high potency of garcinol to selectively suppress PGE2 synthesis and 5-lipoxygenase product formation provides a molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects of garcinol and rationalizes its therapeutic use."
1991,1892274,High sulfide concentrations in rumen fluid associated with nutritionally induced polioencephalomalacia in calves.,"Nine 115- to 180-kg, hay-adapted, Holstein steers were fed an experimental diet with added sodium sulfate that induces polioencephalomalacia (PEM). Five calves developed the disease. Thiamine concentrations in blood, CSF, brain, and liver were not indicative of thiamine deficiency. The odor of hydrogen sulfide in eructated rumen gas was associated with the onset of PEM. Sulfide concentrations in rumen fluid were measured 1 or 2 times a week by 2 techniques. Sulfide concentrations progressively increased in all 9 calves after the feeding of the PEM-inducing diet commenced. The highest concentrations coincided with the onset of clinical signs of PEM and were significantly higher in the calves that developed PEM than in those that did not. This suggests that PEM can result from sulfide toxicosis following excess production of sulfide in the rumen."
2005,16168554,Cytogenetic effects of commercial formulation of cypermethrin in root meristem cells of Allium sativum: spectroscopic basis of chromosome damage.,"To validate the use of Allium sativum as a sensitive test model for genotoxicity, the cytogenetic effects of a commercial formulation of the pyrethroid insecticide, cypermethrin, were evaluated in the root meristem cells of A. sativum. Ultraviolet (UV) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral measurements were also carried out to understand the interaction of cypermethrin with DNA. In a preliminary toxicity assay, the EC50 for Allium root growth was estimated to be 8 ppm. For the cytogenetic assay, root meristem cells were exposed to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 ppm of the test compound for 24 h, and either processed immediately for analysis or incubated in water for 24 h of recovery and then processed. Cells analyzed immediately after the exposure had a significant, dose-dependent inhibition of mitotic index (MI) and induction of mitotic and chromosomal aberrations (MAs and CAs). The 24 h recovery period reduced the effect of the test compound on the MI and percent aberrations; however, cells exposed to 8 and 16 ppm showed a significant frequency of aberrations despite the recovery period. One part per million cypermethrin was consistently negative in the assay. The data indicate that higher doses of cypermethrin produce toxicity, CAs and MAs in A. sativum. The present study indicates that A. sativum is a sensitive and reliable test system. A bathochromic shift observed in UV absorption spectra reveals that cypermethrin binds with DNA. Role of vibrational modes of the active site in the recognition and reaction of cypermethrin with DNA has been discussed. Based on spectroscopic data and structural properties, a possible mechanism has been proposed for the interaction of cypermethrin with DNA resulting in chromosomal aberrations."
2014,25141100,"Serum amyloid A-related inflammation is lowered by increased fruit and vegetable intake, while high-sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6 and E-selectin remain unresponsive.","The present study assessed whether increased fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake reduced the concentrations of the inflammatory marker serum amyloid A (SAA) in serum, HDL2 and HDL3 and whether the latter reduction influenced any of the functional properties of these HDL subfractions. The present study utilised samples from two previous studies: (1) the FAVRIT (Fruit and Vegetable Randomised Intervention Trial) study - hypertensive subjects (systolic blood pressure (BP) range 140-190 mmHg; diastolic BP range 90-110 mmHg) were randomised to receive a 1-, 3- or 6-portion F&V/d intervention for 8 weeks, and (2) the ADIT (Ageing and Dietary Intervention Trial) study - older subjects (65-85 years) were randomised to receive a 2- or 5-portion F&V/d intervention for 16 weeks. HDL2 and HDL3 were isolated by rapid ultracentrifugation. Measurements included the following: serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) by an immunoturbidimetric assay; serum IL-6 and E-selectin and serum-, HDL2- and HDL3-SAA by ELISA procedures; serum-, HDL2- and HDL3-cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity by a fluorometric assay. Although the concentrations of hsCRP, IL-6 and E-selectin were unaffected by increasing F&V intake in both studies (P>0·05 for all comparisons), those of SAA in HDL3 decreased in the FAVRIT cohort (P= 0·049) and those in HDL2 and HDL3 decreased in the ADIT cohort (P= 0·035 and 0·032), which was accompanied by a decrease in the activity of CETP in HDL3 in the FAVRIT cohort (P= 0·010) and in HDL2 in the ADIT cohort (P= 0·030). These results indicate that SAA responds to increased F&V intake, while other inflammatory markers remain unresponsive, and this leads to changes in HDL2 and HDL3, which may influence their antiatherogenic potential. Overall, the present study provides tangible evidence of the effectiveness of increased F&V intake, which may be of use to health policy makers and the general public. "

IL-6 concentration was significantly increased (p < .05) in SHED and PBL culture supernatant when treated with UPJ. SCF synthesis in SHED culture was also significantly increased (p < .05) when treated with UPJ CONCLUSION: In vitro upregulated synthesis of IL -6 and SCF both in PBL and SHED reveals the potential mechanism of unripe papaya to induce thrombopoietic cytokines synthesis in cells of hematopoietic and mesenchymal origin."
1993,8239585,In vivo administration of azithromycin affects lymphocyte activity in vitro.,"A therapeutic dose of azithromycin was administered to test subjects and then the following lymphocyte functions were examined in vitro: proliferative lymphocyte response to stimulation with pokeweed mitogen, levels of immunoglobulins G, A, and M in serum, and the amount of the soluble interleukin 2 receptors in supernatants of mononuclear cell cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate. The study was performed as a controlled clinical trial comparing an azithromycin-treated group (n = 21) and a placebo-treated control group (n = 10). Healthy female volunteers were placed into one of the two groups, and the study was performed as a double-blind trial. Although the findings of the present study showed that azithromycin significantly increased the proliferative lymphocyte response to pokeweed mitogen, the results could have been due to experimental variation. However, impairment of the lymphocyte function was not observed, which could represent valuable information. Likewise, no effect of azithromycin on levels of the immunoglobulins in serum was observed. The most marked effect of azithromycin on the lymphocyte function was demonstrated by an elevation in the amount of soluble interleukin 2 receptor production in mononuclear cell cultures. The lack of impairment or, perhaps, even a beneficial influence on the immunodefense system may be an important property of azithromycin, especially in immunocompromised individuals."
1994,7764518,A wine arabinogalactan-protein that reduces heat-induced wine protein haze.,"An arabinogalactan-protein which reduced the heat-induced turbidity of protein in wine was purified from a red wine. The arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) was composed of a central 3-linked galactan core carrying, at position 6, 6-linked galactan chains which were in turn heavily substituted at positions 3 and 4 by terminal arabinofuranose residues and short 5-linked arabinan chains. The protein (13% by weight) was dominated by serine, alanine, hydroxyproline, and threonine and also contained a relatively high amount of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine. The molecular weight, estimated by universal calibration, was 210,000. Enzymatic removal of the terminal arabinofuranosyl units of the active AGP and subsequent partial shortening of the outer 6-linked galactan chains did not affect the haze protective activity. Periodate oxidation and then Smith degradation greatly reduced the size of the polysaccharide, its amount of protein, and eliminated its absorption at 280 nm and its haze protective activity."
2005,16204939,Increase in bone mass and bone strength by Sambucus williamsii HANCE in ovariectomized rats.,"Herbal Sambucus williamsii HANCE (SWH) is a folk medicine with a long history of safe use for treatment of bone fractures and joint diseases in China. The present study was designed to investigate if SWH extract could be used for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. SWH extracts (30 or 60 mg/100 g body weight/d) were orally administrated to four-months-old ovariectomized (OVX) rats for 3 months. SWH extracts did not alter weight gain and uterus weight in OVX rats. SWH extracts significantly increased serum Ca levels (p<0.05, vs. OVX control group) as well as decreased urinary Ca excretion (p<0.01, vs. OVX control group) in OVX rats. The upregulation of serum alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin as well as urinary deoxypyridinoline levels by OVX was suppressed by treatment with SWH extracts in rats (p<0.05, vs. OVX control group). SWH extract increased the stiffness of femur at both dosage (p<0.05, vs. OVX control group) and increased tibial bone mineral density at 60 mg/100 g body weight/d (p<0.05, vs. OVX control group) in OVX rats. Our results indicate that orally administrated SWH extracts can decrease urinary calcium excretion and bone turnover rate in OVX rats, resulting in positive effects on biomechanical strength of bone and bone mineral density. This study is the first to report that SWH could be considered as a potential candidate for management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Then in vitro experiments were performed to determine the potential molecular mechanism of the anti-osteoporotic effect of SWH. Results suggested that chloroform fraction and ethyl acetate fraction of SWH can inhibit osteoclastogenesis osteoclast by modulating the expression of osteoprotegrin (OPG) and receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA in osteoblastic UMR 106 cells. Both of them increased OPG mRNA and decreased RANKL mRNA expression, resulting in a dose-dependent increase in OPG/RANKL mRNA ratio (p<0.01, vs. vehicle-treated). Taken together, SWH treatment can effectively suppress the OVX-induced increase in bone turnover and its effects might be mediated by a decrease in osteoclastogenesis."
1999,10086329,Effects of the wine polyphenolics quercetin and resveratrol on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.,"The beneficial effects of moderate red wine consumption have been attributed, in part, to the presence of antioxidant components. Oxidant stress is an activating stimulus for the NF (nuclear factor)-KB/Rel family of transcription factors, which have binding sites in the promoter regions of many genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses. The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated activation of NF-KB and the subsequent production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and NO was determined in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Unexpectedly, the wine polyphenolics quercetin and resveratrol and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) did not inhibit LPS-induced activation of the NF-KB complex p50/65, as determined by mobility shift. Quercetin inhibited LPS-induced p50/50. Northern blot analysis indicated that quercetin (0.1 and 0.2 mM) inhibited LPS-dependent production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and decreased NO release, as measured by the Griess reaction. This flavonoid had no effect on LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA, but decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release, as measured by ELISA. Resveratrol (0.05 and 0.1 mM) posttranscriptionally decreased LPS-induced nitrite release. It increased basal levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein and enhanced LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA and cytokine release. Our results do not support the view that wine antioxidants inhibit LPS-induced NF-KB activation but instead that they have a more selective action on genes activated by LPS."
2008,18579286,Multitargeted prevention and therapy of cancer by diallyl trisulfide and related Allium vegetable-derived organosulfur compounds.,"Allium vegetables, such as garlic, have been used for medicinal purposes throughout the recorded history. The known health benefits of Allium vegetables constituents include cardiovascular effects, improvement of the immune function, lowering of blood glucose level, radioprotection, protection against microbial infections, and anti-cancer effects. Initial evidence for the anti-cancer effect of Allium vegetables was provided by population-based case-control studies. Subsequent laboratory studies showed that the Allium vegetable constituents, such as diallyl disulfide, S-allylcysteine, and ajoene can not only offer protection against chemically induced cancer in animal models by altering carcinogen metabolism, but also suppress growth of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Suppression of angiogenesis and experimental metastasis by Allium constituents has also been reported. Defining the mechanism by which sulfur compounds derived from Allium vegetables inhibit cancer cell growth has been the topic of intense research in the last two decades. Some Allium vegetable constituents have also entered clinical trials to assess their safety and anti-cancer efficacy. This article summarizes preclinical and limited clinical data to warrant further clinical evaluation of Allium vegetable constituents for prevention and therapy of human cancers."
2010,20427709,Estrogen receptor mediates the effects of pseudoprotodiocsin on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.,"Estrogen receptors (ERs) play a pivotal role in adipogenesis; therefore, compounds targeting ERs may also affect fat formation. Recent studies have shown that the Dioscorea plant (commonly called yam) exhibits an antiobesity effect on rodents. However, the active compounds and underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the effects of pseudoprotodiocsin (PPD), a steroid saponin from Dioscorea nipponica Makino (a type of Dioscorea), on adipogenesis and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Treatment with PPD at the onset of adipogenic differentiation resulted in significantly decreased adipogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. An increased amount of ERalpha mRNA, protein, and the accumulation of ERalpha in the nucleus were also observed. However, the expression pattern of ERbeta was not altered. Furthermore, the antiadipogenic effect of PPD was found to be ER dependent. It was also accompanied by the decreased expression of several genes involved in adipogenesis, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leptin, CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), as well as the increased expression of some negative factors of adipogenesis, including preadipocyte factor 1 (Pre-1), GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA-2), GC-induced leucine-zipper protein (GILZ), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP-10). In addition to its estrogenic action, PPD also abolished the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation. Our results suggest that PPD inhibits adipogenesis in an ER-dependent manner and induces the expression of ERalpha. These findings may provide a lead toward a novel agent that can be used to treat obesity."
2014,25256382,"Anti-inflammatory effect of the sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden, the Tiger Milk mushroom.","The sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden (Tiger Milk mushroom) is used as a traditional medicine to relieve cough, asthma and chronic hepatitis. The traditional uses of the sclerotium are presumably related to its anti-inflammatory effect. The present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the sclerotial powder of L. rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden (Tiger Milk mushroom) cultivar TM02.The anti-acute inflammatory activity of the sclerotial powder of L. rhinocerotis cultivar TM02 was investigated using carrageenan-induced paw edema test while the inhibition of transudative and proliferative phases of chronic inflammation were studied by cotton pellet induced granuloma model. Sprague Dawley rats were used in both studies. The anti-inflammatory activity was also measured by inhibition of lipopolysaccharide induced TNF-alpha production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.Cold water extract (CWE), hot water extract (HWE) and methanol extract (ME) of the sclerotial powder of L. rhinocerotis cultivar TM02 possessed anti-acute inflammatory activity as was measured by carrageenan-induced paw edema test, with CWE being the most potent. The acute anti-inflammatory activity of the cold water extract (CWE) was mainly contributed by its high molecular weight (HMW) fraction isolated by Sephadex G50 gel filtration chromatography. Its protein component was very potent in the inhibition of TNF-alpha production with an IC50 of 0.76 μg/ml. CWE at 200 mg/kg did not inhibit transudative and proliferative phase of chronic inflammation as shown by using the cotton pellet induced granuloma model.Our results suggested that most of the bioactive substance(s) contributed to the acute-inflammatory activity of the sclerotial powder of L. rhinocerotis cultivar TM02 appear to be in the CWE, particularly its HMW fraction. The anti-inflammatory activity of CWE was mainly contributed by the protein component of the high molecular weight (HMW) fraction and it exhibited strong inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha production but the possibility of synergistic effect between HMW, MMW and LMW fractions cannot be excluded. Future studies will provide new insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of the sclerotial powder."
2012,23259718,"Solenostemon monostachyus, Ipomoea involucrata and Carica papaya seed oil versus Glutathione, or Vernonia amygdalina: methanolic extracts of novel plants for the management of sickle cell anemia disease.","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease caused by an individual inheriting an allele for sickle cell hemoglobin from both parents and is associated with unusually large numbers of immature blood cells, containing many long, thin, crescent-shaped erythrocytes. It is a disease prevalent throughout many populations. The use of medicinal plants and nutrition in managing SCD is gaining increasing attention.The antisickling effects of Solenostemon monostachyus (SolMon), Carica papaya seed oil (Cari-oil) and Ipomoea involucrata (Ipocrata) in male (HbSSM) and female (HbSSF) human sickle cell blood was examined in vitro and compared with controls, or cells treated with glutathione or an antisickling plant (Vernonia amygdalina; VerMyg).Levels of sickle blood cells were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in all the plant-extract treated SCD patients' blood compared with that of untreated SCD patients. RBCs in SolMon, Ipocrata, and Cari-oil treated samples were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with VerMyg-treated samples. The Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) ratio was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in all plant extract-treated HbSSM samples compared with controls. Hemoglobin concentration was significantly increased (P < 0.05) by SolMon treatment in HbSSF compared with VerMyg. Sickle cell polymerization inhibition exhibited by SolMon was significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with that of VerMyg in HbSSF blood. Sickle cell polymerization inhibition in SolMon and Ipocrata were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with VerMyg in HbSSM blood. All plant extracts significantly reduced (P < 0.05) lactate dehydrogenase activity in both HbSSM and HbSSF-treated blood. Catalase activity was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in HbSSF blood treated with Ipocrata compared with glutathione. Cari-oil treated HbSSM and HbSSF blood had significantly increased (P < 0.05) peroxidase activity compared with controls.Methanolic extracts from S. monostachyus, C. papaya seed oil and I. involucrata exhibited particular antisickling properties coupled with the potential to reduce stress in sickle cell patients. Each plant individually or in combination may be useful for the management of sickle cell disease."
2007,17691585,Interactions between iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex and commonly used drugs / simulations and in vitro studies.,"Under physiological conditions, ferric ions are essentially insoluble because of the formation of polynuclear hydroxo-bridged complexes. Ferrous ions are more soluble but may produce hydroxyl radicals on reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Chelation of ferric and ferrous ions with organic ligands may prevent these undesirable reactions. Alternatively, iron(III)-hydroxide/oxide can be stabilized and solubilized by tight interactions with carbohydrates. The data presented in this work show that, because of its physicochemical properties, the iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC, Maltofer) does not interact with the active ingredients of commonly used drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid (CAS 50-78-2), tetracycline hydrochloride (CAS 64-75-5), calcium hydrogen-phosphate (CAS 7757-93-9), methyl-L-dopa sesquihydrate (CAS 41372-08-1), and magnesium-L-aspartate hydrochloride (CAS 28184-71-6). In contrast, as confirmed by calculations using thermodynamic parameters, FeCl3 x 6H2O (CAS 10025-77-1) can form different types of complexes with these substances. Moreover, the data show that under aerobic conditions high concentrations of ascorbic acid (CAS 50-81-7) can lead to mobilization of iron from IPC and, thus, support the observation that orange juice slightly increases the uptake of iron from IPC."
2012,22248096,Analysis of tanshinone IIA induced cellular apoptosis in leukemia cells by genome-wide expression profiling.,"Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is a diterpene quinone extracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, a Chinese traditional herb. Although previous studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of Tan IIA on various human cancer cells, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Tan IIA's apoptotic effects on leukemia cells in vitro.The cytotoxicity of Tan IIA on different types of leukemia cell lines was evaluated by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5]-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on cells treated without or with Tan IIA at different concentrations for different time periods. Cellular apoptosis progression with and without Tan IIA treatment was analyzed by Annexin V and Caspase 3 assays. Gene expression profiling was used to identify the genes regulated after Tan IIA treatment and those differentially expressed among the five cell lines. Confirmation of these expression regulations was carried out using real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. The antagonizing effect of a PXR inhibitor L-SFN on Tan IIA treatment was tested using Colony Forming Unit Assay.Our results revealed that Tan IIA had different cytotoxic activities on five types of leukemia cells, with the highest toxicity on U-937 cells. Tan IIA inhibited the growth of U-937 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Annexin V and Caspase-3 assays showed that Tan IIA induced apoptosis in U-937 cells. Using gene expression profiling, 366 genes were found to be significantly regulated after Tan IIA treatment and differentially expressed among the five cell lines. Among these genes, CCL2 was highly expressed in untreated U-937 cells and down-regulated significantly after Tan IIA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. RT-qPCR analyses validated the expression regulation of 80% of genes. Addition of L-sulforaphane (L-SFN), an inhibitor of Pregnane×receptor (PXR) significantly attenuated Tan IIA's effects using colony forming assays.Tan IIA has significant growth inhibition effects on U-937 cells through the induction of apoptosis. And Tan IIA-induced apoptosis might result from the activation of PXR, which suppresses the activity of NF-κB and lead to the down-regulation of CCL2 expression."
2007,17360885,Low serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol in human diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis by Leishmania mexicana.,"Low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol hormones produced by the suprarenal cortex have been associated with diseases involving chronic inflammation, low interferon (IFN)-gamma, and high interleukin (IL)-6. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DL), a long-lasting intracellular parasitic infectious disease, can spread unknown levels of DHEA and cortisol. Serum concentrations of both were measured in 5 patients with DL, in 15 patients with localized lesions produced by Leishmania (LL), and in 20 healthy volunteers. Leishmania mexicana mexicana was identified as the causal agent in patients with DL and LL. Hormone levels were lower in DL compared with controls and LL. Furthermore, we detected a lower percentage of IFN-gamma-positive cells with higher levels of IL-6 and higher titers of anti-Leishmania antibodies in patients with DL, whereas patients with LL were similar to controls. These data suggest that patients with DL may be good candidates for DHEA and cortisol supplementation."
2018,29421579,Polyphenol-enriched extract of Rosa rugosa Thunb regulates lipid metabolism in diabetic rats by activation of AMPK pathway.,"This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of polyphenol-enriched extract of Rosa rugosa Thunb (RPE) in the control of dyslipidemia in diabetic rats. RPE was tested at three dosages (37.5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) in the rat dyslipidemia model established with high fat diet feeding in combination with STZ injection (30 mg/kg). The RPE effect was evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment. In the RPE-treated rats, hepatic total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were significantly reduced, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and liver lipase (HL) were significantly increased. The levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were decreased in the serum. Those effects of RPE were observed primarily at the mediate and high dosages. Expression of FGF21 was increased in the liver tissue and hepatic cell line 1c1c7 by RPE. The signals of p-AMPK, p-ACC, ACC, p-SIRT, and PGC-1α were significantly induced in the liver by RPE. The results suggest that RPE may improve hepatic steatosis and liver function by induction of AMPK signaling activity in the control of dyslipidemia."
2007,17182007,Protective effect of baicalein against endotoxic shock in rats in vivo and in vitro.,"Dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang qin) are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Baicalein is a major bioactive flavonoid component of H. qin that shows a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We evaluated therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of action of baicalein on circulatory failure and vascular dysfunction during sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg, i.v.) in anesthetized rats. Treatment of the rats with baicalein (20 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly attenuated the deleterious hemodynamic changes of hypotension and tachycardia caused by LPS and significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Baicalein also decreased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the overproduction of NO and superoxide anions caused by LPS. It also increased the survival rate of ICR mice (25-30 g) challenged by LPS (60 mg/kg). Moreover, infiltration of neutrophils into the liver and lungs of rats 6h after treatment with LPS was also reduced by baicalein. To investigate the mechanism of action of baicalein on sepsis, RAW 264.7 cells were used as a model. Baicalein inhibited iNOS protein production, and suppressed LPS-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha, the formation of a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)-DNA complex and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. Thus, the therapeutic effects of baicalein were associated with reductions in TNF-alpha and superoxide anion levels during sepsis. The inhibitory effects of baicalein on iNOS production may be mediated by inhibition of the activation of NF-kappaB. Baicalein may thus prove a potential agent against endotoxemia."
2012,22222820,Carbocisteine promotes phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by alveolar macrophages.,"Clearance of apoptotic cells, so-called efferocytosis, by alveolar macrophages (AMs) is important for lung homeostasis and is impaired in pulmonary inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Carbocisteine, a mucoregulatory drug, corrects the contents of fucose in airway mucus and has anti-inflammatory properties in airway inflammation. Thus, we conducted the present study to better understand the anti-inflammatory properties of carbocisteine. First, we induced airway inflammation in mice with lipopolysaccharide intratracheally. Carbocisteine significantly decreased neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the resolution phase of inflammation, implying the promotion of neutrophil clearance. Then, we investigated whether carbocisteine would enhance the efferocytosis by AMs isolated from mice and found that this drug promoted not only the phagocytosis but also the binding of apoptotic cells to AMs in vitro. Furthermore, carbocisteine decreased the fucose residues stained with fluorescent fucose-binding lectin, Lens culinaris agglutinin, on the cell surface of AMs. We found here that removing fucose residues from cell surfaces of AMs by fucosidase markedly enhanced both the binding and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Finally, AMs from mice orally given carbocisteine also promoted both the binding and phagocytosis ex vivo similarly to in vitro. These results suggest that carbocisteine could promote the clearance of apoptotic cells by AMs in airway. In addition, the present findings suggest that the binding and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells may be modulated by fucose residues on the cell surface of AMs."
2015,26013395,"Chromium Supplements in the Feed for Lactating Murrah Buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis): Influence on Nutrient Utilization, Lactation Performance, and Metabolic Responses.","This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different levels of inorganic chromium (Cr) on nutrient intake, nutrient utilization, milk mineral contents, and blood biochemical in lactating Murrah buffaloes. Twenty-four multifarious Murrah buffaloes were blocked into four groups having six animals in each group and fed for 150 days post-partum. Feeding regimen was same in all the groups except that treatment groups were supplemented with 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg inorganic Cr/kg dry matter (DM) in the four respective groups. Group fed on basal diet supplemented with 0.0 mg Cr/kg DM served as a control. Adding inorganic Cr to the diet of lactating buffaloes increased feed intake, milk yield, and nutrient digestibility. Nitrogen (N) and Cr balance were significantly increased (P<0.05) by adding Cr. Milk and plasma Cr concentration could be increased by adding Cr (P<0.001), while no significant differences were found between the four treatments in milk and plasma concentration of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). Feeding of diet supplemented with inorganic Cr decreased plasma insulin concentration (P=0.016). Concentration of blood glucose and the ratio of blood glucose to insulin were increased by adding Cr (P=0.037 and P=0.011, respectively). Adding Cr to the diet of lactating buffaloes did not show any effect on blood hemoglobin (Hb), while plasma concentration of progesterone and antioxidant status was increased (P<0.05). It could be concluded that adding Cr to the diet of lactating buffaloes improved nutrient intake, nutrient utilization, and lactation performance."
2017,28711658,"Betulinic acid, isolated from the leaves of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels, ameliorates the proteinuria in experimental membranous nephropathy through regulating Nrf2/NF-κB pathways.","Membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the kidney. Betulinic acid (BA) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound isolated from the leaves of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BA on experimental MN in rats and explored the mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammatory condition in experimental MN. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single tail vein injection of anti- Fx1A antiserum. The rats were orally administered BA (25 and 50 mg kg -1 d -1) or dexamethasone (DEX; 0.07 mg kg-1, reference compound) for 4 weeks after the induction of PHN. Blood, urine, and kidney tissue were collected for analysis at the end of the study. Treatment of PHN rats with BA or DEX significantly attenuated renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations and reduced immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, BA ameliorated mRNA and protein expression of NF-κB, iNOS, TNF-α, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the kidney. BA also restored malondialdehyde level and antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney. In a nutshell, the protective effect of BA can be explained by its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, which in turn is due to downregulation of NF-κB pathway and activation of Nrf2. The results indicated that BA can effectively suppress experimental PHN in rats by regulating Nrf2/NF-κB pathways."
2018,30021911,Serum Sex Steroids as Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Post Hoc Analysis of the PR.7 Trial.,"Purpose: Phenotypic biomarkers are a high priority for patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer given the increasing number of treatment options. This study evaluates serum sex steroids as prognostic biomarkers in men receiving ADT for recurrent prostate cancer.Experimental Design: Retrospective cohort study of Canadian patients in the PR.7 trial (accrual 1999-2005) who received continuous ADT for biochemical recurrence postradiotherapy. Patients were excluded with follow-up <2 years or who received estrogens or corticosteroids. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for baseline prognostic factors assessed time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), prostate cancer survival, and overall survival according to tertile of sex steroid measured by mass spectrometry.Results: Post-ADT initiation, we measured samples in 219 patients as well as two subsequent annual samples in a subset of 101 patients. Testosterone levels correlated with androstenedione (AD) and DHT, while DHT, AD, androsterone (AST), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenediol (A5diol) were highly correlated to each other and negatively associated with age. Higher tertiles of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were significantly associated with sooner time to CRPC. In patients with longitudinal samples, increases in serum DHEA and AST were significantly associated with sooner time to CRPC. Limitations include the number of events for some groups.Conclusions: Our data suggest the patient hormonal milieu has long-term prognostic value in men receiving ADT for recurrent prostate cancer, including increased levels of E1 and E2 and rising DHEA and AST levels, which predict a shorter time to CRPC.

2007,17223855,Effects of clarithromycin and grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide.,"Case reports suggest that clarithromycin can increase the glucose-lowering effect of glibenclamide which is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein and OATP2B1. Our objective was to evaluate whether the P-glycoprotein inhibitor, clarithromycin, increases and the putative OATP2B1 inhibitor, grapefruit juice, decreases plasma concentrations of glibenclamide.In a randomized three-phase crossover study, 12 subjects ingested 250 mg clarithromycin or placebo twice daily or 200 ml grapefruit juice three times daily for 2 days. On day 3, they ingested 0.875 mg glibenclamide with sugar water or grapefruit juice. Concentrations of glibenclamide and clarithromycin in plasma, glucose in blood, and excretion of hydroxy-glibenclamide into urine were measured up to 12 h.Clarithromycin increased the peak concentration (C(max)) of glibenclamide to 1.25-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.40; P < 0.01) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 1.35-fold (95% CI 1.21, 1.50; P < 0.01) compared with the placebo phase. The time to C(max), the half-life of glibenclamide, and the amount of hydroxy-glibenclamide excreted into urine remained unaltered. Grapefruit juice did not change the pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide. Clarithromycin concentrations implied a good compliance. Blood glucose did not deviate between the phases.Clarithromycin increased plasma concentrations of glibenclamide, possibly by inhibiting P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall. Although not seen with the present study design, clarithromycin may enhance the effect of glibenclamide by increasing plasma glibenclamide concentrations, which warrants close monitoring of blood glucose during their co-administration. Grapefruit juice had no effect on glibenclamide pharmacokinetics."
2012,22566762,Acid-base chemistry of white wine: analytical characterisation and chemical modelling.,"A chemical model of the acid-base properties is optimized for each white wine under study, together with the calculation of their ionic strength, taking into account the contributions of all significant ionic species (strong electrolytes and weak one sensitive to the chemical equilibria). Coupling the HPLC-IEC and HPLC-RP methods, we are able to quantify up to 12 carboxylic acids, the most relevant substances responsible of the acid-base equilibria of wine. The analytical concentration of carboxylic acids and of other acid-base active substances was used as input, with the total acidity, for the chemical modelling step of the study based on the contemporary treatment of overlapped protonation equilibria. New protonation constants were refined (L-lactic and succinic acids) with respect to our previous investigation on red wines. Attention was paid for mixed solvent (ethanol-water mixture), ionic strength, and temperature to ensure a thermodynamic level to the study. Validation of the chemical model optimized is achieved by way of conductometric measurements and using a synthetic ""wine"" especially adapted for testing."
,8615595,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of carboranyl uridines as boron delivery agents for neutron capture therapy.,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate 2' and 5'-O-(o-carboran-1-ylmethyl)uridine (CBU-2' and CBU-5') as delivery agents for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) of brain tumors. The in vitro cellular uptake, persistence, subcellular distribution and cytotoxicity, and in vivo biodistribution of CBU-2' have been studied as follows. Cellular uptake studies were carried out with the F98 rat glioma, U-87 MG human glioma, B16 melanoma, SP2/0 myeloma and MDCK fibroblasts. All tumor and non-tumor cell lines had high uptake of CBU-2' (46-75 ppm), indicating that uptake was not selective for neoplastic cells and was independent of cell proliferation. In vitro persistence studies showed high cellular retention of CBU-2' compared to sodium borocaptate (BSH), when cells were transferred from boron-containing to boron-free medium and cultured for an additional 24-48 hours. Subcellular fractionation revealed 75.6% of the recoverable boron was cell membrane associated, 15.6% was in the cytosol, and 8.8% was in the nuclear fraction, but no boron was detectable in the RNA and DNA fractions. F98 glioma cells were cultured in the presence of 3 metabolic inhibitors (rotenone, dipyridamole and NBMPR ¿6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine¿) and none of these blocked the cellular uptake of CBU-2' suggesting that uptake was neither energy nor nucleoside transport dependent. In vivo studies in F98 glioma bearing rats showed that CBU-2' in tumor attained concentrations of 8.0 +/- 2.1 micrograms B/g tissue, which was 13 x greater than that in normal brain of the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres (0.6 +/- 0.2 microgram B/g). The B levels, however, were still lower than the minimum 20-35 microgram B/g, which are required for in vivo BNCT. In summary, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that CBU-2' was not sufficiently selective for in vivo targeting of brain tumors. However, CBU-2' and CBU-5' were highly toxic for F98 glioma cells in vitro (IC50 = 3 - 13 x 10(-5) M), as determined by measuring the uptake of 3H-thymidine, and the survival of F98 glioma cells using a clonogenic assay, which suggests that these compounds should be further evaluated as potential cytoreductive chemotherapeutic agents."
2018,29990845,Amelioration of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment by Lemon oil in experimental model of Stressed mice.,"Citrous lemon (Rutaceae) an Indian folk medicine has been used for the treatment of various pathological diseases viz., diabetes, cardiovascular, inflammation, hepatobiliary dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorder. Can lemon oil altered the memory of unstressed and stressed mice, a basic question for which the present work was put on trial. The present investigation was intended to assess the impact of Lemon oil on memory of unstressed and Stressed Swiss young Albino mice. Lemon oil (50 and 100 mg/kg o.r.) and donepezil (10 mg/kg) were guided for three weeks to different groups of stressed and unstressed mice. The nootropic movement was assessed utilizing elevated plus maze and Hebbs Williams Maze. Cerebrum acetylcholinesterase (AChE), plasmacorticosterone, decreased glutathione, lipid per oxidation alongside superoxide dismutase and catalase was surveyed as marker for disease. Histopathology was performed for estimation of drug effects. Acute immobilized stress was induce, lemon oil (100 mg/kg) and donepezil together indicated memory enhancing movement both in stressed and unstressed mice. Lemon oil significantly (p < 0.001) altered and lowered brain AChE activity both in stressed and unstressed mice. Scopolamine induced amnesia was also significantly altered and reversed both in stressed and unstressed mice by lemon oil at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg. Lemon oil (50 and 100 mg/kg) was further able to control the corticosterone level in plasma for stressed mice. Lemon oil significantly (p < 0.001) elevated the level of catalase, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione levels both in stressed and unstressed animals with respect to controlled group along with TBARS both in stressed and unstressed compared with control group. Hence it can be concluded that memory enhancing activity might be related to reduction in AChE and TBARS activity and by elevated GSH, SOD and catalase through decrease in raised plasma corticosterone levels."
2009,21785655,Possible fenugreek induced haemolysis in a patient with previously unknown G6PD deficiency.,"Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common disease producing enzymopathy. People with G6PD deficiency cannot cope with oxidative stressors. These patients are asymptomatic until they develop a haemolytic crisis which presents as anaemia and jaundice. The agents known to cause haemolysis in these patients are: oxidant drugs, (primaquine, chloroquine and other anti-malarials), antibiotics, (chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, sulphonamides, and all quinolone antibiotics). Chemicals to be avoided are moth balls (napththalene), aniline dyes, and some Chinese herbal medicine (San Chi, Chuan Lian). The classic presentation of exposure to Fava beans (legumes), causing oxidative haemolysis, has led G6PD deficiency to be also known as Favism. The patient we present here had no exposure to any of the known causes of oxidative haemolysis. Instead his precipitating cause strongly suggests raw fenugreek (T foenum-graecum L), a legume used as a herbal treatment for diabetes and previously not known to be a precipitant of haemolysis in G6PD deficiency."
2011,21620824,Resveratrol prevents bradykinin-induced contraction of rat urinary bladders by decreasing prostaglandin production and calcium influx.,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in grapes and peanuts, exerts beneficial effects on a number of diseases of cardiovascular and central nervous system. However, effects of resveratrol on the urinary system have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we examined effects of resveratrol on bradykinin-induced contraction and release of prostaglandin E2 in isolated rat urinary bladders. The effects of resveratrol on contractions induced by several agonists (prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α and carbachol) and high K+ were also examined. We found that resveratrol concentration-dependently reduced the bradykinin-induced contraction in the rat urinary bladder preparations. The higher concentration of resveratrol (100 μM) abolished the bradykinin-induced prostaglandin E2 release. Similar results were obtained when the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μM) was used instead of resveratrol. Resveratrol also attenuated the prostaglandin E2-, prostaglandin F2α-, and to a lesser extent carbachol-induced contractions. Contractile responses to bradykinin, prostaglandin E2 and carbachol were largely prevented by blockade of Ca2+ channels with diltiazem. Both resveratrol and diltiazem prevented contractions induced by an addition of Ca2+ (2.5- 10 mM) into Ca2+-free/50 mMK+ solution or by 50 mMK+ solution containing normal Ca2+ (2.5 mM). These results suggest that resveratrol prevents bradykinin-induced contractions by attenuating not only the production of prostaglandins but also actions of them. The effect of resveratrol on contractile actions seems to be in part due to inhibition of Ca2+ influx. Because bradykinin plays an important role in pathological conditions of urinary bladder function, resveratrol may exert beneficial effects on the urinary bladder diseases."
2018,29091859,Vitexin inhibits inflammation in murine ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma.,"Vitexin is an important component of various medicinal plants frequently used to treat asthma, such as Crataegus spp., Vitex spp., Passiflora spp., and Echinodorus spp. However, there is no information about the vitexin potential as anti-asthmatic. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the anti-hypersensitive activity of vitexin in a murine ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma model. Mice were sensitized to OVA by i.p. injection on days 1st and 10th, followed by a daily challenge with OVA using a nebulizer, from days 19th to 24th. Vitexin or dexamethasone were orally administered 1h before each OVA challenge. Vitexin attenuates migration induced by OVA-hypersensitivity of eosinophil, neutrophil, and mononuclear cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Histological analysis of the lungs shows that vitexin suppressed leukocyte infiltration, mucus production and pulmonary edema. Increases in Th2 cytokines in BALF in OVA-induced asthma is also attenuated by vitexin, as well as plasma levels of IgE. Overall, these results suggest that vitexin can suppress OVA-induced allergic inflammation in mice and provide a strong rationale for further developing vitexin as a candidate treatment for allergic hypersensitivity. These data corroborate the popular use of vitexin-rich plants for asthma treatment."
2005,15930730,Beneficial effects of Momordica charantia seeds in the treatment of STZ-induced diabetes in experimental rats.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the aqueous extract of seeds of two varieties, namely a country and hybrid variety of Momordica charantia (MCSEt1 and MCSEt2) on oxidative stress in plasma and pancreas of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of each of the seed extracts at a dosage of 150 mg/kg body weight for 30 d resulted in a significant reduction in plasma glucose, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, lipid-hydroperoxides, alpha-tocopherol and significant improvement in ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione and insulin. The treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid-hydroperoxides, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and significant improvement in reduced glutathione in pancreas of drug treated diabetic rats when compared to the untreated diabetic rats. On the basis of results obtained, it may be concluded that the treatment of Momordica charantia seed varieties may effectively normalize the impaired oxidative stress in streptozotocin induced-diabetes than the glibenclamide treated groups."
2015,26314315,Black elderberry extract attenuates inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice.,"Dietary anthocyanins have been shown to reduce inflammation in animal models and may ameliorate obesity-related complications. Black elderberry is one of the richest sources of anthocyanins. We investigated the metabolic effects of anthocyanin-rich black elderberry extract (BEE) in a diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mouse model. Mice were fed either a low-fat diet (n 8), high-fat lard-based diet (HFD; n 16), HFD+0·25 % (w/w) BEE (0·25 %-BEE; n 16) or HFD+1·25 % BEE (1·25 %-BEE; n 16) for 16 weeks. The 0·25 % BEE (0·034 % anthocyanin, w/w) and 1·25 % BEE (0·17 % anthocyanin, w/w) diets corresponded to estimated anthocyanin doses of 20-40 mg and 100-200 mg per kg of body weight, respectively. After 16 weeks, both BEE groups had significantly lower liver weights, serum TAG, homoeostasis model assessment and serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 compared with HFD. The 0·25 %-BEE also had lower serum insulin and TNFα compared with HFD. Hepatic fatty acid synthase mRNA was lower in both BEE groups, whereas PPARγ2 mRNA and liver cholesterol were lower in 1·25 %-BEE, suggesting decreased hepatic lipid synthesis. Higher adipose PPARγ mRNA, transforming growth factor β mRNA and adipose tissue histology suggested a pro-fibrogenic phenotype that was less inflammatory in 1·25 %-BEE. Skeletal muscle mRNA expression of the myokine IL-6 was higher in 0·25 %-BEE relative to HFD. These results suggest that BEE may have improved some metabolic disturbances present in this mouse model of obesity by lowering serum TAG, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance. "
2012,29243623,Profiling of in vitro neurobiological effects and phenolic acids of selected endemic Salvia species.,"The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from 16 Salvia L. species were screened for their inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, lipoxygenase, and tyrosinase; the enzymes linked to neurodegeneration. Their antioxidant activity was also tested using DPPH radical scavenging, metal-chelation, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Total flavonoid content of the extracts was determined by AlCl3 reagent, while HPLC technique was applied for analysis of various phenolic acids in the extracts. The extracts exerted weak cholinesterase and tyrosinase inhibition, and remarkable inhibition against lipoxygenase (13.07±2.73-74.21±5.61%) at 100μgml-1. The methanol extracts showed higher antioxidant activity in DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP assays. The extracts were analyzed for their gallic, protocateuchic, p-hydroxy-benzoic, vanillic, caffeic, chlorogenic, syringic, o- and p-coumaric, ferulic, rosmarinic, and tr-cinnamic acid contents and the methanol extract of Salvia ekimiana (153.50mg100g-1) was revealed to be the richest in terms of rosmarinic acid."
2013,23778903,Clinical outcomes with rivaroxaban in patients transitioned from vitamin K antagonist therapy: a subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.,"In ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), a large randomized, clinical trial, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.To determine the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin among vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-naive and VKA-experienced patients.Prespecified subgroup analysis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00403767).Global.14,264 persons with atrial fibrillation.Interaction of the relative treatment effect of rivaroxaban and warfarin on stroke or systemic embolism among VKA-naive and VKA-experienced patients.Overall, 7897 (55.4%) patients were VKA-experienced and 6367 (44.6%) were VKA-naive. The effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on stroke or systemic embolism was consistent: Rates per 100 patient-years of follow-up were 2.32 versus 2.87 for VKA-naive patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.03]) and 1.98 versus 2.09 for VKA-experienced patients (HR, 0.94 [CI, 0.75 to 1.18]; interaction P = 0.36). During the first 7 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more bleeding than warfarin (HR in VKA-naive patients, 5.83 [CI, 3.25 to 10.44], and in VKA-experienced patients, 6.66 [CI, 3.83 to 11.58]; interaction P = 0.53). After 30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with less bleeding than warfarin in VKA-naive patients (HR, 0.84 [CI, 0.74 to 0.95]) and similar bleeding in VKA-experienced patients (HR, 1.06 [CI, 0.96 to 1.17]; interaction P = 0.003).The trial was not designed to detect differences in these subgroups.The efficacy of rivaroxaban in VKA-experienced and VKA-naive patients was similar to that of the overall trial. There were more bleeding events within 7 days of study drug initiation with rivaroxaban, but after 30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with less bleeding in VKA-naive patients and similar bleeding in VKA-experienced patients. This information may be useful to clinicians considering a transition to rivaroxaban for patients receiving VKA therapy.Johnson & Johnson and Bayer HealthCare."
2018,29847745,Antiviral Activity of Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) Skin Extract Against Human Influenza Viruses.,"The high propensity of influenza viruses to develop resistance to antiviral drugs necessitates the continuing search for new therapeutics. Peanut skins, which are low-value byproducts of the peanut industry, are known to contain high levels of polyphenols. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of ethanol extracts of peanut skins against various influenza viruses using cell-based assays. Extracts with a higher polyphenol content exhibited higher antiviral activities, suggesting that the active components are the polyphenols. An extract prepared from roasted peanut skins effectively inhibited the replication of influenza virus A/WSN/33 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.3 μg/mL. Plaque assay results suggested that the extract inhibits the early replication stages of the influenza virus. It demonstrated activity against both influenza type A and type B viruses. Notably, the extract exhibited a potent activity against a clinical isolate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which had reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir. Moreover, a combination of peanut skin extract with the anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and amantadine, synergistically increased their antiviral activity. These data demonstrate the potential application of peanut skin extract in the development of new therapeutic options for influenza management."
2017,28506909,The selective effect of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid on topoisomerase IIα and apoptosis in combination with etoposide on triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.,"Triple negative breast cancer(TNBC) has generated growing interests due to its aggressive biologic behavior and absence of targeted therapy approach. Glycyrrhizin(GL) from licorice root and its metabolite, glycyrrhetinic acid(GA) have shown extensive bioactivities in clinic. Here, we demonstrate that GL and GA have contrary anti-cancer effect on TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. Beside its inhibition of cell proliferation, GA at non-cytotoxic concentration showed synergistic effect in combination with anti-cancer drug, etoposide(VP-16). Specifically, GA enhanced cytotoxicity through regulating topoisomerase IIα(TOPO 2A) targeted by etoposide. GA sensitized the cells to etoposide through elevating TOPO 2A with a 2.4 fold rate at 12h. From 12 to 48h, GA halved the expression of TOPO 2A and stimulated apoptosis, which exhibited its antineoplastic effect. Our experiments showed that GSH depletion, modulation of MAPK and AKT pathways accounted for the regulation of topoisomerase IIα and apoptosis. However, GL showed protection and detoxication by decreasing reactive oxygen species generation, maintaining GSH and differentially modulating apoptosis, AKT pathway, ERK and JNK of MAPK pathway. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GA, instead of GL, is a better candidate for TNBC treatment because of its anti-cancer effect and sensitization of topoisomerase IIα inhibitor."
2018,28873565,The betaine profile of cereal flours unveils new and uncommon betaines.,"We report the LC-ESI-MS/MS determination of betaines in commercial flours of cereals and pseudocereals most utilized in human nutrition. Results showed that glycine betaine, trigonelline, proline betaine, Nε-trimethyllysine were metabolites common to all examined flours, whereas an uncommon betaine, valine betaine, and glutamine betaine were present only in flours of barley, rye, oat, durum wheat, winter wheat, Triticum dicoccum and Triticum monococcum. Valine betaine and glutamine betaine, the latter never reported before in plants and animals, are not evenly distributed in the Poaceae family, but their presence or absence in flours depends on the subfamily to which the plant belongs. Interestingly, we also report for the first time the occurrence of pipecolic acid betaine (homostachydrine) and its precursor 1,2-N-methylpipecolic acid in rye flour. These two metabolites were not detected in any other cereal or pseudocereal flour, suggesting their potential role as markers of rye flour occurrence in cereal-based foods."
1994,7702362,Effect of fish oil treatment on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.,"The effect of fish oil on gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was investigated in rats. Gentamicin (80 mg/kg/day intramuscularly for 6 days) produced the typical pattern of nephrotoxicity as shown by increases in serum creatinine and urea concentrations, and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and proximal renal tubular necrosis. Fish oil (5.0 ml/kg/kday per os for 10 days) partially protected against the nephrotoxicity induced by gentamicin administered during the last 6 days of treatment with fish oil by returning the creatinine and urea concentrations and NAG activity to normal and by ameliorating the histopathological damage. Olive oil (5 mg/kg/day per os for 10 days) was ineffective in protecting rats against gentamicin nephrotoxicity."
2018,29481770,Amelioration effect of Egyptian sweet orange hesperidin on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice.,"There are global increased interests to identify novel agents that can possess anti-tumor effects or maximize the anti-tumor effects of low doses for conventional anti-cancer drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tumor effects and protective role of isolated hesperidin from sweet orange on doxorubicin-induced toxicity in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice. Tumor cells were injected into Swiss albino mice followed by hesperidin administration either alone or in combination with doxorubicin. Biochemical parameters on serum and hepatic were measured. In addition, the effect of hesperidin on apoptotic genes (Caspase3 and Bax) and anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl2) on tumor cells were evaluated by RT- PCR. The results showed that addition of hesperidin to doxorubicin-induced higher anti-tumor responses than treatment with hesperidin or doxorubicin alone. Hesperidin and doxorubicin in combination prolonged the life span of EAC tumor-bearing mice which was associated with a decrease in the number of viable tumor cells and increases in dead tumor cells number. In addition, co-administration of hesperidin with doxorubicin ameliorated the alteration in serum ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and LDH activities, total protein, albumin, creatinine, urea and total lipids concentrations. Moreover, hesperidin alone and in combination with doxorubicin-treated group decreased hepatic, TBARS level significantly as compared with tumor bearing mice and doxorubicin treated group. In contrast, hesperidin alone and combined with doxorubicin ameliorated total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione level, and antioxidant enzymes activities such as GPx and CAT in liver tissues. Moreover, hesperidin induced apoptosis of tumor cells which appeared as DNA fragmentation by down-regulation of Bcl2 as anti-apoptotic gene and stimulation of Caspase3 and Bax genes expression as apoptotic genes. In conclusion, Egyptian citrus peels are a rich source of the antioxidant hesperidin. Moreover, it can ameliorate the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin while enhancing its anti-tumor effect."
2019,31412862,Berberine inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome pathway in human triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell.,"Breast cancer is still the most common malignant tumor that threatens the female's life in the world, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most difficult subtypes. Lack of targeted therapies brings about urgent demand for novel treatments. In this study we aim to investigate the anti-tumor activity of Berberine (BBR), a Chinese plant-derived alkaloid, against the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 and elucidate its mechanism referring to anti-inflammation.Cell inhibition rate was measured by Cell Proliferation Assay, the cytotoxic effects was detected by Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay, the colony formation and migration potential were evaluated by colony formation assay and wound healing assay, the release of inflammatory cytokines was detected by EMD multifactor detection, and alterations of proteins and genes related to the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway were analyzed using western blotting and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).BBR reduce the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells and increased the release of LDH from the cells in a dose-dependent manner, with and inhibition of colony formation potential and migration of the cells. BBR also caused a marked reduction in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-1α (IL-1α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Besides, a down-regulated behavior was observed with the expression of P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7), NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation and recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1 p20, Interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-1β proteins and NLRP3, Caspase-1 and ASC mRNAs in the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade.Our results confirmed that BBR can effectively affect both tumor outgrowth and spontaneous metastasis in TNBC, and that we identified a new mechanism associated with inhibition the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, suggesting its potential therapeutic relevance in clinical use."
2010,21048310,Dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans from Forsythia koreana fruits attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced inducible nitric oxide synthetase and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions through activation of nuclear factor-κb and mitogen-activated protein kinase in RAW264.7 cells.,"Previously, we reported that dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans (DBLLs) from the fruit of Forsythia koreana NAKAI (Oleaceae) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-asthmatic effects. In this study, to clarify the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of DBLL, we evaluated the effects of DBLLs on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions, nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) productions, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activations, inhibitor of κB (IκB) and inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) phosphorylations in cytosolic proteins, and cytotoxicity in Raw264.7 cells. DBLLs potently suppressed both the enzyme expression and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Arctiin, arctigenin (1.0 µM) and matairesinol (10 µM) inhibited the expression of iNOS by 37.71±2.86%, 32.51±4.28%, and 27.44±2.65%, respectively, and arctiin, arctigenin (0.1 µM) and matairesinol (1.0 µM) inhibited COX-2 expression by 37.93±7.81%, 26.70±4.61% and 29.37±5.21%, respectively. The inhibitory effects of DBLLs on NO and PGE(2) productions were the same patterns as those seen for the reductions in iNOS and COX-2 expression, respectively. Arctiin, arctigenin (1.0 µM) and matairesinol (10 µM) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited NF-κB DNA binding by 44.85±6.67%, 44.16±6.61%, and 44.79±5.62%, respectively, and arctiin (0.1 µM) and arctigenin (1.0 µM) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB by 20.58±3.86% and 25.99±6.18%, respectively. Furthermore, arctiin, matairesinol (1.0 µM) and arctigenin (10 µM) inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK by 38.80±6.64%, 38.33±6.65%, and 38.57±8.14%, respectively. In addition, DBLLs potently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of MAPKs (SAPK/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase (ERK)1/2). Overall, arctiin was the most effective; its effect was nearly the same as that of 10 µM helenalin. These findings suggest that treatment with non-toxic DBLLs inhibits not only NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated protein activation, but also potently inhibits the activations of specific MAPKs."
1999,10233375,"Vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) administered as rapid intravenous infusion for first-line treatment in untreated multiple myeloma.","We examined the feasibility of achieving a rapid response in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma by administering vincristine 0.4 mg and doxorubicin 9 mg/m2 as a rapid intravenous infusion for 4 d together with intermittent high-dose dexamethasone 40 mg (VAD) for remission induction treatment in patients who were scheduled to receive high-dose therapy. 139 patients (86 male, 53 female; median age 53 years, range 32-65 years; Durie & Salmon stage IIA: 42, IIB: one, IIIA: 89, IIIB: seven) were included in a prospective multicentre study in which VAD was administered as remission induction treatment and was followed by intensified treatment. The response was evaluated according to the criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). The results of treatment were evaluable in 134 patients. Five patients died before evaluation. 86 patients (62%) achieved a partial response (PR) and seven patients (5%) achieved a complete response (CR), which equates to a response rate of 67%. The main side-effect was mild neurotoxicity, which was observed in 18% of the patients. Fever or infections were reported in 27% of the patients. VAD administered as an outpatient regimen, based on rapid intravenous infusion, is an effective induction regimen for untreated myeloma with a 67% response rate and acceptable toxicity."
2011,21554814,Ruminal methane inhibition potential of various pure compounds in comparison with garlic oil as determined with a rumen simulation technique (Rusitec).,"Ruminants represent an important source of methane (CH(4)) emissions; therefore, CH(4) mitigation by diet supplementation is a major goal in the current ruminant research. The objective of the present study was to use a rumen simulation technique to evaluate the CH(4)-mitigating potential of pure compounds in comparison with that achieved with garlic oil, a known anti-methanogenic supplement. A basal diet (15 g DM/d) consisting of ryegrass hay, barley and soyabean meal (1:0·7:0·3) was incubated with the following additives: none (negative control); garlic oil (300 mg/l incubation liquid; positive control); allyl isothiocyanate (75 mg/l); lovastatin (150 mg/l); chenodeoxycholic acid (150 mg/l); 3-azido-propionic acid ethyl ester (APEE, 150 mg/l); levulinic acid (300 mg/l); 4-[(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-benzoic acid (PABA, 300 mg/l). Fermentation profiles (SCFA, microbial counts and N turnover) and H(2) and CH(4) formation were determined. Garlic oil, allyl isothiocyanate, lovastatin and the synthetic compound APEE decreased the absolute daily CH(4) formation by 91, 59, 42 and 98 %, respectively. The corresponding declines in CH(4) emitted per mmol of SCFA were 87, 32, 40 and 99 %, respectively, compared with the negative control; the total SCFA concentration was unaffected. Garlic oil decreased protozoal numbers and increased bacterial counts, while chenodeoxycholic acid completely defaunated the incubation liquid. In vitro, neutral-detergent fibre disappearance was lower following chenodeoxycholic acid and PABA treatments (- 26 and - 18 %, respectively). In conclusion, garlic oil and APEE were extremely efficient at mitigating CH(4) without noticeably impairing microbial nutrient fermentation. Other promising substances were allyl isothiocyanate and lovastatin."
2009,19190248,Adverse events among 2408 unrelated donors of peripheral blood stem cells: results of a prospective trial from the National Marrow Donor Program.,"Limited data are available describing donor adverse events (AEs) associated with filgrastim mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections in unrelated volunteers. We report results in 2408 unrelated PBSC donors prospectively evaluated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) between 1999 and 2004. Female donors had higher rates of AEs, requiring central line placement more often (17% vs 4%, P< .001), experiencing more apheresis-related AEs (20% vs 7%, P< .001), more bone pain (odds ratio [OR]=1.49), and higher rates of grades II-IV and III-IV CALGB AEs (OR=2.22 and 2.32). Obese donors experienced more bone pain (obese vs normal, OR=1.73) and heavy donors had higher rates of CALGB toxicities (>95 kg vs <70 kg, OR=1.49). Six percent of donors experienced grade III-IV CALGB toxicities and 0.6% experienced toxicities that were considered serious and unexpected. Complete recovery is universal, however, and no late AEs attributable to donation have been identified. In conclusion, PBSC collection in unrelated donors is generally safe, but nearly all donors will experience bone pain, 1 in 4 will have significant headache, nausea, or citrate toxicity, and a small percentage will experience serious short-term adverse events. In addition, women and larger donors are at higher risk for donation-related AEs."
1989,2801758,Very low dose danazol in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and its role as an immune modulator.,"Danazol, an attenuated androgen, has been used successfully at its conventional dose (400-800 mg/day) in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). To minimize side effects, the authors tried a very low dose (50 mg/day) regimen which has not been used in any other disease and observed its efficacy in ITP. Fifteen patients were given this dosage of danazol. Its effects on T-cell subsets, B cells, and blastogenic response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) were studied before and during therapy. The percentage of CD3 and the percentage and numbers of CD4 were significantly increased during therapy. Responses to PWM, a T-cell dependent B cell mitogen, were also significantly elevated during therapy. However, no change in the percentage of B (CD19) lymphocytes and response to Staph A, a polyclonal B cell mitogen, were noted. There were seven excellent-good and eight fair-poor responses in platelet counts. The excellent-good responders were found to have a more stable CD4 subset between before and during therapy compared to the fair-poor responders (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Very low dose danazol regimen, therefore, produced a significant increase in the CD4 without affecting the B cells. However, the excellent-good responder patients showed no significant increase in the CD4 lymphocytes."
2002,12203138,Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism associates with graft-versus-host disease and survival in HLA-matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.,"We investigated the role of polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in HLA-matched sibling BMT for polymorphisms previously associated with human disease pathology. In intron 8 of the VDR gene, the B and A alleles of the BsmI and ApaI RFLPs were found to associate with reduced aGVHD when present in the patient's genotype. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that patient VDR genotype, along with previously identified IL-10(-1064) and IFN-gamma genotype to be risk factors for severe acute GVHD. The A allele also associates with increased likelihood of death when present in the donor genotype (AA vs Aa or aa, hazard ratio 2.03, P = 0.0232). In patients who received increased prophylaxis with multi-agent therapy, patients whose graft was from a donor with an AA genotype had a substantially worse survival than patients whose graft was from a donor with a non-AA genotype (hazard ratio 12.93, P < 0.0001). Analysis of VDR genotype in prospective BMT recipients could indicate patients at risk of severe aGVHD. Analysis of VDR genotype in prospective BMT donors may identify individuals who have greater transplant-related mortality, and also allow appropriately restricted use of increased immunosuppressive prophylaxis."
2017,27719895,Simultaneous determination of atropine and scopolamine in buckwheat and related products using modified QuEChERS and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,"A method was developed for the determination of atropine and scopolamine in buckwheat and related products. A modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) extraction procedure was evaluated. Dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) was studied as clean-up step, using graphitized black carbon (GBC) and primary secondary amine (PSA). The extract was diluted with water (50:50, v/v) prior to chromatographic analysis. The method was validated and recoveries (except chia samples spiked at 10μg/kg) ranged from 75% to 92%. Intra and inter-day precision was lower than or equal to 17%. The limit of quantification of atropine and scopolamine was 0.4 and 2μg/kg, respectively. Eight types of samples (buckwheat, wheat, soy, buckwheat flour, buckwheat noodle, amaranth grain, chia seeds and peeled millet) were analyzed. Target compounds were not found above the detection limits of the method, but three transformation products of scopolamine (norscopine, hydroscopolamine and dihydroxyscopolamine) were putative identified in the tested samples using high resolution mass spectrometry (Exactive-Orbitrap)."
2016,27572154,Synergic effect of combination of glycyrol and fluconazole against experimental cutaneous candidiasis due to Candida albicans.,"In this study, we investigated the anti-fungal activity of glycyrol, a coumarine isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhizae Radix), in a murine model of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida albicans. Compared to the infected sites, located on the mice's back, of the untreated control mice, the infected sites treated with glycyrol had reduced CFU (colony forming unit) values up to 60 and 85.5 % at 20 and 40 μg/mouse of glycyrol, respectively (P < 0.01). The antifungal activity of glycyrol was synergistically increased when glycyrol (10 μg/mouse) was combined with fluconazole (10 μg/mouse), demonstrating that the combination therapy is approximately 4 times more effective than fluconazole alone at 20 μg/mouse (P < 0.01). Additionally, the combination activity was 1.65 times greater than the antifungal activity of fluconazole alone at 40 μg/mouse (P < 0.05). In seeking glycyrol's antifungal mechanism, we determined that glycyrol inhibited hyphal induction and cell wall adherence of C. albicans. Thus, it is very likely that, by damaging the cell wall, glycyrol helps fluconazole invade C. albicans more readily and attack fluconazole's target in the fungus membrane. In summary, our data indicate that glycyrol may contribute to the development of a novel agent that possesses antifungal activity against cutaneous candidiasis."
2018,29287379,"A micro-plate colorimetric assay for rapid determination of trace zinc in animal feed, pet food and drinking water by ion masking and statistical partitioning correction.","A new micro-plate colorimetric assay was developed for rapid determination of zinc in animal feed, pet food and drinking water. Zinc ion was extracted from sample by trichloroacetic acid and then reacted with 2-(5-Bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-[N-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino]phenol (5-Br-PAPS) to form a Zn-PAPS complex to be detected by a micro-plate reader at 552 nm. An ion masking formula including salicylaldoxime, deferoxamine and sodium citrate were screened and applied to exclude the interference from other heavy metals and a partitioning correction approach was proposed to eliminate the matrix effect derived from feed sample. The entire procedure can be completed within 40 min and the detection range was 0.038-8.0 μg mL-1 zinc in buffer solution. Moreover, the analysis in real samples revealed the consistency of results by this assay and those by atomic absorption spectrometry analysis. These features highlighted the possibility for this proposed assay to be used for rapid determination of zinc in complex samples."
2009,19471891,Inhibition of NF-kappaB by ginsenoside Rg3 enhances the susceptibility of colon cancer cells to docetaxel.,"Ginsenoside Rg3, the main constituent isolated from Panax ginseng, has been of interest for use as a cancer preventive or therapeutic agent. We investigated here whether Rg3 can inhibit the activity of NF-kappaB, a key transcriptional factor constitutively activated in colon cancer that confers cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. To investigate whether RG3 can suppress activation of NF-kappaB, and thus inhibit cancer cell growth, we examined the susceptibility of colon cancer cells (SW620 and HCT116) to treatment with Rg3 (25, 50, 75, 100 microM) and RG3-induced activation of NF-kappaB. RG3 dose-dependently inhibited cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis and decreased NF-kappaB activity. In a further study of compounds in colon cancer, we used half of the IC(50) dose, values in combined treatments of Rg3 (50 microM) with conventional agents - docetaxel (5 nM), paclitaxel (10 nM) cisplatin (10 microM) and doxorubicin (2 microM). Compared to treatment with Rg3 or chemotherapy alone, combined treatment was more effective (i.e., there were synergistic effects) in the inhibition of cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis and these effects were accompanied by significant inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. NF-kappaB target gene expression of apoptotic cell death proteins (Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9) was significantly enhanced, but the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and cell proliferation marker genes (Bcl-2, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP-1) and X chromosome IAP (XIAP), Cox-2, c-Fos, c-Jun and cyclin D1) was significantly inhibited by the combined treatment compared to Rg3 or docetaxel alone. These results indicate that ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits NF-kappaB, and enhances the susceptibility of colon cancer cells to docetaxel and other chemotherapeutics. Thus, ginsenoside Rg3 could be useful as an anti-cancer or adjuvant anti-cancer agent."
2011,21763290,"Protective effect of ellagic acid, a natural polyphenolic compound, in a murine model of Crohn's disease.","Current epidemiological and experimental studies support a beneficial role of dietary polyphenols in several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, ellagic acid, present in some fruits such as pomegranate, raspberries and nuts among others, in an experimental murine model of Crohn's disease by intra-colonic administration of TNBS in rats. Analysis of the lesions were carried out by macroscopic and histological technics. Inflammation response was assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase activity. iNOS and COX-2 are upregulated by MAPKs and NF-κB nuclear transcription factor in intestinal epithelial cells thus, we determined the expression of iNOS, COX-2 and the involvement of the p38, JNK, ERK1/2 MAPKs and NF-κB signalling in the protective effect of EA by western blotting. Oral administration of EA (10-20 mg/kg) diminished the severity and extension of the intestinal injuries induced by TNBS although there was no observed a significant dose-response. In addition, EA increased mucus production in goblet cells in colon mucosa, decreased neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory proteins COX-2 and iNOS overexpression. Also EA was capable of reducing the activation of p38, JNK and ERK1/2 MAPKs, preventing the inhibitory protein IκB-degradation and inducing an inhibition of the nuclear translocation level of p65 in colonic mucosa. In conclusion, EA reduces the damage in a rat model of Crohn's disease, alleviates the oxidative events and returns pro-inflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through MAPKs and NF-κB signalling pathways."
2018,29402262,Effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on severe acute pancreatitis through the regulation of mTOR/Akt and caspase-3 signaling pathway by upregulating miR-181b expression in rats.,"In China, Panax notoginseng has been used to treat oxidative stress-related diseases for a long time. Panax notoginseng saponins is an extract from Panax notoginseng Ledeb. Its therapeutic potential is related to antioxidant activity, but related mechanisms are still unclear. The study aims to assess the protection effects of Panax notoginseng saponins in the taurocholate-induced rat model of acute pancreatitis (AP) and explore underlying mechanisms.A rat model of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) was established in rats induced with taurocholate. Panax notoginseng saponins was firstly administered in the treatment group via intravenous injection. After 2 h, taurocholate administration was performed. After 24 h, the expression levels of miR-181b, Beclin1, LC3-II, Akt and mTOR from pancreas tissues were measured by Western Blotting and RT-PCR. Then the expression levels of Caspase-3 and Blc-2 were determined by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was assessed by the TUNEL assay. Amylase and lipase in serum were determined by ELISA and pancreatic water contents in pancreatic tissue were measured. After eosin and hematoxylin staining, the histologic analysis was performed.After SAP induction by taurocholate and the treatment with Panax notoginseng saponins for 24 h, we detected the up-regulated miR-181b, the reduced Bcl-2 expression, the increased activity of mTOR/Akt, the blocked Beclin1 and LC3-II expressions, and the enhanced Caspase-3 expression. Serum lipase and amylase levels were significantly decreased in the treatment group of Panax notoginseng saponins compared to the control group. Histological analysis results verified the attenuation effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on taurocholate-induced pancreas injury, apoptosis, and autophagy.By up-regulating the miR-181b expression level, Panax notoginseng saponins significantly reduced taurocholate-induced pancreas injury and autophagy and increased apoptosis. The significant protection effects of Panax notoginseng saponins suggested its potential in treating taurocholate induced-acute pancreatitis."
2000,11015300,Differences in the pharmacological properties of rat and chicken brain fatty acid amidohydrolase.,"The pharmacological properties of fatty acid amidohydrolase (FAAH) were investigated in brains of 35-day-old chickens, since nothing is known about the enzyme in avian species. FAAH activity towards both [(3)H]-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) [K(M)=1.5 microM] and [(3)H]-anandamide (AEA) [K(M)=5.4 microM] was demonstrated in the chicken brains. The chicken FAAH was inhibited by the substrate analogues oleyl trifluoromethylketone (OTMK) and diazomethylarachidonyl ketone (DAK) with similar potencies to the rat FAAH. However, in contrast to the rat brain, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the enantiomers of ibuprofen had very weak effects on chicken brain FAAH. Indomethacin and niflumic acid were found to inhibit rat brain AEA hydrolysis. The inhibition by indomethacin was reversible and competitive, with a K(i) value of 120 microM. Chicken FAAH was less sensitive to indomethacin than its rodent counterpart, but the inhibition was also competitive (K(i)). It is concluded that chicken FAAH activity has different pharmacological properties to its rodent counterpart."
1993,8363381,"Activity of bilobalide, a sesquiterpene from Ginkgo biloba, on Pneumocystis carinii.","The sesquiterpene bilobalide, extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was tested in vitro and in vivo for the ability to inhibit Pneumocystis carinii growth. Bilobalide was inhibitory to trophozoites cultured on human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEL 299) at approximately the same concentration as trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (lowest effective concentration, 50 micrograms of bilobalide per ml versus 9/45 microgram of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole per ml), inducing microscopically detectable morphological changes in the cytoplasm of the parasite. In pharmacologically immunosuppressed Sprague-Dawley rats transtracheally infected with a suspension of about 5 x 10(6) P. carinii trophozoites per ml, the daily intraperitoneal administration of bilobalide (10 mg/kg of body weight for 8 days) lowered the number of organisms by approximately 2 logs (that is, about 99%). There was no apparent toxicity either in uninfected HEL 299 feeder cells or in infected and uninfected animals. These studies suggest that the sesquiterpene bilobalide might be useful for therapy of and prophylaxis against P. carinii infections in humans."
2015,25943166,Cannabidiol effects in the prepulse inhibition disruption induced by amphetamine.,"The information processing appears to be deficient in schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), which measures the inhibition of a motor response by a weak sensory event, is considered particularly useful to understand the biology of information processing in schizophrenia patients. Drugs that facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission such as amphetamine induce PPI disruption in human and rodents. Clinical and neurobiological findings suggest that the endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids may be implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant, has also been reported to have potential as an antipsychotic.Our aim was to investigate if CBD pretreatment was able to prevent PPI disruption induced by amphetamine. Since one possible mechanism of CBD action is the facilitation of endocannabinoid-mediated neurotransmission through anandamide, we tested the effects of an anandamide hydrolysis inhibitor (URB597) in the amphetamine-induced PPI disruption.Male Swiss mice were treated with CBD systemic or intra-accumbens, or URB597 (systemic) prior to amphetamine and were exposed to PPI test.Amphetamine (10 mg/kg) disrupted PPI while CBD (15-60 mg/kg) or URB597 (0.1-1 mg/kg) administered alone had no effect. Pretreatment with CBD attenuated the amphetamine-disruptive effects on PPI test after systemic or intra-accumbens administration. Similar effects were also found with the inhibitor of anandamide hydrolysis.These results corroborate findings indicating that CBD induces antipsychotic-like effects. In addition, they pointed to the nucleus accumbens as a possible site of these effects. The increase of anandamide availability may be enrolled in the CBD effects."
1995,7718459,The effect of aspirin on haemostatic activity in the treatment of chronic venous leg ulceration.,"An increased rate of venous ulcer healing with the use of oral enteric-coated aspirin (300 mg) daily has been reported. Whether the effect of aspirin in this condition is related to its action on the haemostatic mechanism is unclear, and therefore this study aimed to assess the effect of aspirin on some haemostatic parameters in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of haemostatic activity and the effect of aspirin was implemented over a 4-month period. Twenty patients with venous leg ulcers, and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Patients received enteric-coated aspirin (300 mg) or placebo (one tablet) daily for 4 months, in addition to standardized local compressive bandaging (Setopress). Assessments made at recruitment, and at 2 and 4 months, included measurement of total ulcer surface area, haematological and biochemical screening, measurement of coagulation times, coagulation factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) and von Willebrand factor (vWF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. Procoagulant activity was assessed by a computer-assisted technique, to determine the rate of thrombin production in vitro. Patients with venous ulcers had increased levels of fibrinogen (P < 0.01), FVIII:C (P < 0.05), vWF (P < 0.05) and PAI-1 antigen (P < 0.01) compared with controls. Shortening of the coagulation rate, shown by a reduction of the time to generate 50% maximal thrombin activity in seconds (T50), was seen in patients, in comparison with control subjects (P < 0.05). T50 was longer in patients receiving aspirin than those receiving placebo, reflecting prolongation of coagulation rate in the aspirin-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2011,20180043,Antioxidant enzyme and element status in heroin addiction or heroin withdrawal in rats: effect of melatonin and vitamin E plus Se.,"Heroin use, withdrawal syndrome, and heroin-related deaths are still the most serious public health problems. Antioxidants and bio-elements are essential for metabolism in living organisms. To our knowledge, there are no data about the effect of antioxidant therapy on the levels of bio-elements and antioxidant enzymes in the naloxone (NX)-induced heroin withdrawal syndrome. Therefore, in the present study for the first time, we have investigated the role of antioxidant therapy, melatonin, and vitamin E plus Se, on the trace and major elements and antioxidant enzymes in the heroin addiction or heroin withdrawal in rats. Glutathione peroxidase levels were increased and catalase levels were decreased in the all study groups when compared to the sham group. The level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the fixed dose of heroin (FDH) given group was lower; however, in the variable doses of heroin (VDH) given group SOD level was higher. Furthermore, in withdrawal syndrome, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ti levels were diminished and Al, Ca, and Cu levels were increased in the FDH+NX group. Moreover, Mg, Mn, and Se levels were also diminished and Al level was increased in the VDH+NX group. In conclusion, our results obviously indicated that heroin effected both bio-element status and antioxidant enzyme activities and, exogenous melatonin or vE+Se therapy might relieve on the element and antioxidant enzyme the destructive activity caused by heroin."
2015,26077233,Vaginal innate immune mediators are modulated by a water extract of Houttuynia cordata Thunb.,"Vaginal epithelial cells (VECs) produce antimicrobial peptides including human β-defensin 2 (hBD2) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), as well as cytokines and chemokines that play vital roles in mucosal innate immunity of the female reproductive tract. Houttuynia cordata Thunb (H. cordata), a herbal plant found in Asia, possesses various activities including antimicrobial activity and anti-inflammation. As inflammation and infection are commonly found in female reproductive tract, we aimed to investigate the effects of H. cordata water extract in modulating innate immune factors produced by VECs.Primary human VECs were cultured and treated with H. cordata at a concentration ranging from 25-200 μg/ml for 6 or 18 h. After treatment, the cells and culture supernatants were harvested. The expression of hBD2 and SLPI mRNA was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Levels of secreted hBD2 and SLPI as well as cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants were measured by ELISA and Luminex assay, respectively. Cytotoxicity of the extract on VECs was assessed by CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay.H. cordata did not cause measurable toxicity on VECs after exposure for 18 h. The expression of hBD2 and SLPI mRNA as well as the secreted hBD2 protein were increased in response to H. cordata exposure for 18 h when compared to the untreated controls. However, treatment with the extract for 6 h had only slight effects on the mRNA expression of hBD2 and SLPI. The secretion of IL-2 and IL-6 proteins by VECs was also increased, while the secretion of CCL5 was decreased after treatment with the extract for 18 h. Treatment with H. cordata extract had some effects on the secretion of IL-4, IL-8, CCL2, and TNF-α, but not statistically significant.H. cordata water extract modulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines produced by VECs, which play an important role in the mucosal innate immunity in the female reproductive tract. Our findings suggest that H. cordata may have immunomodulatory effects on the vaginal mucosa. Further studies should be performed in vivo to determine if it can enhance mucosal immune defenses against microbial pathogens."
2018,29452588,Correction to: The antiangiogenic activities of ethanolic crude extracts of four Salvia species.,After the publication [1] it came to the attention of the authors that one of the co-authors was incorrectly included as Hamza Somrain. The correct spelling is as follows: Hamzeh Sumrein.
2016,27570173,Zerumbone alleviates chronic constriction injury-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia through serotonin 5-HT receptors.,"Zerumbone, a bioactive sesquiterpene isolated from Zingiber zerumbet (Smith), has shown to exert antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects in neuropathic pain mice model in our recent study. The mechanism through which zerumbone alleviates neuropathic pain has yet to be elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether the serotonergic system, part of the descending pain modulation pathway, contributes to the antineuropathic effect of zerumbone. Participation of the serotonergic system in zerumbone-induced antiallodynia and antihyperalgesia was assessed using Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer von Frey test and Hargreaves plantar test respectively in chronic-constriction injury mice model. Administration of ρ-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 100mg/kg, i.p.) for four consecutive days to deplete serotonin (5-HT) prior to zerumbone administration blocked the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. Further investigation with 5-HT receptor antagonists methiothepin (5-HT1/6/7 receptor antagonist, 0.1mg/kg), WAY-100635 (5-HT1A receptor antagonist, 1mg/kg), isamoltane (5-HT1B receptor antagonist, 2.5mg/kg), ketanserin (5-HT2A receptor antagonist, 0.3mg/kg) and ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist, 0.5mg/kg) managed to significantly attenuate antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of zerumbone (10mg/kg). These findings demonstrate that zerumbone alleviates mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia through the descending serotonergic system via 5-HT receptors 1A, 1B, 2A, 3, 6 and 7 in chronic constriction injury neuropathic pain mice."
2020,31534191,High dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for Wilms tumor: a study of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,"Survival for subgroups of patients with Wilms tumor (WT), such as those who suffer from relapse, is disappointing. Some patients' treatment plans include high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (aHCT), although proof for its benefit is lacking. To increase the level of evidence regarding children with WT receiving aHCT as consolidation of first or second remission (after first relapse), we extracted relevant data from the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry concerning 69 patients. Different HDT regimens were administered, mostly either melphalan-containing (n = 34) or thiotepa-containing (n = 14). For the whole population, 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) probabilities were 0.67 (±0.06) and 0.63 (±0.06), respectively (median observation time 7.8 years); for children transplanted in first remission, OS and EFS were 0.69 (±0.09) and 0.72 (±0.08). In univariate analysis, male gender and relapse in multiple sites were associated with lower OS probabilities. The use of a given pretransplant regimen (i.e. melphalan alone versus regimens with multiple drugs) did not seem to influence EFS/OS probability after aHCT, but significantly influenced platelet engraftment (more delayed with thiotepa). We here provide further data to improve the basis for future evidence-based clinical decision-making when using HDT and aHCT in relapsed/refractory WT."
2017,28782499,Antitumor activity of β-2-himachalen-6-ol in colon cancer is mediated through its inhibition of the PI3K and MAPK pathways.,"Previous studies in our laboratory showed that Daucus carota oil extract (DCOE) possesses in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities. Chemical analysis of DCOE led to the isolation of β-2-himachalen-6-ol (HC) which exhibited potent anticancer activity against colon, breast, brain and skin cancer cells. The present study investigates the anticancer activity of HC against SW1116 colon cancer cell lines, and evaluates its effect in a 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) colon carcinogenesis black6 mice model. The SW1116 colon cancer cell line was treated with HC (1, 5, 10 and 25 μg/ml) and cell viability was evaluated with WST 1 assay kit. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry, and pro/anti-apoptotic proteins were measured using western blot. The effect of intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with HC (10, 25 and 50 μg/ml) in mice was assessed using the DMH colon carcinogenesis model with Cisplatin (2.5 μg/kg; IP) as a positive control. Blood samples were collected for assessment of liver toxicity and colon tumor incidence and size were studied histologically. HC showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival with an IC50 of 18 and 14.5 μg/ml after 24 and 48 h respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 10 μg/ml HC increased the number of cells undergoing necrosis (18.05%) and late apoptosis (15.66%). At HC 25 μg/ml more cells shifted toward necrosis (58.01%) and late apoptosis (30.47%). Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in p-Erk, p-Akt, pro-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 and an increase in p53, p21, Bax and PARP proteins. Mice treatment (IP) with HC caused a significant decrease in tumor incidence and size. Similar effects were observed with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, HC treatment (low dose) induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis via inhibition of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. HC treatment also had antitumor effect in vivo with no significant toxicity to laboratory mice."
1995,7766185,Isolation and amino acid sequences of two trypsin inhibitors from the seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia).,"Two novel trypsin inhibitors, MCTI-II' and BGIT, were isolated from the seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) and their amino acids sequenced. MCTI-II' was a squash type trypsin inhibitor and lacked the N-terminal arginine residue of Momordica charantia trypsin inhibitor (MCTI)-II. It consists of 27 amino acid residues and forms a dimeric structure. BGIT had 88% homology with bitter gourd inhibitor against an acidic amino acid-specific endopeptidase (BGIA) consisting of 68 amino acid residues and inhibited not only trypsin but also subtilisin Carlsberg. The amino acid replacements occurred in 8 positions of which that of Gln2 by Arg or of Ala44 by Lys is suggested to be responsible for the trypsin-inhibitory action of BGIT. Inhibitory activity of BGIT for trypsin was greatly decreased by acetylation, while that for subtilisin was slightly increased. From these results and the sequence comparison with eglin-c superfamily inhibitors, the reactive site of BGIT is assumed to be Lys44."
2019,30309559,"Taste-guided isolation of sweet-tasting compounds from grape seeds, structural elucidation and identification in wines.","This work aimed at improving knowledge about sweetness in dry wines. Following on from the empirical observations of winegrowers, we assessed the contribution of grape seeds to wine sensory properties. An inductive fractionation method guided by gustatometry was used to isolate and characterize sweet-tasting compounds from grapes. Fractionation of grape seed macerates was achieved by liquid-liquid extraction, centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and preparative HPLC. Then, the structures of the purified compounds were elucidated by use of FTMS and NMR. Five compounds were identified: two new compounds, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic-2-O-β-glucopyranoside (H3MP-G) and 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic-2-O-β-glucopyranoside acids (H4MP-G), along with gallic-4-O-β-glucopyranoside acid (AG-G), 3-indolyl-(2R)-O-β-d-glycoside lactic acid (ILA-G) and epi-DPA-3'-O-β-glucopyranoside acid (epi-DPA-G). These compounds exhibited various levels of sweetness in a hydro-ethanolic solution and in white and red wines. Additionally, H3MP-G, H4MP-G and epi-DPA-G were identified for the first time in grapes and wines, whereas AG-G has already been reported in white grapes but never in wine."
2011,21172346,"Effect of kaempferol on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced colorectal carcinoma in rats.","Colorectal cancer, a common cause of cancer related deaths in both sexes in western population is often due to persistent oxidative stress leading to DNA damage. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and inhibit neoplastic process. Kaempferol, a flavonol widely distributed in tea, broccoli, grape fruit, brussels sprouts and apple, is claimed to have chemopreventive action in colon cancer. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of kaempferol on tissue lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced colorectal cancer in male Wistar rats and to compare its efficacy with irinotecan. Experimental colon cancer induced by 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine in rats mimic human colon cancer and therefore is an ideal model for chemoprevention studies. The rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 served as control. Group 2 received 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (20 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously once a week for four weeks. Group 3 received irinotecan (100 mg/kg body weight) intravenously once a week for four weeks with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine. Groups 4 to 6 were given a daily oral dose of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight of kaempferol with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine. The total study period was 16 weeks. Kaempferol supplementation lowered 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced erythrocyte lysate and liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level and rejuvenated anti oxidant enzymes catalase, super oxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The recovery of enzyme status was maximum at the dose of 200 mg/kg body weight and was comparable to irinotecan. Our study reveals that kaempferol could be safely used as a chemopreventive agent in colorectal cancer."
2019,31047898,Silymarin protects against radiocontrast-induced nephropathy in mice.,"Silymarin, an extract from Silybum marianum (milk thistle) containing a standardized mixture of flavonolignans that ameliorates some types of liver disease and, more recently, kidney damage, could be used for the ROS-scavenging effect of these antioxidants. Furthermore, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic impairment of renal function in patients subjected to angiographic procedures for which there is not yet a successful preventative treatment. Recent evidence has shown that this event is related to tubular/vascular injury activated mainly by oxidative stress. However, whether this bioavailable and pharmacologically safe extract protects against CIN is not clear. We proposed to evaluate the possible protective role of the antioxidant silymarin in an experimental model of CIN. Adult male Swiss mice were separated into 6 groups and pretreated orally with silymarin (50, 200 and 300 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days before the CIN and control groups. Renal function was analyzed by plasma creatinine, urea and cystatin C levels. Additionally, blood reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated using ROS bioavailability, protein oxidation and DNA damage. Renal oxidative damage was evaluated using apoptosis/cell viability assays and histological analysis. We showed that silymarin preserved renal function and decreased systemic and renal oxidative damage (antigenotoxic and antiapoptotic properties, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner and was superior to conventional treatment with N-acetylcysteine. Histologically, silymarin treatment also had beneficial effects on renal glomerular and tubular injuries. Therefore, silymarin prophylaxis may be an interesting strategy for the prevention of CIN."
2017,28095354,Heliangin inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation through signaling NF-κB pathway on LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells.,"The heliangin is a natural agent mainly isolated from Helianthus tuberosus L. (Asteraceae). In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of heliangin, several typical models in vivo and in vitro were performed. The RAW264.7 mouse macrophages cells were employed in vitro and dexamethasone were conducted as positive. The cytotoxicity results of heliangin on RAW 264.7 cells provided the safety in vitro for further study. The mRNA of TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 were degraded under heliangin exposure in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The protein expression of iNOS, COX-2 were decreased via heliangin exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Heliangin inhibited TNF-α, NO, IL-6 and PGE2 expression levels in macrophage cells lysate. The immunocytochemistry assay showed the fluorescence image of heliangin treatment intercepted the p65 translocation process from outside to inside of nuclei triggered by LPS. Moreover, we founded that MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway play important roles in heliangin's activity on RAW264.7 cells. Secondly, the acute toxic study results of heliangin manifested the safety in vivo. Heliangin exerted anti-inflammation effect in a xylene-induced ear swelling in BALB/C mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema model in SD rats. The cytokines levels (TNF-α, IL-6 and PGE2) were decreased.

Hence, this study seeks to determine the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities of acetone leaf extracts of nine South African medicinal plants that have been used traditionally to treat arthritis and inflammation.The anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts was determined by investigating inhibition of nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 macrophages as well as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition. An anti-protein denaturation assay was used to determine the anti-arthritic properties of the extracts. The antioxidant activity was determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The total phenolic and total flavonoid concentration of extracts were determined by using standard methods.All extracts inhibited nitric oxide production in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Extracts of Maesa lanceolata and Heteromorpha arborescens inhibited NO production by 99.16 % and 89.48 % at a concentration of 30 μg/ml respectively. Elaeodendron croceum and Calpurnia aurea extracts had strong activity against 15-lipoxygenase activity with IC50 values of 26.23 and 34.70 μg/ml respectively. Morus mesozygia and Heteromorpha arborescens extracts had good in vitro anti-arthritic activity with IC50 values of 11.89 and 53.78 μg/ml, the positive control diclofenac sodium had IC50 value of 32.37 μg/ml. The free radical scavenging activity of the extracts in DPPH assays ranged between 7.72 and 154.77 μg/ml. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and FRAP values ranged from 0.06 to 1.32 and 0.06 to 0.99 respectively.Results from this study support the traditional use of the selected medicinal plants in the management of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. The free radical scavenging capacity of the extracts may be related to an immune boosting potential."
2016,26266964,New trimethyl chitosan-based composite nanoparticles as promising antibacterial agents.,"In the present study, densely dispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were rapidly green synthesized in the presence of Rumex dentatus aqueous extract, followed by UV-irradiation reduction. The Ag NPs were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, and TEM. Then, the Ag NPs were incorporated into interpenetrating polymeric networks based on cationic trimethyl chitosan (TMCS) and anionic poly(acrylamide-co-sodium acrylate) copolymer to develop a new series of composite nanoparticles as potential antibacterial agents. Both TMCS and poly(acrylamide-co-sodium acrylate) were prepared in the study, and characterized using FTIR, DSC, and SEM. The synthesized Ag NPs showed high purity and uniform particle size distribution with particle size ranged between 5 and 30 nm. The composite nanoparticles demonstrated homogeneous spherical shape with size in the range of 378-402 nm. Both Ag NPs and the composite nanoparticles showed promising bactericidal activity as compared with the control. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the composite nanoparticles increased along with increasing the concentrations of Ag NPs and the TMCS."
2008,18331390,In vitro inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and P-glycoprotein-mediated transport by trade herbal products.,"Extracts of six commonly used commercially available herbal products, St. John's wort, common valerian, common sage, Ginkgo biloba, Echinacea purpurea and horse chestnut were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potential of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and P-glycoprotein efflux transport activity. C-DNA baculovirus expressed CYP3A4 and Caco-2 cells were used. Ketoconazole and verapamil were applied as positive control inhibitors, respectively. A validated high-performance liquid chromatography methodology was used to quantify the formation of 6-OH-testosterone and scintillation counting was used to quantify the transport of (3)H-digoxin. All the investigated herbs inhibited CYP3A4 activity. St. John's wort was the strongest inhibiting herb with an IC(50) value of 15.4 microg/ml, followed by common sage, Ginkgo biloba, common valerian, horse chestnut and Echinacea purpurea. All herbs also inhibited P-glycoprotein activity. Ginkgo biloba was the strongest inhibiting herb, inhibiting the net digoxin flux with an IC(50) value of 23.6 microg/ml, followed by St. John's wort, horse chestnut, common sage, common valerian and Echinacea purpurea. No correlation was found between the herbs inhibitory potentials towards CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein activities. Ginkgo biloba, horse chestnut and common sage, besides St. John's wort, are suggested candidates for in vivo intestinal herb-drug pharmacokinetic interactions."
2012,23051678,Thymoquinone: Novel gastroprotective mechanisms.,"Ample of evidence proved the gastroprotective effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of Nigella sativa oil; however, the full mechanistic cassette on the gastric ulcer etiopathogenesis is not fully elucidated. The aim of the present work is to unveil some of the possible mechanisms. Animals were injected with vehicle, TQ (10 & 20mg/kg), omeprazole (10 & 20mg/kg) or their combination (10mg/kg). Thirty minutes later, pyloric ligation was carried out and followed consequently with ischemia for another 30min, abided by reperfusion for 120min. The ischemia/reperfusion insult increased the gastric acid secretion, acid output, and pepsin, as well as the gastric mucosal content/activity of lipid peroxide, proton pump and myeloperoxidase, along with ulcer index. However, content/activity of gastric mucin, reduced glutathione, total nitric oxide, and superoxide dismutase were decreased. TQ, especially the high dose level, corrected the altered parameters in a comparable manner to that of the reference drug used, omeprazole. In addition, when the low doses were combined they add to each other to reach the effect of the high dose of either drug. These results showed that apart from its known antioxidant properties, TQ has novel gastroprotective mechanisms via inhibiting proton pump, acid secretion and neutrophil infiltration, while enhancing mucin secretion, and nitric oxide production."
2009,19174152,Fyn kinase is a direct molecular target of delphinidin for the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-mediated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression plays key roles in inflammation and tumorigenesis, particularly skin carcinogenesis, and hence targeting the TNF-alpha-mediated signaling pathway might be a promising strategy for developing chemopreventive agents against skin cancer and other skin disorders. Here we report that Fyn kinase - one of the members of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase family - is involved in TNF-alpha-induced COX-2 expression, and that delphinidin - a major anthocyanidin present in red wine and berries - inhibits these effects by directly inhibiting Fyn kinase activity. Delphinidin strongly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced COX-2 expression in JB6 P+ mouse epidermal (JB6 P+) cells, whereas two other major phenolic compounds (resveratrol and gallic acid) did not exert significant inhibitory effects. Delphinidin inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylations of JNK, p38 MAP kinase, Akt, p90RSK, MSK1, and ERK, and subsequently blocked the activation of the eukaryotic transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Kinase and pull-down assay data revealed that delphinidin inhibited Fyn kinase activity and directly bound with Fyn kinase noncompetitively with ATP. By using PP2 (a commercial inhibitor of Fyn kinase) and siRNA-Fyn, we confirmed that Fyn kinase is involved in TNF-alpha-induced COX-2 expression mainly by down-regulating JNK in JB6 P+ cells. Together these findings suggest that the targeted inhibition of Fyn kinase activity and COX-2 expression by delphinidin contributes to the chemopreventive potential of red wine and berries."
1988,3222539,Effect of selenium on sheep lymphocyte responses to mitogens.,"The effect of selenium (Se) on sheep lymphocyte response to mitogens was studied. In an indoor experiment lambs were fed a basal diet containing 0.13 mg Se kg-1, and supplemented with, respectively, 0.1 or 0.5 mg Se kg-1, either as sodium selenite or as selenomethionine. Enhancement of the proliferative response of lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and concanavalin A was found in lambs following selenium supplementation at the lower levels. The highest dietary selenium content, however, induced decreased mitogen response. Transient increases in lymphocyte response to PHA and PWM by ewes supplemented with selenium was demonstrated in one field study and a combined effect of selenium and vitamin E was seen in another. There was no stimulatory effect on the mitogen response of lymphocytes from sheep supplemented with dietary vitamin E alone."
2012,22281117,New developments on the galactopoietic role of prolactin in dairy ruminants.,"In most mammals, prolactin (PRL) is essential for maintaining lactation and its suppression strongly inhibits lactation. However, the involvement of PRL in the control of ruminant lactation is less clear because inconsistent effects on milk yield have been observed with short-term suppression of PRL by bromocriptine. By contrast, in vitro studies have provided evidence that PRL helps to maintain the differentiation state and act as a survival factor for mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, a series of experiments were conducted to assess the galactopoietic role of PRL. In a first experiment, daily injections of the PRL inhibitor quinagolide reduced milking-induced PRL release and induced a faster decline in milk production. Milk production was correlated with PRL released at milking. Quinagolide reduced mammary cell activity, survival, and proliferation. During the last week of treatments, differential milking (1× vs 2×) was applied. The inhibition of milk production by quinagolide was maintained in the udder half that was milked 2× but not in the udder half milked 1×, suggesting that the response to PRL is modulated at the gland level. In a second experiment, cows were injected with quinagolide, quinagolide + injection of bovine PRL at milking time, or water. As in the first experiment, quinagolide reduced milk, protein, and lactose yields. Although PRL injections at milking time were not sufficient to restore milk yield, they tended to increase milk protein and lactose yields and increased the viability of milk-purified mammary epithelial cells. Recently, we investigated the use of quinagolide at drying off. Treating late-lactation cows with quinagolide decreased milk production within the first day of treatment and induced faster increases in somatic cells and bovine serum albumin content in mammary secretions after drying off, which indicates an acceleration of mammary gland involution. In conclusion, these data, combined with data from other studies, provide a good body of evidence indicating that PRL is galactopoietic in dairy cows. However, the response to PRL appears to be modulated at the mammary gland level."
2011,20466393,"Partial budgeting assessment of the treatment of pyometra, follicular cysts and ovarian inactivity causing postpartum anoestrus in dairy cattle.","A total of 412 multiparous German Holstein cows were screened for postpartum pyometra, follicular cysts and ovarian inactivity to assess economic and productivity losses in relation to pharmaceutical expenditures. Our results show that cows treated for pyometra with prostaglandin f2 alpha (PGF2α) and oxytetracycline had significantly (P<0.05) greater total and net returns than untreated cows or those treated with PGF2α+cephapirin or PGF2α alone. Milk yields from untreated cows affected by follicular cysts were significantly (P<0.05) lower than the yields from cows treated with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)- and GnRH+PGF2α. In addition, the use of GnRH to treat cows with ovarian inactivity resulted in significantly (P<0.05) lower costs and greater total and net return values compared to untreated controls."
2014,24882083,Pretreatment with turmeric modulates the inhibitory influence of cisplatin and paclitaxel on CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2 in isolated rat hepatic microsomes.,"Previous animal studies have shown that turmeric can significantly modulate the activity of several drug metabolizing enzymes, this may dramatically affect the bioavailability of several drugs resulting in over dose or less therapeutic effects. This study was directed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel on two CYP450 enzymes namely CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2 in hepatic microsomes isolated from normal and turmeric pretreated rats. Cisplatin and paclitaxel were added by different concentrations to hepatic microsomes isolated from untreated and turmeric (100 mg/kg/day) pretreated rats for 15 days after receiving pyrazole or dexamethasone for induction of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2 respectively. The kinetic potency of these drugs as CYP inhibitors was determined by analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plot. Addition of cisplatin or paclitaxel by (10, 50 and 100 μM) to hepatic microsomes from normal or turmeric pretreated rats caused a concentration dependent inhibition of CYP2E1, with an evidence of less inhibition in turmeric pretreated microsomes particularly at higher concentration. Both drugs at 100 μM displayed a mixed type of inhibition of CYP2E1 in normal or turmeric pretreated microsomes where paclitaxel was the most potent inhibitor. Cisplatin (10, 50 and 100 μM) caused a concentration dependant inhibition of CYP3A1/2 that was enhanced by turmeric pretreatment. The inhibition of CYP3A1/2 by cisplatin (100 μM) was in non-competitive manner with a smaller Ki value in turmeric pretreated microsomes. The inhibitory influence of paclitaxel (10, 50 and 100 μM) on CYP3A1/2 decreased with increasing the drug concentration and this inhibition was augmented by turmeric pretreatment. Interestingly, the inhibition of this enzyme by paclitaxel (10 μM) was switched from mixed type in normal microsomes to competitive manner in turmeric pretreated ones with a marked reduction of Ki values reflecting greater inhibitory influence of paclitaxel on CYP3A1/2 by turmeric pretreatment. In conclusion, turmeric pretreatment attenuated the inhibitory influence of cisplatin and paclitaxel on CYP2E1 activity and magnified their inhibition on CYP3A1/2, thus the use of turmeric with drugs or other medications should raise concern for drugs-herb interactions."
2012,22493161,Effect of microwave field on trypsin inhibitors activity and protein quality of broad bean seeds (Vicia faba var. major).,"In human nutrition legume seeds are usually subjected to soaking and thermal processes, mainly by using traditional cooking method. This method which has been used for decades, does not allow to control and adjust the parameters of this process. Therefore it does not seem to be the optimal method. Undoubtedly, microwave field is an alternative thermal process to conventional technique. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of microwave field on the activity of trypsin inhibitors and protein quality of three varieties of broad bean seeds.The study was performed on dry seeds of broad bean varieties Windsor White, Bachus and Basta. The seeds were soaked and heated in a microwave. The seeds absorbed different energy doses from 500 J/g, through 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750 to 2000 J/g. The study material prepared in this way was tested for trypsin inhibitor activity, protein solubility and in vitro protein digestibility. The results were analysed by the one-way analysis of variance.Microwave heating resulted in decreased activity of trypsin inhibitors and protein solubility and increased digestibility of protein in all tested varieties of broad bean seeds. With increasing doses of the microwave field energy a decrease in protein solubility was observed. Satisfactory reduction in trypsin inhibitors at the level of 70-75% and highest protein digestibility were obtained by using a microwave field with energy dose of 1000 J/g of seeds.It can be concluded that the optimal dose of microwave energy field which will produce a relatively low activity of trypsin inhibitors and the highest protein digestibility together with maintaining solubility of broad been seeds was 1000 J/g seed."
2003,14609137,Differential effect of bovine serum albumin on ginsenoside metabolite-induced inhibition of alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes.,"Ginsenosides, major active ingredients of Panax ginseng, that exhibit various pharmacological and physiological actions are transformed into compound K (CK) or M4 by intestinal microorganisms. CK is a metabolite derived from protopanaxadiol (PD) ginsenosides, whereas M4 is a metabolite derived from protopanaxatriol (PT) ginsenosides. Recent reports shows that ginsenosides might play a role as pro-drugs for these metabolites. In present study, we investigated the effect of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is one of major binding proteins on various neurotransmitters, hormones, and other pharmacological agents, on ginsenoside Rg2-, CK-, or M4-induced regulation of alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channel activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In the absence of BSA, treatment of ACh elicited inward peak current (I(ACh)) in oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptor. Co-treatment of ginsenoside Rg2, CK, or M4 with ACh inhibited I(ACh) in oocytes expressing (alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptor with reversible and dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 1% BSA, treatment of ACh still elicited I(ACh) in oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptor and co-treatment of ginsenoside Rg2 or M4 but not CK with ACh inhibited I(ACh) in oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptor with reversible and dose-dependent manner. These results show that BSA interferes the action of CK rather than M4 on the inhibitory effect of I(ACh) in oocytes expressing alpha3beta4 nicotinic ACh receptor and further suggest that BSA exhibits a differential interaction on ginsenoside metabolites."
2019,30728756,β-Fructofuranosidase and β -D-Fructosyltransferase from New Aspergillus carbonarius PC-4 Strain Isolated from Canned Peach Syrup: Effect of Carbon and Nitrogen Sources on Enzyme Production.,"β-fructofuranosidase (invertase) and β-D-fructosyltransferase (FTase) are enzymes used in industrial processes to hydrolyze sucrose aiming to produce inverted sugar syrup or fructooligosaccharides. In this work, a black Aspergillus sp. PC-4 was selected among six filamentous fungi isolated from canned peach syrup which were initially screened for invertase production. Cultivations with pure carbon sources showed that invertase and FTase were produced from glucose and sucrose, but high levels were also obtained from raffinose and inulin. Pineapple crown was the best complex carbon source for invertase (6.71 U/mL after 3 days of cultivation) and FTase production (14.60 U/mL after 5 days of cultivation). Yeast extract and ammonium chloride nitrogen sources provided higher production of invertase (6.80 U/mL and 6.30 U/mL, respectively), whereas ammonium nitrate and soybean protein were the best nitrogen sources for FTase production (24.00 U/mL and 24.90 U/mL, respectively). Fermentation parameters for invertase using yeast extract were Y P/S = 536.85 U/g and P P = 1.49 U/g/h. FTase production showed values of Y P/S = 2,627.93 U/g and P P = 4.4 U/h using soybean protein. The screening for best culture conditions showed an increase of invertase production values by 5.10-fold after 96 h cultivation compared to initial experiments (fungi bioprospection), while FTase production increased by 14.60-fold (44.40 U/mL) after 168 h cultivation. A. carbonarius PC-4 is a new promising strain for invertase and FTase production from low cost carbon sources, whose synthesized enzymes are suitable for the production of inverted sugar, fructose syrups, and fructooligosaccharides."
2018,29548461,Iodine content in bulk biomass of wild-harvested and cultivated edible seaweeds: Inherent variations determine species-specific daily allowable consumption.,"This study represents a large-scale investigation into iodine contents in three commercially important and edible seaweed species from the North Atlantic: the brown algae Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta, and the red alga Palmaria palmata. Variability among and within species were explored in terms of temporal and spatial variations in addition to biomass source. Mean iodine concentration in bulk seaweed biomass was species-specific: Saccharina > Alaria > Palmaria. Iodine contents of Saccharina biomass were similar between years and seasons, but varied significantly between sampling locations and biomass sources. In Alaria and Palmaria, none of the independent variables examined contributed significantly to the small variations observed. Our data suggest that all three species are rich sources of iodine, and only 32, 283, or 2149 mg dry weight of unprocessed dry biomass of Saccharina, Alaria, or Palmaria, respectively, meets the recommended daily intake levels for most healthy humans."
2009,19202268,Effects of zinc on intestinal injury and some serum parameters in ethanol-administered rats.,"This study was designed to determine the morphological and biochemical effects of zinc sulfate and the role of metallothionein in ethanol-induced intestinal injury. Rats received zinc sulfate (100 mg/kg/d) for 3 consecutive d, 2 h prior to the administration of ethanol by gavage. Ethanol administration caused intestinal injury as determined by increased serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, urea, creatinine, uric acid, and sialic acid levels, intestinal lipid peroxidation level, decreased serum catalase activity, intestinal glutathione level, and metallothionein expression. Zinc sulfate pretreatment of the ethanol group caused a decrease in histological damage, serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sialic acid levels, and intestinal lipid peroxidation level, but increases in serum catalase activity, intestinal glutathione level, and metallothionein expression. The present study indicates that zinc sulfate has a protective effect against ethanol-induced intestinal injury. In addition, the protective effect of zinc on ethanol-induced intestinal injury might be mediated by metallothionein, as well as having antioxidative potential."
2017,28282784,Carnosic acid cooperates with tamoxifen to induce apoptosis associated with Caspase-3 activation in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.,"Tamoxifen is known as a standard therapeutic treatment for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which down-regulates breast cancer mortality by 31% approximately. Carnosic acid is a phenolic diterpene, which has anti-cancer, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-bacterial properties, generated by various species coming from Lamiaceae family. The breast cancer is reported as one of the most common tumors among women worldwide. In our study, the possible benefits of carnosic acid cooperation with tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo were investigated. Carnosic acid and tamoxifen cooperation led to apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Caspase-3 signaling pathway was promoted for carnosic acid and tamoxifen co-treatment. Consistently, anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl were down-regulated, while pro-apoptotic signals Bax and Bad were up-regulated. The elevation of decoy receptor 1 and 2 (DcR1 and DcR2) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were enhanced for carnosic acid and tamoxifen cooperation. Furthermore, the mouse xenograft model in vivo suggested that carnosic acid and tamoxifen combined therapy inhibited breast cancer growth in comparison to the carnosic acid or tamoxifen monotherapy. Our study supplies a novel therapeutic strategy to induce apoptosis for suppressing breast cancer, which was relied on Caspase-3/TRAIL activation."
2005,15979257,"Vinclozolin, a widely used fungizide, enhanced BaP-induced micronucleus formation in human derived hepatoma cells by increasing CYP1A1 expression.","Vinclozolin, a widely used fungicide, can be identified as a residue in numerous vegetable and fruit samples. To get insight in its genetic toxicity, we investigated the genotoxic effect of vinclozolin in the human derived hepatoma cell line HepG2 using the micronucleus (MN) assay. Additionally, to evaluate the co- or anti-mutagenic potency of vinclozolin, we treated HepG2 cells with different concentrations of vinclozolin for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) for 1h. Exposure of HepG2 cells to 50-400 microM vinclozolin alone did not cause any induction of micronuclei. However, a pronounced co-mutagenic effect was observed. MN frequencies caused by BaP increased by 30.6%, 52.8% and 65.3% after pretreatment of the cell cultures with 50, 100 and 200 microM vinclozolin, respectively. The highest concentration (400 microM) of vinclozolin tested caused cytotoxicity. Therefore, micronuclei were not considered for that concentration. To clarify the mechanism of cogenotoxicity, we assayed cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which plays a pivotal role in activation of BaP. Cells exposed to vinclozolin led to significant increase of CYP1A1 expression in Western blot. The result suggested that induction of CYP1A1 by vinclozolin account for its enhancing effect on genotoxicity caused by BaP."
2016,27643558,Anticancer activity of silver nanoparticles from Panax ginseng fresh leaves in human cancer cells.,"The pharmaceutical role of silver nanoparticles has been increased over the last decades, especially those synthesized through herbal medicinal plants, due to their variety of pharmacological importance. Panax ginseng Meyer (P. ginseng) has been widely used as a therapeutic herbal medicine for a long time in cancer treatment. In this study, the cytotoxic and oxidative effect of a novel silver nanoparticles synthesized from P. ginseng fresh leaves (P.g AgNPs) were evaluated in different human cancer cell lines. In addition, the effect of P.g AgNPs on cell migration, apoptosis and the determination of the mechanism involve was determinate by the use of A549 lung cancer cell line. It was found that P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited cell viability and induced oxidative stress in A549, MCF7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Likewise, P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced migration, as well as decreased the mRNA levels and phosphorylation of EGF receptors in A549 cells. Moreover, P.g AgNPs modified the morphology of the cell nucleus and increase apoptosis percentage; this effect was linked to the stimulation of p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Taken together, our results showed that P.g AgNPs exhibited anti-cancer activity in A549 and the regulation of EGFR/p38 MAPK/p53 pathway might be the possible mechanism of its anti-activity. Further experiments are suggested to determinate the mechanism by which P.g AgNPs induce cytotoxicity and ROS generation in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells."
1992,1462922,"Flecainide acetate for treatment of tachyarrhythmias in children: review of world literature on efficacy, safety, and dosing.","A review of all published experience with flecainide in infants, children, and fetuses was performed to evaluate the appropriate place of the drug in pediatric practice and to determine dosing guidelines. A total of 704 case references was generated. Flecainide appeared to be safe (no deaths with usual oral dosing, < 1% serious proarrhythmia) and effective (73% to 100% control, depending on mechanism) in children with supraventricular tachycardia. The drug was very effective for treatment of fetal tachyarrhythmias. Flecainide may not be safe for children who have structurally abnormal hearts and atrial flutter or ventricular arrhythmias. The safety of flecainide for patients with ventricular arrhythmias and normal hearts requires further investigation. Pharmacokinetic data reveal an age-dependent change in elimination half-life. Patients younger than 1 year of age have a plasma elimination half-life that is similar to that in children older than 12 years (i.e., 11 to 12 hours). Children aged 1 to 12 years have a mean elimination half-life of 8 hours. The effective flecainide dose is 100 to 200 mg/m2/day or 1 to 8 mg/kg/day. Toxicity may occur with doses in excess of these ranges, especially when high doses are accompanied by low serum trough levels. Milk blocks flecainide absorption, and toxicity may become manifest when milk products are removed from the diet."
2017,28272690,Licorice and its active compound glycyrrhizic acid ameliorates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through inactivation of p53 by scavenging ROS and overexpression of p21 in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.,"Nephrotoxicity is one of the major side effects that limit the use of cisplatin in cancer therapy. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in renal cells is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated p53 activation. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer) is one of the most widely used medicinal herbs in Korea, China and Japan. The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effects of licorice extract (LE) and its active compound glycyrrhizic acid (GA) against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells.HK-2 cells were pretreated with LE or GA for 1 h and then treated with 40 μM of cisplatin for indicated times under the serum-free condition. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis and caspase-3 activity. The intracellular ROS levels were determined by DCFH-DA assay. The expression and phosphorylation levels of protein were evaluated by Western blot and densitometry analysis.When treating HK-2 cells with LE or GA, both of them alleviated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. LE and GA inhibited caspase-3 activity and polymerase (PARP) cleavage in cisplatin-treated cells. LE and GA also inhibited p53 expression and its phosphorylation as well as ROS production in cells exposed to cisplatin. Meanwhile, LE and GA enhanced cisplatin-induced p21 expression, which then led to S-phase arrest in cell cycle and limited cell growth. Presumably, increased p21 expression may contribute to cellular prevention from cisplatin-induced apoptosis, because p21 is the key molecule to cytoprotection during cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.These results suggest that LE and GA ameliorate cisplatin-induced apoptosis through reduction of ROS-mediating p53 activation and promotion of p21 expression in HK-2 cells."
2011,21217785,A single nucleotide polymorphism of IL-17 gene in the recipient is associated with acute GVHD after HLA-matched unrelated BMT.,"IL-17 has an important role in the host defense against extracellular pathogens and the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases. This study retrospectively examined the impact of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2275913, G197A) in the IL-17 gene of a total 510 recipients with hematologic malignancies and their unrelated donors on the clinical outcomes in HLA-matched myeloablative (discovery study) and nonmyeloablative (validation study) BMT through the Japan Marrow Donor Program (JMDP). In the discovery study, the presence of a 197A genotype in the recipient resulted in a higher incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio (HR), 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-2.85; P=0.004). The donor IL-17A genotype did not significantly influence the transplant outcomes. The validation study showed a trend toward an association of the recipient 197A genotype with an increased risk of grades III-IV acute GVHD (HR, 5.84; 95% CI, 0.75-45.72; P=0.09), as well as a significantly increased risk for chronic GVHD (HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.29-11.59; P=0.02). These results suggest an association of the 197A genotype in the recipient side with the development of acute GVHD."
2018,29548444,Effect of Cryptococcus laurentii on inducing disease resistance in cherry tomato fruit with focus on the expression of defense-related genes.,"The objective of this study was to prove and explain the disease resistance-inducing ability of Cryptococcus laurentii on cherry tomato, as well as assay its effect on fruit quality. Apart from disease incidence, activities of defense-related enzymes and expression of critical genes were studied. With pre-treatment of C. laurentii, disease incidences of Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternate infected fruits were both significantly reduced. Corresponding mechanism could be explained as C. laurentii can induce resistance in cherry tomato by activating the expression of important defense-related genes, such as genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways and genes encoding pathogenesis related proteins, thus activating comprehensive defense reaction against pathogen invasion. Coupled with the results that fruit color was improved and other physicochemical parameters remained uninfluenced, our study suggests that pre-treatment with C. laurentii can be a promising method to preserve cherry tomato fruits."
2016,26856623,Impact of protein-rich meals on glycaemic response of rice.,"Asians typically consume carbohydrate-rich and high-glycaemic-index diets that have been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Rice is rarely eaten alone such that it is of interest to investigate the effects of co-ingesting different protein-rich meals with rice on insulin and glycaemic response. This study had a randomised, controlled, non-blind, cross-over design in which fifteen healthy Chinese male participants were required to come on non-consecutive days. Five rice-based test meals were served: rice alone (control), rice with fish (RWF), rice with egg white (RWE), rice with soya beancurd (taukwa) (RWT) and rice with chicken (RWC). The control meal consisted of 50 g of available carbohydrate, whereas all other test meals contained additional 25 g of protein. RWT was the only meal that showed significantly lower glucose response when compared with the control (P<0·05). RWF and RWE had significantly higher insulin response, but no significant increase was observed in RWT and RWC when compared with the control (P<0·05). RWT and RWF showed significantly higher glucagon secretion as compared with the control (P<0·05). The four test meals studied showed varying effects, with RWT showing the greatest reduction in glycaemic response. Therefore, the ingestion of soya beancurd with rice may have a direct impact on reducing the risk in Asians transiting from being pre-diabetics to diabetics. "
2019,30878553,Late autophagy inhibitor chloroquine improves efficacy of the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA and temozolomide in gliomas.,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor associated with few therapeutic opportunities and poor prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of combining temozolomide (TMZ) with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) - a specific histone deacetylases inhibitor - in glioma models in vitro and in vivo. In glioma cell lines, combined TMZ/SAHA promoted more cytotoxicity, G2/M arrest and apoptosis than either drugs alone. G2/M arrest was detected as soon as 24 h post drug exposure and preceded apoptosis, which occurred from 72 h treatment. TMZ and SAHA, alone or combined, also stimulated autophagy as evaluated by means of acridine orange staining and immunodetection of LC3I-II conversion and p62/SQSTM1 degradation. Time-course of autophagy accompanied G2/M arrest and preceded apoptosis, and blockage of late steps of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) augmented SAHA/TMZ toxicity leading to apoptosis. In orthotopic gliomas in vivo, combined SAHA/TMZ showed better antitumor efficacy than either drugs alone, and adding CQ to the regimen improved antiglioma effects of SAHA and TMZ monotherapies without further benefit on combined SAHA/TMZ. In summary, the herein presented data suggest that autophagy acts as a protective response that impairs efficacy of SAHA and TMZ. Inhibiting autophagy termination with CQ may offer means to improve antitumor effects of SAHA and TMZ in gliomas and possibly other cancers."
2012,22143126,Warfarin resistance associated with parenteral nutrition.,"Warfarin is widely used as an oral anticoagulant for the prevention and long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement and myocardial infarction. Warfarin exerts its anticoagulation effect by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for the cyclic interconversion of vitamin K in the liver. Vitamin K serves as a cofactor required for the carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins. By inhibiting the supply of vitamin K in the production of these proteins, warfarin indirectly slows their rate of synthesis. The authors describe a 46-year-old patient readily anticoagulated for a deep venous thrombosis who then required large doses of warfarin after initiation of total parenteral nutrition, which included lipid preparation that contained vitamin K, in addition to vitamin K required for the daily parenteral nutrition. The effect of total parenteral nutrition with vitamin K on anticoagulation is discussed."
2012,22659736,Berry anthocyanidins synergistically suppress growth and invasive potential of human non-small-cell lung cancer cells.,"Berry anthocyanidins (cyanidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin and delphinidin) have increasingly been explored for their anticancer effects; however, their combinatorial effects as a mixture, as present in blueberry, bilberry and Indian blackberry ('Jamun') remain untested. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the combination of suboptimal concentrations of equimolar anthocyanidins synergistically inhibited growth of two aggressive non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, with minimal effects on non-tumorigenic cell viability. The induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and suppression of NSCLC cell invasion and migration were also significantly greater with the mixture than individual anthocyanidins. The superior effects of the combinatorial treatment presumably resulted from its effects on the oncogenic Notch and WNT pathways and their downstream targets (β-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, pERK, MMP9 and VEGF proteins), enhanced cleavage of the apoptotic mediators Bcl2 and PARP and enhanced inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-kappa B activation. In vivo, both the native mixture of anthocyanidins from bilberry (0.5mg/mouse) and the most potent anthocyanidin, delphinidin (1.5mg/mouse) significantly inhibited the growth of H1299 xenografts in nude miceby ≈60%. Notably, the effective dose of delphinidin in the anthocyanidin mixture was 8-fold lower than delphinidin alone, further emphasizing synergism. Our results thus demonstrate therapeutic potential of berries rich in this mixture of diverse anthocyanidins for non-small-cell lung cancer treatment and to prevent its future recurrence and metastasis."
2010,20494511,A novel compound modified from tanshinone inhibits tumor growth in vivo via activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.,"A novel compound, acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA) was obtained from chemical modifications of tanshinone TIIA (TIIA) isolated from a medicinal plant, Salvia miltiorrhiza. ATA exhibited increased water solubility and stronger apoptotic activity on multiple cancer cell lines than TIIA. ATA displayed a higher growth inhibition ability on breast cancer especially HER2 positive cells than normal cells and it inhibited xenografted tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies showed that ATA could induce significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Bax translocation to mitochondria, resulting in mitochondria damage, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death. ATA-mediated ROS production and its downstream apoptotic events could be blocked by an antioxidant agent, propyl gallate, indicating the prominent role of ROS in ATA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein reduced ATA-induced cell death. In conclusion, ATA is a novel anticancer agent with potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer ability. ROS-mediated Bax activation should be the mechanism by which ATA induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth."
2012,29243645,Structural identification of isomallotusinin and other phenolics in Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit hull.,"The air-dried fruit hull of Phyllanthus emblica L. was extracted with 95% ethanol, and then the extract was partitioned by diethyl ether and ethyl acetate (EA). The EA fraction was then subjected to separation and purification using silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography repeatedly to obtain five hydrolysable tannins. They were identified as mucic acid 1,4-lactone 3-o-gallate (C1), isocorilagin (C2), chebulanin (C3), chebulagic acid (C4) and isomallotusinin (C5) using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Isomallotusinin and chebulanin were identified from emblica dried fruit hull for the first time, and isomallotusinin was the first time identified from Phyllanthus. Furthermore, the antioxidant abilities of these hydrolysable tannins were investigated using DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging systems. All hydrolysable tannins showed strong DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging activities. Isomallotusinin and chebulagic acid exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other purified compounds tested."
2005,15746084,Angiopoietin-1 promotes lymphatic sprouting and hyperplasia.,"Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, regulates the formation and stabilization of the blood vessel network during embryogenesis. In adults, Ang1 is associated with blood vessel stabilization and recruitment of perivascular cells, whereas Ang2 acts to counter these actions. Recent results from gene-targeted mice have shown that Ang2 is also essential for the proper patterning of lymphatic vessels and that Ang1 can be substituted for this function. In order to characterize the effects of the angiopoietins on lymphatic vessels, we employed viral vectors for overexpression of Ang1 in adult mouse tissues. We found that Ang1 activated lymphatic vessel endothelial proliferation, vessel enlargement, and generation of long endothelial cell filopodia that eventually fused, leading to new sprouts and vessel development. Cutaneous lymphatic hyperplasia was also detected in transgenic mice expressing Ang1 in the basal epidermal cells. Tie2 was expressed in the lymphatic endothelial cells and Ang1 stimulation of these cells resulted in up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3). Furthermore, a soluble form of VEGFR-3 inhibited the observed lymphatic sprouting. Our results reinforce the concept that Ang1 therapy may be useful in settings of tissue edema."
2010,20361314,Activation of CREB by St. John's wort may diminish deletorious effects of aging on spatial memory.,"St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is one of the leading psychotherapeutic phytomedicines. Beneficial effects of this herb in the treatment of mild to moderate depression are well known. In this study we tested a hypothesis that St. John's wort alleviates age-related memory impairments by increasing the levels of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in hippocampus. Middleaged rats (18 month-old) displayed a decline in the acquisition of spatial working memory (p < 0.001) in the Morris water maze (MWM). Chronic administration of Hypericum perforatum (HP) (350 mg/kg for 21 days), potently and significantly improved the processing of spatial information in the aged rats (p < 0.001). Also the herb increased the levels of pCREB in the aged rat's hippocampus (p < 0.01) as measured by western immunoblotting. Aging caused significant locomotor impairments as tested in the open field (p < 0.001) but not in the MWM test. However, these were unaffected by treatment with HP. Thus, this study indicates that St. John's wort effectively prevents aging-induced deterioration of spatial memory in 18 month-old rats, possibly by the activation of CREB regulated genes associated with memory formation. It appears that mechanism is probably inactive in young rats."
2016,27614131,"Intracellular zinc status influences cisplatin-induced endothelial permeability through modulation of PKCα, NF-κB and ICAM-1 expression.","Platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen induces vascular dysfunction. Action of cisplatin on endothelial cells is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC-α), which further activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and induces canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC1) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression. Increased ICAM-1 contributes to hyperadhesion of monocytes and endothelial dysfunction. PKC-α is also involved in phosphorylation of TRPC1, resulting in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and further activation of NF-κB. Although the role of altered intracellular zinc status is not known in cisplatin-induced vascular dysfunction, because of the ability of zinc to modulate PKC-α, NF-κB activity, we hypothesized that zinc can ameliorate the extent of endothelial dysfunction induced by cisplatin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with cisplatin (8.0μg/ml) showed lowered intracellular free zinc, concomitant with enhanced activation of PKC-α, NF-κΒ activation, TRPC1, SOCE and ICAM-1 levels. Zinc deficiency per se induced using membrane permeable chelator (TPEN) mimicked the cisplatin-induced PKC-α, NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression, but also activated Activator Protein-1 (AP-1). Zinc supplementation (2.0-10.0μM) to the endothelial cells during cisplatin treatment or TPEN-induced zinc deficiency suppressed PKC-α, NF-κB, TRPC1, SOCE activation and lowered the ICAM-1 expression. Zinc supplementation thereby effectively decreased the cisplatin-induced endothelial permeability and adherence of the activated endothelial cells to U937 monocytes."
1993,8237846,Hemostatic factors and blood lipids in young Buddhist vegetarians and omnivores.,"A comparison was made between the hemostatic and lipid profiles of 55 young Chinese Buddhist vegetarians (23 men, 32 women) and 59 Chinese medical students (20 men, 39 women) aged 20-30 y. The modern Buddhist vegetarian diet is high in carbohydrate (63% of energy in men, 58% in women) and has a high polyunsaturated-saturated fatty acid ratio, with moderate fat content (25% for men, 30% for women). Rice and soybean proteins are the major protein sources. This study demonstrated that the major beneficial effects of a modern Buddhist vegetarian diet are on blood concentrations of cholesterol, the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B, glucose, and uric acid, but not on most hemostatic factors studied, which included fibrinogen, factor VIIc, factor VIIIc, and plasminogen. Vegetarian men had significantly higher concentrations of antithrombin III than nonvegetarian men."
2019,31483702,Pyridoxine and pancreatic acinar cells: transport physiology and effect on gene expression profile.,"Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), an essential micronutrient for normal cell physiology, plays an important role in the function of the exocrine pancreas. Pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) obtain vitamin B6 from circulation, but little is known about the mechanism involved in the uptake process; limited information also exists on the effect of pyridoxine availability on the gene expression profile in these cells. We addressed both these issues in the current investigation using mouse-derived pancreatic acinar 266-6 cells (PAC 266-6) and human primary PACs (hPACs; obtained from organ donors), together with appropriate physiological and molecular (RNA-Seq) approaches. The results showed [3H]pyridoxine uptake to be 1) pH and temperature (but not Na+) dependent, 2) saturable as a function of concentration, 3) cis-inhibited by unlabeled pyridoxine and its close structural analogs, 4) trans-stimulated by unlabeled pyridoxine, 5) regulated by an intracellular Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated pathway, 6) adaptively-regulated by extracellular substrate (pyridoxine) availability, and 7) negatively impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke extract. Vitamin B6 availability was found (by means of RNA-Seq) to significantly (FDR < 0.05) modulate the expression profile of many genes in PAC 266-6 cells (including those that are relevant to pancreatic health and development). These studies demonstrate, for the first time, the involvement of a regulatable and specific carrier-mediated mechanism for pyridoxine uptake by PACs; the results also show that pyridoxine availability exerts profound effects on the gene expression profile in mammalian PACs."
2016,26199281,"High-dose testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone induce cardiotoxicity in rats: Assessment of echocardiographic, morphologic, and oxidative stress parameters.","The aim of this study is to assess cardiotoxic effect of testosterone (TES) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in Sprague Dawley rats. We compared the impact of subacute (14 days) and subchronic (90 days) administration of suprapharmacologic doses of TES and DHEA on body weight, locomotor activity, muscle strength, echocardiographic parameters, heart histopathology, and oxidative stress markers with the control group. Testosterone (10, 30, and 100 mg/100 g body weight) and DHEA (10 mg/100 g body weight) administration decreased the body weights and locomotor activity (p < 0.05), and the combination of both increased muscle strength (p < 0.05) in rats. In our histopathological evaluation, misshapen cell nuclei, disorganized myocardial fibers, and leukocytic infiltrates were observed in high-dose TES (100 mg/100 g)-treated rats, especially on day 14. On day 90, mild changes such as misshapen cell nuclei, disorganized myocardial fibers, and leukocytic infiltrates were observed in TES and DHEA-treated groups. According to our echocardiographic study on day 14 and day 90, TES, especially at high doses, induced increase in left ventricular posterior wall diameter and ejection fraction (p < 0.05). In this study, blood oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde was increased slightly but not significantly in TES and DHEA groups. On the other hand, antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were slightly but not significantly increased in TES and DHEA groups. These data demonstrate that the potential risk to cardiac health due to exogenous androgen use may be related to oxidative stress in rats. "
2019,31205333,Impact of Implementing Smart Infusion Pumps in an Intensive Care Unit in Mexico: A Pre-Post Cost Analysis Based on Intravenous Solutions Consumption.,"Background: The use of smart pump technology has shown to be profitable in the intensive care unit (ICU) because it avoids costs from prevented medication errors and allows for savings on disposables and medications by establishing standardized concentrations and dosing units. Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the economic impact of the implementation of smart infusion pumps in the consumption of intravenous (IV) solutions in an ICU. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted with a pre-post design. The study occurred in the adult ICU of the Hospital Juárez de México. The pattern of consumption of IV solutions (sodium chloride 9%, Hartmann's solution, dextrose 5% and 10%, sodium chloride 0.9% with dextrose 5%) was analyzed preimplementation and postimplementation of 50 Plum A+™ pumps with Hospira MedNet™ security software. Using the TreeAge Pro 2016 software, deterministic and probabilistic analyses were carried out (10 000 Monte Carlo simulations) to confirm the robustness of the annual consumption comparison and the associated expenses before and after implementing smart technology. Results: The implementation of the smart pumps reduced the annual consumption of IV solutions to 8994 units (18%) and 3649 liters (22.3%). In the first year, MXN$55 850.97 were saved. From an institutional perspective and with a probability of 0.63, the use of MedNet™ technology proved to be a lower cost alternative (17.1% saved) with respect to the conventional infusion systems. Conclusion: The implementation of smart infusion pumps allows savings, specifically for the IV solutions used in ICU."
2013,23870864,Protective role of Punica granatum (pomegranate) peel and seed oil extracts on diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital-induced hepatic injury in male rats.,"The present study is an attempt to reveal the protective role of Punica granatum peel and seed oil extracts against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and phenobarbital (PB) induced hepatic injury in rats. DEN administration increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 and glutathione reductase (GSR) activities, while the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and total glutathione peroxidase (t-GPx) were decreased compared with the control. Treatment with peel and seed oil extracts pre, during and post DEN administration improved liver functions, decreased the levels of MDA, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 and GSR activities with an elevation in levels of GSH, SOD, GST and t-GPx activities. This indicates that these extracts reduced the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by DEN. Also the effect of administration of PE and SOE separately for a long time (23 weeks) on healthy rats was studied."
2014,24884823,"Phenolic contents, antioxidant and anticholinesterase potentials of crude extract, subsequent fractions and crude saponins from Polygonum hydropiper L.","We investigated Polygonum hydropiper L. (P. hydropiper) for phenolic contents, antioxidant, anticholinesterase activities, in an attempt to rationalize its use in neurological disorders.Plant crude extract (Ph.Cr), its subsequent fractions: n-hexane (Ph.Hex), chloroform (Ph.Chf), ethyl acetate (Ph.EtAc), n-Butanol (Ph.Bt), aqueous (Ph.Aq) and saponins (Ph.Sp) were evaluated for 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radical scavenging potential. Further, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) & butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities were performed using Ellman's assay. Moreover, total phenolic contents of plant extracts were determined and expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry sample (mg GAE/g dry weight).Among different fractions, Ph.Cr (90.82), Ph.Chf (178.16), Ph.EtAc (203.44) and Ph.Bt (153.61) exhibited high phenolic contents. All fractions showed concentration dependent DPPH scavenging activity, with Ph.EtAc 71.33% (IC50 15 μg/ml), Ph.Bt 71.40% (IC50 3 μg/ml) and Ph.Sp 71.40% (IC50 35 μg/ml) were most potent. The plant extracts exhibited high ABTS scavenging ability i.e. Ph.Bt (91.03%), Ph.EtAc (90.56%), Ph.Sp (90.84%), Ph.Aq (90.56%) with IC50<0.01 μg/ml. All fractions showed moderate to high AChE inhibitory activity as; Ph.Cr, 86.87% (IC50 330 μg/ml), Ph.Hex, 87.49% (IC50 35 μg/ml), Ph.Chf, 84.76% (IC50 55 μg/ml), Ph.Sp, 87.58% (IC50 108 μg/ml) and Ph.EtAc 79.95% (IC50 310 μg/ml) at 1 mg/ml). Furthermore the BChE inhibitory activity was most prominent in Ph.Hex 90.30% (IC50 40 μg/ml), Ph.Chf 85.94% (IC50 215 μg/ml), Ph.Aq 87.62% (IC50 3 μg/ml) and Ph.EtAc 81.01% (IC50 395 μg/ml) fractions.In this study, for the first time, we determined phenolic contents, isolated crude saponins, investigated antioxidant and anticholinestrase potential of P. hydropiper extracts. The results indicate that P. hydropiper is enriched with potent bioactive compounds and warrant further investigation by isolation and structural elucidation to find novel and affordable compounds for the treatment of various neurological disorders."
2000,10771138,The influence of cadmium and zinc ions on the interferon and tumor necrosis factor production in bovine aorta endothelial cells.,"The influence of CdCl(2), used at 1, 10 and 100 microM concentration, and ZnCl(2) at 1, 10 and 100 microM concentration on the production of interferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAECs) was examined. BAECs were treated with cadmium ions or zinc ions alone or together with cytokine inducers: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cadmium ions at 1 and 10 microM concentration, used alone induced a low, but detectable TNF activity in BAECs, and zinc ions at 1, 10 and 100 microM concentration induced both IFN and TNF activity. In contrast to that, cadmium added to BAECs together with the virus or LPS as cytokine inducers significantly inhibited the production of IFN and TNF. Cadmium effect depended on the concentration used, and 1 and 10 microM CdCl(2) partially, but 100 microM cadmium completely inhibited the production of both cytokines. Zinc ions at 1 and 10 microM concentration, which only slightly inhibited the production of both cytokines, did not reconstitute cadmium-depressed IFN and TNF production. These data indicate that cadmium-induced depression of cytokine production in bovine endothelial cells, in response to viral and bacterial stimuli, cannot be reversed by zinc supplementation."
2017,28088220,"Anti-inflammatory potential of ellagic acid, gallic acid and punicalagin A&B isolated from Punica granatum.","Punica granatum (pomegranate), an edible fruit originating in the Middle East, has been used as a traditional medicine for treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions such as peptic ulcer. The numerous risks associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment of pain and inflammation give rise to using medicinal herbs as alternative therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of isolated compounds from the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction of P. granatum by determination of their inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), stimulated nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxxgenase-2 (COX-2) release from RAW264.7 cells.The compounds ellagic acid, gallic acid and punicalagin A&B were isolated from EtOAc by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The inhibitory effect of ellagic acid, gallic acid and punicalagin A&B were evaluated on the production of LPS-induced NO by Griess reagent, PGE-2 and IL-6 by immunoassay kit and prostaglandin E2 competitive ELISA kit, and COX-2 by Western blotting.Ellagic acid, gallic acid and punicalagin A&B potentially inhibited LPS-induced NO, PGE-2 and IL-6 production.The results indicate that ellagic acid, gallic acid and punicalagin may be the compounds responsible for the anti-inflammatory potential of P. granatum."

2010,19902160,Prophylactic efficacy of Coriandrum sativum (Coriander) on testis of lead-exposed mice.,"Lead poisoning is a worldwide health problem, and its treatment is under investigation. The aim of this study was to access the efficacy of Coriandrum sativum (coriander) in reducing lead-induced changes in mice testis. Animal exposed to lead nitrate showed significant decrease in testicular SOD, CAT, GSH, total protein, and tissue lead level. This was accompanied by simultaneous increase in the activities of LPO, AST, ALT, ACP, ALP, and cholesterol level. Serum testosterone level and sperm density were suppressed in lead-treated group compared with the control. These influences of lead were prevented by concurrent daily administration of C. sativum extracts to some extent. Treating albino mice with lead-induced various histological changes in the testis and treatment with coriander led to an improvement in the histological testis picture. The results thus led us to conclude that administration of C. sativum significantly protects against lead-induced oxidative stress. Further work need to be done to isolate and purify the active principle involved in the antioxidant activity of this plant."
,7840509,Abnormal production of androgens in women with breast cancer.,"Two long and broad streams of medical literature, from the 1950's to date, have established the existence of two unrelated abnormalities of androgen production in women with breast cancer. One is the genetically determined presence of subnormal production of adrenal androgens (i.e. DHEA and DHEAS) in women with premenopausal breast cancer and their sisters, who are at increased risk for breast cancer. The other is excessive production of testosterone, of ovarian origin, in subsets of women with either premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer and women with atypical breast-duct hyperplasia, who are at increased risk for breast cancer; along with the hypertestosteronism, there is frequently chronic anovulation in the premenopausal patients. The combination of ovarian hypertestosteronism and chronic anovulation is characteristic of the polycystic ovary syndrome and is also frequently seen in women with abdominal (""android"") obesity; both PCOS and abdominal obesity are known to be characterized by high risk for postmenopausal cancer. The elevated testosterone levels and the increased levels of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II that are seen in PCOS and abdominal obesity could favor the development of breast cancer in several ways, all of which have been demonstrated experimentally: binding of testosterone to cancer cells bearing testosterone receptors, with direct stimulation; intratissular aromatization of testosterone to estradiol, with stimulation of estrogen-sensitive cells; stimulation of the production of epithelial growth factor (EGF) by testosterone, with direct mitogenic effect of EGF on cancer cells; stimulation of aromatase by insulin and IGF-I; direct mitogenic stimulation of cancer cells by insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II; and stimulation by IGF-I and IGF-II of the intratissular reduction of estrone to estradiol. Since PCOS is probably largely genetically determined, and abdominal obesity may also be, the hypertestosteronism of these conditions may represent a second genetically determined hormonal risk factor for breast cancer."
2000,10807776,In vitro differentiation of endothelial cells from AC133-positive progenitor cells.,"Recent findings support the hypothesis that the CD34(+)-cell population in bone marrow and peripheral blood contains hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor and stem cells. In this study, we report that human AC133(+) cells from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells (ECs). When cultured in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the novel cytokine stem cell growth factor (SCGF), AC133(+) progenitors generate both adherent and proliferating nonadherent cells. Phenotypic analysis of the cells within the adherent population reveals that the majority display endothelial features, including the expression of KDR, Tie-2, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1, and von Willebrand factor. Electron microscopic studies of these cells show structures compatible with Weibel-Palade bodies that are found exclusively in vascular endothelium. AC133-derived nonadherent cells give rise to both hematopoietic and endothelial colonies in semisolid medium. On transfer to fresh liquid culture with VEGF and SCGF, nonadherent cells again produce an adherent and a nonadherent population. In mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, AC133-derived cells form new blood vessels in vivo when injected subcutaneously together with A549 lung cancer cells. These data indicate that the AC133(+)-cell population consists of progenitor and stem cells not only with hematopoietic potential but also with the capacity to differentiate into ECs. Whether these hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors develop from a common precursor, the hemangioblast will be studied at the single-cell level."
2019,29683006,"Ocimum basilicum affects tracheal responsiveness, lung inflammatory cells and oxidant-antioxidant biomarkers in sensitized rats.","The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Ocimum basilicum (O. basilicum) was shown previously. In the present study, the effect of O. basilicum on tracheal responsiveness (TR) to methacholine and ovalbumin (OVA), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of oxidant-antioxidant biomarkers as well as total and differential white blood cell (WBC) in sensitized rats was examined. Six groups of rats including control (group C), sensitized rats to OVA (group S), S groups treated with three concentrations of O. basilicum (0.75, 1.50, and 3.00 mg/ml) and one concentration of dexamethasone (1.25 μg/ml) (n = 8 for all groups) were studied. TR to methacholine and OVA, total WBC count, percentages of eosinophils, monocytes, neutrophils, and levels of oxidant biomarkers were significantly increased but other measured parameters were significantly decreased in group S compared to group C. TR to methacholine and OVA, percentages of eosinophils, monocytes, neutrophils, and levels of oxidant biomarkers were significantly decreased but lymphocytes and antioxidant biomarkers were significantly increased in S groups treated with dexamethasone and at least two higher concentrations of the extract compared to group S. Total WBC count was also decreased in treated S groups with dexamethasone and high extract concentration. The effect of extract on most measured parameters was significantly lower than dexamethasone treatment. The effects of two higher concentrations of the extract on most variables were significantly higher than the effect of low extract concentration. These results showed the concentration-dependent effect of O. basilicum on tracheal responses, lung inflammatory cells, and oxidant-antioxidant parameters in sensitized rats."
1979,464702,Effect of parathyroidectomy on anemia in chronic renal failure.,"Fourteen patients with chronic renal failure underwent parathyroidectomy. Postoperatively, seven patients exhibited a rise in hematocrit reading, but seven others did not. Responders had more severe bone disease and lower initial hematocrit values than did nonresponders. Marrow fibrosis was slightly more prominent in responders. Current concepts of marrow erythropoietic inhibition in renal failure suggest a toxic serum factor as the cause. This report fails to support parathyroid hormone as the toxic agent directly responsible for marrow inhibition. Rather, parathyroid hormone may contribute to anemia in renal failure by causing marrow fibrosis, a process sometimes reversible by successful therapy of hyperparathyroidism."
2015,25053030,"Effects of industrial canning on the proximate composition, bioactive compounds contents and nutritional profile of two Spanish common dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).","This study investigated the changes produced by canning in the proximate composition and in the bioactive constituents of two ""ready to eat"" Spanish beans. The foremost difference in the raw beans corresponded to the lectin: a higher content was found in raw Curruquilla beans (16.50 mg 100 mg(-1)) compared with raw Almonga beans (0.6 mg 100 mg(-1)). In general, industrial canning significantly increased the protein (>7%) and dietary fibre (>5%) contents of both beans varieties. However, the minerals, total α-galactosides and inositol phosphates contents were reduced (>25%) in both canned seeds. The trypsin inhibitors content was almost abolished by canning, and no lectins were found in either of the canned samples. Canned Curruquilla showed a decrease (38%) of their antioxidant activity. These ""ready to eat"" beans exhibited adequate nutritive profiles according to the USDA dietary recommendations. Furthermore, they had bioactive components content that are suitable for establishing a healthy lifestyle."
,12894570,Fungal beta-(1-3)-D-glucan derivatives exhibit high antioxidative and antimutagenic activity in vitro.,"The antioxidative activity and antimutagenic effects of the water-soluble beta-(1-3)-D-glucan derivatives from biotechnologically important species, in particular carboxymethyl-glucan (CM-G) and sulfoethyl-glucan (SE-G) both from the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and carboxymethyl-chitin-glucan (CM-CG) from filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, were evaluated. The luminol-dependent photochemical method using trolox as a standard showed that CM-CG, SE-G and CM-G possessed high antioxidative properties. CM-CG exhibited the highest antioxidative activity (2.15 +/- 0.14 nmol exhibits the same activity as 1 nmol of trolox), followed by SE-G (2.99 +/- 0.15 nmol) and CM-G (4.59 +/- 0.14 nmol). These glucans were experimentally confirmed to exhibit different, statistically significant activity in reducing the damage of chloroplast DNA of the flagellate Euglena gracilis induced by ofloxacin and acridine orange. Our findings suggest that the antimutagenic effect of CM-CG, SE-G and CM-G against ofloxacin is based on their antioxidative capability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (p < 0.001). As far as acridine orange is concerned, the reduction of the chloroplast DNA lesion could be a result of the absorptive capacity of the glucans (p < 0.001). We found out that the water-soluble beta-(1-3)-D-glucan derivatives possess very high antioxidative activity as well as expressive antimutagenic effects, exerted through different mode of action."
2015,25967728,Prevention of vascular damage with Lisosan G wheat extract: the in vitro basis for a clinical investigation.,"Vascular damage and impairment play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nutraceutical supplements might have a role in reducing vascular damage, provided that their efficacy is proven by controlled studies and is supported by a mechanistic rationale. Therefore, the use of nutraceutical supplements can have some effects also in the prevention of NFLD. Epidemiological evidence correlates the intake of whole grain and whole-grain products with a reduced occurrence of vascular disease. Lisosan G is a powder obtained from Triticum Sativum (wheat), which is registered with the Italian Ministry of Health as a nutritional supplement. In vivo, Lisosan G has been shown to protect against cisplatin induced toxicity, and the use of this compound in the prevention of cirrhosis and steatosis has been recently been proposed thanks to its marked anti-oxidant activity. We discuss here the rationale for further investigation on this compound in the prevention of NAFLD."
1987,3826838,Pharmacokinetics and tissue residues of gentamicin in lactating cows after multiple intramuscular doses are administered.,"Gentamicin was administered IM to 6 healthy, mature, lactating cows at a dosage of 3.5 or 5 mg/kg of body weight every 8 hours for 10 consecutive days (total, 30 doses). Endometrial biopsies were done at 72, 136 or 144, and 216 hours after the first dose was administered. On the 10th day, just before the last dose of gentamicin was administered, blood samples (designated 10th-day base-line samples) were obtained, and serial blood samples were obtained for 144 hours after the last injection was given. The cows were catheterized on the 10th day, and urine was obtained for 10 to 18 consecutive hours. Milk samples were also obtained. The cows were slaughtered at different times after the last dose was given, and samples were taken from 22 tissues and organs. Serum, milk, urine, and tissue gentamicin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Serum gentamicin concentrations were best fitted to a 2-compartment open model. The mean half-lives for absorption, distribution, and elimination were 0.16 +/- 0.14, 2.59 +/- 0.53, and 44.91 +/- 9.38 hours, respectively. Total body clearance and renal clearance were 1.65 +/- 0.69 and 1.32 +/- 0.25 ml/min/kg, respectively. The percentage of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine at 8 hours after the last dose was given was 98 +/- 15. As expected, of the tissues examined, the gentamicin concentrations in the kidney cortex and medulla were 1,500 times greater than those in serum. Renal function remained within the baseline range during the 10 days of gentamicin treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2007,17603179,Bacampicillin uptake is shared with thiamine in Caco-2 cells.,"Bacampicillin was developed as a prodrug to improve the intestinal absorption of its metabolite ampicillin. This study was undertaken to characterize bacampicillin transport in Caco-2 cells. The uptake of bacampicillin in Caco-2 cells was significantly greater than those of ampicillin and pivampicillin. An Eadie-Hofstee plot obtained from 5-min uptake of 0.2-5 mM bacampicillin was linear, indicating the presence of a saturable transport system for bacampicillin with K(m) and V(max) of 3.6 mM and 23.9 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively. Hydrophilic organic cations such as choline, cimetidine, guanidine, nicotinamide, 1-methylnicotiamide, and tetraethylammonium failed to modulate bacampicillin uptake in Caco-2 cells whereas diphenhydramine, procainamide, and thiamine significantly depressed it. Moreover, when thiamine was preloaded in Caco-2 cells, bacampicillin uptake was significantly increased, indicating that this cationic vitamin was capable of trans-stimulating bacampicillin transport across the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells. However, trans-stimulated bacampicillin uptake was not observed in the presence of diphenhydramine. Bacampicillin uptake increased with elevation of the medium pH, and the known modulators of thiamine transport such as amiloride and oxythiamine significantly inhibited bacampicillin uptake. Thiamine also significantly decreased the apical-to-basolateral transport of bacampicillin across Caco-2 cell monolayers. However, thiamine did not exert any modulating effect on pivampicillin uptake and its apical-to-basolateral permeation in Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that bacampicillin is transported in Caco-2 cells, sharing a carrier-mediated system with thiamine."
2005,16327145,"Ginkgetin, a Biflavone from Ginko biloba leaves, inhibits cyclooxygenases-2 and 5-lipoxygenase in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells.","Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was previously reported to be a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor and this compound showed the potent antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis as well as analgesic activity. This investigation was carried out to find effects on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vitro effect. Ginkgetin inhibits COX-2 dependent phases of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) generation in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) values of 0.75 microM. Western blotting probed with specific anti-COX-2 antibodies showed that the decrease in quantity of the PGD(2) product was accompanied by a decrease in the COX-2 protein level. In addition, this compound consistently inhibited the production of leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) in a dose dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 0.33 microM. These results demonstrate that ginkgetin has a dual cyclooxygenase-2/5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, this compound also inhibited degranulation reaction in a dose dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 6.52 microM. Therefore, this compound might provide a basis for novel anti-inflammatory agents."
2011,21843511,Biochemical disorders associated with antiproliferative effect of dehydroepiandrosterone in hepatoma cells as revealed by LC-based metabolomics.,"DHEA is known to have chemopreventive and antiproliferative activities, and was initially thought to be mediated by inhibition of G6PD. Our previous study has shown that DHEA may act through interference with energy metabolism. To study the effect of pharmacological dose of DHEA on cellular metabolism, and to further delineate the mechanism underlying its antiproliferative effect, we applied a metabolomic approach to globally profile the changes in metabolites in SK-Hep1 cells underexpressing G6PD (Sk-Gi) and control cells (Sk-Sc) after DHEA treatment. RRLC-TOF-MS was used to identify metabolites, and tandem mass spectrometry was used to confirm their identity. DHEA induced changes in glutathione metabolism, lipid metabolism, s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism, as well as lysine metabolism. Elevation in level of glutathione disulfide, together with a concomitant decrease in level of reduced glutathione, was indicative of increased oxidative stress. Depletion of carnitine and its acyl derivatives reflected decline in fatty acid catabolism. These changes were associated with mitochondrial malfunction and reduction in cellular ATP content. Cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels decreased significantly, suggesting that alterations in lipid composition are causally related to decline in mitochondrial function after DHEA treatment. The decline in cellular SAM content was accompanied by decreased expression of methionine adenosyltransferase genes MAT2A and MAT2B. SAM supplementation partially rescued cells from DHEA-induced growth stagnation. Our findings suggest that DHEA causes perturbation of multiple pathways in cellular metabolism. Decreased SAM production, and cardiolipin depletion and the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction underlie the antiproliferative effect of DHEA."
2010,20670616,"3β-hydroxylup-20(29)-ene-27,28-dioic acid dimethyl ester, a novel natural product from Plumbago zeylanica inhibits the proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.","Plumbago zeylanica, a traditional Indian herb is being used for the therapy of rheumatism and has been approved for anti-tumor activity. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the biological action are not very well understood. In this study, the anti-invasive activities of P. zeylanica methanolic extract (PME) and pure compound 3β-hydroxylup-20(29)-ene-27,28-dioic acid (PZP) isolated from it are investigated in vitro. PME and PZP were noted to have the ability to induce apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometry. Further, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by PME and PZP was found by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential with the down regulation of Bcl-2, increased expression of Bad, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP leading to DNA fragmentation. Importantly, both PME and PZP were observed to suppress MDA-MB-231 cells adhesion to the fibronectin-coated substrate and also inhibited the wound healing migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through the reconstituted extracellular matrix. Gelatin zymography revealed that PME and PZP decreased the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9). Interestingly both PME and PZP exerted an inhibitory effect on the protein levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF and HIF-1α that are consistent with the observed anti-metastatic effect. Collectively, these data provide the molecular basis of the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of PME and PZP."
2007,18038903,Influence of polyphenolic compounds isolated from Rubus coreanum on catecholamine release in the rat adrenal medulla.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether polyphenolic compounds isolated from wine brewed from Rubus coreanum MIQUEL (PCRC) may affect the release of catecholamine (CA) from the isolated perfused rat adrenal medulla, and to establish its mechanism of action. PCRC (20-180 microg/mL) perfused into an adrenal vein for 90 min dose- and time-dependently inhibited the CA secretory responses evoked by acetylcholine (ACh, 5.32 mM), high K+ (a direct membrane-depolarizer, 56 mM), DMPP (a selective neuronal nicotinic Nn receptor agonist, 100 microM) and McN-A-343 (a selective muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, 100 microM). Also, in the presence of PCRC (60 microg/mL), the secretory responses of CA evoked by Bay-K-8644 (a L-type dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel activator, 10 microM), and cyclopiazonic acid (a cytoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, 10 microM) were significantly reduced, respectively. In the simultaneous presence of PCRC (60 microg/mL) and L-NAME (an inhibitor of NO synthase, 30 microM), the inhibitory responses of PCRC on the CA secretion evoked by ACh, high K+, DMPP, and Bay-K-8644 were considerably recovered to the extent of the corresponding control secretion compared with the inhibitory effect of PCRC alone. Taken together, these results obtained from the present study demonstrate that PCRC inhibits the CA secretory responses from the isolated perfused adrenal gland of the normotensive rats evoked by stimulation of cholinergic (both muscarinic and nicotinic) receptors as well as by direct membrane-depolarization. It seems that this inhibitory effect of PCRC is exerted by inhibiting both the calcium influx into the rat adrenal medullary chromaffin cells and the uptake of Ca2+ into the cytoplasmic calcium store partly through the increased NO production due to the activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which are at least relevant to the direct interaction with the nicotinic receptor itself. It is also thought that PCRC might be effective in prevention of cardiovascular disease."
2015,25986145,Warfarin Metabolites in Patients Following Cardiac Valve Implantation: A Contribution of Clinical and Genetic Factors.,"Warfarin, a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers, is the cornerstone of therapy in patients following cardiac valve replacement. S-warfarin is metabolized to 7-S-hydroxywarfarin by the cytochrome P450 isoform 2C9 encoded by CYP2C9 gene. R-warfarin is metabolized by multiple cytochromes P450. We sought to assess the impact of clinical and genetic factors on circulating warfarin metabolites following valve implantation.Venous blood was collected from 120 patients after 3 months since elective mitral and/or aortic valve replacement. Plasma S-warfarin, R-warfarin, S-7-hydroxywarfarin, and R-7-hydroxywarfarin were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The S-7-hydroxywarfarin/S-warfarin and S-warfarin/R-warfarin (S/R) ratios, along with warfarin sensitivity index (WSI), defined as INR/S-warfarin ratio, were calculated. Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) c.-1639A, CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*2 alleles were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction.The S-warfarin was higher in former smokers (p = 0.047) and the VKORC1 c.-1639A allele carriers (p < 0.0001). The S-7-hydroxywarfarin was lower in carriers of the VKORC1 c.-1639A allele (p = 0.0005) and CYP2C9*3 (p = 0.047). The S-7-hydroxywarfarin/S-warfarin ratio was lower in the carriers of CYP2C9*3 (p = 0.008), but not in those with VKORC1 -c.1639A allele. The S/R ratio was higher in patients with hypertension (p = 0.01). The independent predictors of elevated S/R ratio defined as the upper quartile were diabetes (p = 0.045), CYP2C9*3 (p < 0.0001) and CYP2C9*2 (p = 0.0002). The independent predictors of elevated WSI were current smoking (p = 0.049), implantation of mechanical valve (p = 0.006) and VKORC1c.-1639A allele (p = 0.007).We conclude that not only genetic, but also several clinical factors affect warfarin metabolites in patients following cardiac valve implantation."
2008,18633204,Analysis of trace residues of tetracyclines in dark-colored honeys by high-performance liquid chromatography using polymeric cartridge and metal chelate affinity chromatography.,"An efficient clean-up procedure was developed for the trace residue determination of tetracyclines (TCs) in dark-colored honeys. TCs were extracted from samples with McIlvaine buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.01 mol/L Na(2)EDTA. The extracts were treated with both a polymeric cartridge (GL-Pak PLS-2) and a metal chelate affinity column (MCAC) preloaded with copper(II). TCs were eluted and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using fluorescence detection. The method was evaluated for the determination of oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), and chlortetracycline (CTC) in buckwheat honey, because its color is the darkest. The mean recoveries of OTC, TC and CTC from spiked samples, at three fortification levels, were >70%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <10%. Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of OTC, TC, and CTC were estimated to be 0.015 mg/kg, 0.019 mg/kg, and 0.024 mg/kg, respectively."
2013,24156366,Protective activity of Panduratin A against thioacetamide-induced oxidative damage: demonstration with in vitro experiments using WRL-68 liver cell line.,"Chalcone Panduratin A (PA) has been known for its antioxidant property, but its merits against oxidative damage in liver cells has yet to be investigated. Hence, the paper aimed at accomplishing this task with normal embryonic cell line WRL-68.PA was isolated from Boesenbergia rotunda rhizomes and its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and ferric reducing power (FRAP) activities were measured in comparison with that of the standard reference drug Silymarin (SI). Oxidative damage was induced by treating the cells with 0.04 g/ml of toxic thioacetamide for 60 minutes followed by treatment with 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml concentrations of either PA or SI. The severities of oxidative stress in the control and experimental groups of cells were measured by Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities.PA exhibited an acceptable DPPH scavenging and FRAP activities close to that of Silymarin. Treating the injured cells with PA significantly reduced the MDA level and increased the cell viability, comparable to SI. The activities of SOD, CAT and GPx were significantly elevated in the PA-treated cells in a dose dependent manner and again similar to SI.Collectively, data suggested that PA has capacity to protect normal liver cells from oxidative damage, most likely via its antioxidant scavenging ability."
2002,12160480,Pharmacokinetic interactions between herbal remedies and medicinal drugs.,"1. The use of herbal products to treat a wide range of conditions is rising rapidly, leading to increased intake of phytochemicals. Recent studies revealed potentially fatal interactions between herbal remedies and traditional drugs. 2. In transplant patients, self-medication with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) has led to a drop in plasma levels of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine, causing tissue rejection. 3. Intake of St John's wort increases the expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein and the expression of CYP3A4 in the liver and intestine. The combined up-regulation in intestinal P-glycoprotein and hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 impairs the absorption and stimulates the metabolism of cyclosporine, leading to subtherapeutic plasma levels. The St John's wort component, hyperforin, contributes to the induction of CYP3A4. 4. St John's wort also enhances the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates including the protease inhibitors indinavir and nevirapine, oral contraceptives, and tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. 5. Other herbal remedies with the potential to modulate cytochrome P450 activity and thus participate in interactions with conventional drugs include Milk thistle, Angelica dahurica, ginseng, garlic preparations, Danshen and liquorice. 6. Herbal products are currently not subject to the rigorous testing indispensable for conventional drugs. However, if potential drug interactions are to be predicted, it is essential that the ability of herbal products to interfere with drug-metabolizing enzyme systems is fully established."
2017,28134230,[Flavonolignans - compounds not only for liver treatment].,"Flavonolignans are the major bioactive components presented in the Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) standarized extract - silymarin. S. marianum is a medicinal plant, which has been using for thousands of years as a remedy for a variety of ailments. Since the 70s of the last century flavonolignans presented in silymarin have been regarded to the official medicine as substances having an hepatoprotective properties. Structurally, flavonolignans are composed of a flavonoid unit (taxifolin) and a phenylpropane unit (coniferyl alcohol), linked together by an oxeran ring. Many studies which have been conducted in recent years demonstrated that flavonolignans posses a various healthy properties. Flavonolignans modulate of a variety cell-signaling pathways as well as inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism, resulting in the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators formation. The researches performed in last year's demonstrated that the major flavonolignan - silybin is able to inhibit two blood coagulation factors: thrombin and FXa. Flavonolignans have been also studied as a potential anticancer agents. This review article presents flavonolignans health benefits effects not only for the liver."
2014,24491714,Determination of melatonin and its isomer in foods by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,"This study aimed to develop a reliable analytical method for the determination of melatonin and its isomers in various food products. The method entails ethanol extraction of solid samples (or dilution of liquid samples) prior to liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadruple mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of target analytes. The method was in-house validated and successfully applied to various food matrices. Recovery of melatonin from different matrices were found to be 86.0 ± 3.6%, 76.9 ± 5.4%, 98.6 ± 6.4%, and 67.0 ± 4.5% for beer, walnut, tomato and sour cherry samples, respectively. No melatonin could be detected in black and green tea, sour cherry, sour cherry concentrate, kefir (a fermented milk drink) and red wine while the highest amount of melatonin (341.7 ± 29.3 pg/g) was detected in crumb. The highest amounts of melatonin isomer were detected in yeast-fermented foods such as 170.7 ± 29.9 ng/ml in red wine, 14.3 ± 0.48 ng/ml in beer, and 15.7 ± 1.4 ng/g in bread crumb."
2019,31199703,"Amount of Progesterone Consumed Based on Varying Fat Concentrations, Dietary Recommendations, and Estimated Safe Levels in Commercial Cow Origin Liquid Dairy Products.","Federal guidelines recommend that food with hormone content fall below 1% of endogenous production in the subset of the population with the lowest daily production. The majority of dairy products are obtained from pregnant cows, which increase the level of hormones present. The purpose of this article was to perform theoretical evaluation of the quantity of progesterone in cow's milk based on fat percentages and to assess whether this was within the recommended range. Daily recommended dairy product intake from various countries worldwide was researched. This was compared to the concentration of progesterone previously identified in varying fat contents of cow origin milk to assess the amount of progesterone (mg/day) that would be consumed if the guidelines were followed. The maximum daily progesterone consumption suggested will be met by ingestion of 2.7 L, 1.42 L, 1.13 L, 940 mL, 810 mL, 650 mL of 0% (skim), 1%, 2%, 3.25%, 10% (cream), and 35% (whipping cream) fat liquid cow origin dairy product, respectively. Therefore, ingestion of the highest amount of recommended daily dairy intake fell below 1% of the daily endogenous quantity produced, except in the unlikely case of consumption of 650 mL of 35% fat. Studies demonstrating an effect of cow's liquid dairy product intake may need to be revisited, since levels of progesterone consumption remain within the recommended levels. However, it should be considered that ingestion of cow's milk might have a potential effect on the hormonal profile in patients; however, this seems unlikely."
2020,29477137,Taiwanofungus camphoratus Combined With Amphotericin B for Metastatic Cancer Patients Unresponsive to or Unwilling to Undergo Chemotherapy: A Pilot Study.,"Taiwanofungus camphoratus is a parasitic mushroom found in the heartwood of Cinnamomum kanehirai and is used as a nutritional supplement. It has an anticancer action, both alone and synergistically with amphotericin B (AmB).The study intended to assess the efficacy of a T camphoratus ethanol extract (TCEE) combined with AmB for patients with metastatic cancer whose cancer did not respond to multiline chemotherapy or who were unwilling to receive chemotherapy.The research team performed a retrospective analysis as a pilot study.The study took place at a single hospital (Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan).Participants were 9 patients at the hospital who were terminally ill with metastatic cancer.The participants had received daily doses of 2-3 g of the TCEE in combination with a weekly dose of 20-25 mg of AmB in 500 cc of 5% glucose water, given intravenously in 4-6 h.Outcome measures included (1) a primary evaluation index measuring the efficacy of the treatment; (2) a measure of tumor burden that was estimated using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), (3) a secondary evaluation index measuring survival duration, and (4) safety.The mean treatment time was 54.4 ± 18.3 wk. At the end of the study, 2 patients showed a continued complete response, 1 patient had a continued partial response, and 1 patient showed a stable disease. The other 5 participants had times to progression ranging from 24 to 48 wk, with a mean of 35.6 wk. The mean survival time was 57.8 ± 18.5 wk, and 5 patients were still alive at the end of the study.For patients whose metastatic cancer did not respond to multiline chemotherapy or who were unwilling to receive chemotherapy, the use of TCEE as an adjuvant therapy to AmB resulted in tumor suppression and a delay in time to disease progression. The preliminary results reported here can be used to guide a future, more extensive clinical study of the combination."
2018,28940159,Zinc Status in Beta Thalassemia Major Patients.,"Beta thalassemia is a common monogenic hereditary hemoglobinopathy which is associated with compound complications. Zinc deficiency, which is commonly observed in thalassemia patients, is also associated with multiple health complications. The objective of this study was to determine the zinc status and its effect on the growth and immune functions of young beta thalassemia major patients. The study included 40 patients in comparison with age- and sex-matched 30 healthy individuals as controls. The patients were interviewed for socio-demographic variables, and their medical histories were obtained from the hospital files. Serum concentrations of zinc and ferritin, height, and body mass indices (BMI) were calculated. Mean serum zinc level in beta thalassemia major patients was 44.7 ± 24.2 μg/dl whereas in the control group it was 63.3 ± 30.3μg/dl. The mean serum zinc level is significantly low in beta thalassemia major patients with respect to the control group. The gender, age, duration of blood transfusion, blood transfusion volume, mean pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration, deferasirox dose, and serum ferritin level bear no relationship with serum zinc level of the beta thalassemia major patients. Zinc level showed no significant correlation with z-scores of stature, sitting height index, BMI, and frequency of recent infections of patients. Although zinc deficiency is common in beta thalassemia major patients, it was found to have no significant effect on physical growth and frequency of infections. Further studies are recommended to investigate zinc status of beta thalassemia major patients."
2007,18043481,Excretion of ketoprofen and nalbuphine in human milk during treatment of maternal pain after delivery.,"Analgesics are required to prevent and treat postpartum pain, but breast-feeding may be contraindicated, because data on milk transfer are very limited. The present study was undertaken to quantify the transfer of ketoprofen and nalbuphine in milk. Eighteen patients gave their informed consent to participate and completed the study. Following delivery, they received ketoprofen (100 mg/12 hours) and nalbuphine (0.2 mg/kg/4 hours) as an intravenous bolus over 2 to 3 days for postpartum pain. Milk samples were collected during the 12 hours between the third and fourth ketoprofen administrations. Ketoprofen and nalbuphine concentrations were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean and maximum ketoprofen milk concentrations were 57+/-37 and 91+/-51 ng/mL, respectively. Assuming a milk volume of 150 mL/kg/day, the mean and maximum doses that a breast-fed neonate would ingest during one day are 8.5+/-5.5 and 13.6+/-7.6 microg/kg/day, respectively, and the relative infant dose is 0.31+/-0.17% of the weight-adjusted maternal daily dose. The mean and maximum nalbuphine milk concentrations were 42+/-26 and 61+/-26 ng/mL, respectively. Assuming a milk volume of 150 mL/kg/day, the mean and maximum doses that a breast-fed neonate would ingest during one day is 7.0+/-3.2 and 9.0+/-3.8 microg/kg/day, and the relative infant dose is 0.59+/-0.27% of the weight-adjusted maternal daily dose. Therefore, breast-feeding is permissible when ketoprofen and/or nalbuphine are administered to the mother to treat postpartum pain."
2016,27938355,Metalloproteinases and their inhibitors are influenced by inhalative glucocorticoid therapy in combination with environmental dust reduction in equine recurrent airway obstruction.,"Overexpression of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been shown to lead to tissue damage in equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), as a misbalance with their natural inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), occurs. This favors irreversible pulmonary fibrosis formation. Increased levels of MMPs, TIMPs or altered ratios between them can be used as biomarkers of respiratory disease. We hypothesized that levels of MMPs, TIMPs and their ratios correlate with improvement in clinical findings and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology after 10 days of inhalative glucocorticoid therapy and environmental dust reduction (EDR) and may be used to monitor treatment success. Ten horses with a history of RAO participated in a prospective clinical study. Clinical and cytological scoring was performed before and after inhalative therapy using budesonide (1500 μg BID over 10 days) and EDR (bedding of wood shavings and wet hay as roughage). Gelatin zymography was performed for qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in BALF supernatant, while fluorimetry was used to evaluate MMP-8 activity. Additionally, specific equine ELISA assays were used for quantitative assessment of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.A significant reduction in the total and several single parameters of the clinical score were found after 10 days of inhalative therapy and EDR. The concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (ELISA) as well as their activities (MMP-2 and MMP-9 zymography and MMP-8 fluorimetry) were significantly decreased after therapy. Significant improvements in MMP-8/TIMP-1 and MMP-8/TIMP-2 ratios were also found, differences between other ratios before and after therapy were insignificant.Metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, in particular MMP-9 and TIMP-2, are valuable markers for clinical improvement in RAO."
2001,11705450,Effects of purified green and black tea polyphenols on cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-dependent metabolism of arachidonic acid in human colon mucosa and colon tumor tissues.,"The effects of green and black tea polyphenols on cyclooxygenase (COX)- and lipoxygenase (LOX)-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism in normal human colon mucosa and colon cancers were investigated. At a concentration of 30 microg/mL, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) from green tea and theaflavins from black tea inhibited LOX-dependent activity by 30-75%. The formation of 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX metabolites was inhibited to a similar extent. Tea polyphenols also inhibited COX-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism in microsomes from normal colon mucosa, with ECG showing the strongest inhibition. The formation of thromboxane (TBX) and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) was decreased to a greater extent than other metabolites. The inhibitory effects of tea polyphenols on COX activity, however, were less pronounced in tumor microsomes than in normal colon mucosal microsomes. Theaflavins strongly inhibited the formation of TBX and HHT, but increased the production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in tumor microsomes. The enhancing effect of theaflavins on PGE(2) production was related to the COX-2 level in the microsomes. Although theaflavin inhibited ovine COX-2, its activity in the formation of PGE(2) was stimulated by theaflavin when ovine COX-2 was mixed with microsomes, suggesting that theaflavin affects the interaction of COX-2 with other microsomal factors (e.g. PGE synthase). The present results indicate that tea polyphenols can affect arachidonic acid metabolism in human colon mucosa and colon tumors, and this action may alter the risk for colon cancer in humans."
,2133094,S-oxygenation of thiobencarb (Bolero) in hepatic preparations from striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and mammalian systems.,"The in vitro S-oxygenation of thiobencarb (Bolero; p-chlorobenzyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate) in the presence of hepatic microsomes from freshwater- and seawater-adapted striped bass was investigated. Thiobencarb S-oxide was the principal metabolite and accounted for 98% of the total thiobencarb metabolized by striped bass liver microsomes. Studies on the biochemical mechanisms for striped bass hepatic S-oxygenation suggest that this reaction is catalyzed largely by the flavin-containing monooxygenase and to a lesser extent by cytochromes P-450. Following the short incubation period used, no thiobencarb sulfone was detected and no evidence was found for a contribution of cooxidation in the S-oxidation of thiobencarb. This conclusion was supported by studies with microsomes and purified mammalian monooxygenases which also metabolized thiobencarb without cooxidizing factors. Highly purified cytochrome P-450IIB-1 S-oxygenated thiobencarb more efficiently than highly purified hog liver flavin-containing monoxygenase. Thiobencarb S-oxide and thiobencarb sulfone were efficient carbamylating agents and reacted with thiol and amine nucleophiles, whereas thiobencarb itself was relatively stable to transthiocarbamylation. Monooxygenase-catalyzed S-oxygenation of thiobencarb by striped bass liver microsomes may represent a bioactivation process which could explain the known toxicity of thiobencarb in fish."
2012,22177694,Altered plasma concentrations of sex hormones in cats infected by feline immunodeficiency virus or feline leukemia virus.,"Gender differences may affect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans and may be related to fluctuations in sex hormone concentration. The different percentage of male and female cats observed to be infected by feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been traditionally explained through the transmission mechanisms of both viruses. However, sexual hormones may also play a role in this different distribution. To study this possibility, 17β-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations were analyzed using a competitive enzyme immunoassay in the plasma of 258 cats naturally infected by FIV (FIV(+)), FeLV (FeLV(+)), or FeLV and FIV (F(-)F(+)) or negative for both viruses, including both sick and clinically healthy animals. Results indicated that the concentrations of 17β-estradiol and testosterone were significantly higher in animals infected with FIV or FeLV (P < 0.05) than in negative cats. Plasma concentrations of DHEA in cats infected by either retrovirus were lower than in negative animals (P < 0.05), and F(-)F(+) cats had significantly lower plasma values than monoinfected cats (P < 0.05). No significant differences were detected in the plasma concentration of progesterone of the four groups. No relevant differences were detected in the hormone concentrations between animal genders, except that FIV(+) females had higher DHEA concentrations than the corresponding males (P < 0.05). In addition, no differences were observed in the hormone concentrations between retrovirus-infected and noninfected animals with and without clinical signs. These results suggest that FIV and FeLV infections are associated with an important deregulation of steroids, possibly from early in the infection process, which might have decisive consequences for disease progression."
2014,25387896,Vitamin C treatment attenuates hemorrhagic shock related multi-organ injuries through the induction of heme oxygenase-1.,"Vitamin C (VitC) has recently been shown to exert beneficial effects, including protecting organ function and inhibiting inflammation, in various critical care conditions, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a heat shock protein, has been shown to prevent organ injuries in hemorrhagic shock (HS) but the relationship between VitC and HO-1 are still ill-defined so far. Here we conducted a systemic in vivo study to investigate if VitC promoted HO-1 expression in multiple organs, and then tested if the HO-1 induction property of VitC was related to its organ protection and anti-inflammatory effect.Firstly, to determine the HO-1 induction property of VitC, the HO-1 level were measured in tissues including kidney, liver and lung of the normal and HS model of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats after VitC treatment (100 mg/kg body weight). Secondly, to testify if VitC prevented HS related organ injuries via inducing HO-1, the HS model of rats were separately pre- and post-treated with VitC, and some of them also received Zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp), a specific HO-1 inhibitor. The HO-1 activity in tissues was tested; the organ injuries (as judged by histological changes in tissues and the biochemical indicators level in serum) and inflammatory response in tissues (as judged by the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines Tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-6 ) were analyzed.The HO-1 mRNA and protein level in kidney, liver, and lung were highly induced by VitC treatement under normal and HS conditions. The HO-1 activity in tissues was enhanced by both VitC pre- and post-treatment, which was shown to improve the organ injuries and inhibit the inflammatory response in the HS model of rats. Of note, the beneficial effects of VitC were abolished after HO-1 activity was blocked by Znpp.VitC led to a profound induction of HO-1 in multiple organs including the kidney, liver and lung, and this property might be responsible for the organ protection and inflammation inhibitory effects of both pre- and post-treatment with VitC in HS."
2011,21570765,"Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), derived from a honeybee product propolis, exhibits a diversity of anti-tumor effects in pre-clinical models of human breast cancer.","Breast cancer (BC) patients use alternative and natural remedies more than patients with other malignancies. Specifically, 63-83% use at least one type of alternative medicine and 25-63% use herbals and vitamins. Propolis is a naturopathic honeybee product, and CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester), is a major medicinal component of propolis. CAPE, in a concentration dependent fashion, inhibits MCF-7 (hormone receptor positive, HR+) and MDA-231 (a model of triple negative BC (TNBC) tumor growth, both in vitro and in vivo without much effect on normal mammary cells and strongly influences gene and protein expression. It induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and reduces expression of growth and transcription factors, including NF-κB. Notably, CAPE down-regulates mdr-1 gene, considered responsible for the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Further, CAPE dose-dependently suppresses VEGF formation by MDA-231 cells and formation of capillary-like tubes by endothelial cells, implicating inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that CAPE inhibits MDA-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer growth via its apoptotic effects, and modulation of NF-κB, the cell cycle, and angiogenesis."
2006,16651732,Preventive effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBB) on the lipopolysaccharide-induced expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 via suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB in RAW 264.7 cells.,"During our ongoing efforts to identify bioactive natural products with anti-inflammatory activity, we produced an extract from Ginkgo biloba (GBB) which contains higher levels of the active principles terpene and biflavonoid than EGb, the standard commercially available extract. In the present study, we examined and compared the effects of these two extracts on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. Our data indicate that GBB is a more potent inhibitor of NO and PGE2 production than EGb 761, and it also significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha release. Consistent with these observations, the protein and mRNA expression levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were found to be inhibited by GBB in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GBB inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which was associated with the prevention of IkappaB degradation, and subsequently with decreased p65 protein level in the nucleus. These results suggest that GBB inhibits LPS-induced iNOS, COX-2 and TNF-alpha expressions through the down-regulation of NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity."
2014,24704558,Cordycepin induces apoptosis of C6 glioma cells through the adenosine 2A receptor-p53-caspase-7-PARP pathway.,"Cordycepin, 3'-deoxyadenosine from Cordyceps sinensis, has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects in several cancer cell lines. This study investigated the effect of cordycepin on a rat glioma cell line. Cordycepin caused apoptosis in C6 glioma cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, but did not affect the survival of primary cultured rat astrocytes. Cordycepin increased the total protein levels of p53 and phosphorylated p53 in the C6 cells. Levels of cleaved caspase-7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), but not cleaved caspase-3, were also increased after cordycepin treatment. Specific inhibitors for p53 and caspases abrogated cordycepin-induced caspase-7 and PARP cleavage, and prevented cordycepin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of p53 blocked cordycepin-induced cleavage of caspase-7 and PARP. Both adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist and small interference RNA (siRNA) knockdown of A2AR blocked cordycepin-induced apoptosis, p53 activation, and caspase-7 and PARP cleavage. These may provide a new strategy of cordycepin for glioma therapy in the future. "

The compounds are insoluble in water but quantitatively extracted into chloroform. These properties have been exploited for the determination of phenothiazines in pure solutions and pharmaceuticals."
1994,8024464,Milk transfer and tissue uptake of mercury in suckling offspring after exposure of lactating maternal guinea pigs to inorganic or methylmercury.,"Maternal guinea pigs were injected with mercuric chloride (HgCl2; 1 mg Hg/kg body weight) or methylmercury (MeHg; 1 mg Hg/kg) 12 h after parturition, and exposure of the offspring to mercury (Hg) via breast milk were studied on days 3, 5 and 10 postpartum. Milk Hg concentrations were lower than maternal plasma Hg concentrations regardless of the form of Hg given to the dams. Milk Hg was higher in HgCl2-treated dams than in MeHg-treated dams. In MeHg-treated dams, MeHg was separately determined. While the ratio of MeHg to T-Hg decreased in the dams' plasma, it did not in the milk. There was a strong correlation between milk and plasma T-Hg concentrations in HgCl2 treated dams. In the milk of MeHg-treated dams, the plasma MeHg concentrations correlated better than did the plasma T-Hg concentrations. In the offspring, regardless of the chemical forms of Hg given to the dams, the highest Hg concentrations were found in the kidney, followed by the liver and the brain. Brain Hg concentrations were, however, significantly higher in the offspring of MeHg-treated dams than in those of HgCl2-treated dams. In addition, Hg levels in the major organs of the offspring of HgCl2-treated dams peaked on day 5 postpartum, while those of MeHg-treated dams did not show a significant decrease up to day 10 postpartum. These facts indicate that the two chemical forms of Hg were transferred to the offspring via the breast milk and were distributed differently, depending on the chemical form, to the offspring's tissues."
2013,23993559,Influence of human gastric juice on oxidation of marine lipids--in vitro study.,"This study evaluates whether marine lipids can oxidise in acidic stomach environment and whether authentic gastric juice has the potential to act as a pro- or anti-oxidative medium. Oxidation of herring lipids in emulsions and liposomes was followed in in vitro digestion models containing authentic human gastric juice, and compared to models containing hydrochloric acid solution. Peroxide value, concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and oxygen uptake rate increased in all the models during 2.5 h incubation at pH 4 and 37 °C in darkness. The markers showed no difference between oxidation in gastric juice and hydrochloric acid solution. Gastric juice reduced the prooxidant activity of iron ions measured as oxygen uptake rate, but did not reduce the activity of methemoglobin. Berry juice, green tea, red wine, and caffeic acid reduced oxygen uptake in the acidic environments while coffee, ascorbic acid and orange juice increased oxidation. Beverages accompanying foods containing marine lipids will therefore affect the course of post-prandial lipid oxidation."
2011,20582416,Combinatorial effects of thymoquinone on the anti-cancer activity of doxorubicin.,"Doxorubicin is a mainstay of cancer chemotherapy despite its clinical limitations that arise from its cardiotoxicity and the high incidence of multi-drug resistance. Recent studies revealed a protective effect of thymoquinone, a non-toxic constituent of the essential oil of Nigella sativa, against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We now investigated the influence of thymoquinone on various other effects exerted by doxorubicin in human cancer cells.Doxorubicin, thymoquinone and equimolar mixtures of both were tested for cytotoxicity on human cells of HL-60 leukaemia, 518A2 melanoma, HT-29 colon, KB-V1 cervix, and MCF-7 breast carcinomas as well as multi-drug-resistant variants thereof and on non-malignant human fibroblasts (HF). Apoptosis induction was analysed via DNA fragmentation, activity studies of the caspases-3, -8 and -9, determination of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and in the ratio of the mRNA expressions of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins bax and bcl-2. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by the NBT assay.Thymoquinone improved the anti-cancer properties of doxorubicin in a cell line-specific manner. We found a significant rise of the growth inhibition by doxorubicin in HL-60 and multi-drug-resistant MCF-7/TOPO cells when thymoquinone had been added. The mode of action of both drugs and of their mixture was mainly apoptotic. In HL-60 cells, the drug mixture caused an additional concentration maximum of effector caspase-3 not observed for either of the pure drugs. The impact of the drug mixture on the mitochondria of HL-60 cells was also greater than those of the individual quinones alone. In addition, the drug mixture led to a higher concentration of reactive oxygen species in HL-60 cells.In summary, thymoquinone is a booster for the anti-cancer effect of doxorubicin in certain cancer cell lines. Distinct improvements on efficacy, selectivity, and even breaches of multi-drug resistance were observed for equimolar mixtures of doxorubicin and thymoquinone."
2013,23838966,Ameliorative effect of Noni fruit extract on streptozotocin-induced memory impairment in mice.,"This study evaluated the effects of a standardized ethyl acetate extract of Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) fruit on impairment of memory, brain energy metabolism, and cholinergic function in intracerebral streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice. STZ (0.5 mg/kg) was administered twice at an interval of 48 h. Noni (50 and 100 mg/kg, postoperatively) was administered for 21 days following STZ administration. Memory function was evaluated using Morris Water Maze and passive avoidance tests, and brain levels of cholinergic function, oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were estimated. STZ caused memory impairment in Morris Water Maze and passive avoidance tests along with reduced brain levels of ATP, BDNF, and acetylcholine and increased acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress. Treatment with Noni extract (100 mg/kg) prevented the STZ-induced memory impairment in both behavioral tests along with reduced oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity, and increased brain levels of BDNF, acetylcholine, and ATP level. The study shows the beneficial effects of Noni fruit against STZ-induced memory impairment, which may be attributed to improved brain energy metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, BDNF, and antioxidative action.

2007,17448122,Ferric-reducing ability power of selected plant polyphenols and their metabolites: implications for clinical studies on the antioxidant effects of fruits and vegetable consumption.,"Undeniably, low sensitivities in the ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP) is evident in the detection of the augmentation of plasma antioxidant activity, relative to the rise in circulating polyphenols after ingestion of fruits and vegetables. We investigated in vitro the FRAP of 17 plant polyphenols and their metabolites at submicromolar concentrations commensurate in human plasma. We then explored the in vitro effects of polyphenols and purified apple quercetin glycosides on plasma FRAP. We found that apple quercetin glycosides along with various polyphenols observed this distinct power at submicromolar concentrations. The presence of a catechol structure in the compound molecule was positively associated with FRAP (r = 0.60, P < 0.05). An aliphatic substitute at a catechol ring and a double bond in an aliphatic substitute conjugated with an aromatic ring of catechol contributed to 37% of the variance in the FRAP of compounds with catechol in the backbone structure (n = 11). Plasma supplementation with 0.2 microM mixtures of seven of the most active compounds (catechin, 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and quercetin) initiated a placid rise in FRAP (23.3 +/- 1.2 versus 28.1 +/- 1.3 nmol of Fe(3+), P < 0.05). Apple quercetin glycosides at 0.5 microM did not elevate plasma FRAP. Plasma alone had 30 times higher power than quercetin glycosides at 0.5 microM. Abounding of FRAP exhibited in human plasma as compared to polyphenols at submicromolar concentrations, may offer elucidation to previous incongruities implicated in insignificant rises of plasma FRAP several days after ingestion of fruits or vegetables. This suggests that intake of food products and/or supplements rich in polyphenols containing a catechol ring with an aliphatic substitute augments the plasma FRAP in human beings."
2013,24393115,[Alkalimetric titrations of salts of organic bases in the Pharmacopoeia].,"Modified methods - alkalimetry in ethanol 70% with a defined small volume of hydrochloric acid 0.01 mol/l added to the solution of the sample before the titration and alkalimetry in ethanol 70% or ethanol 96% alone with potentiometric end-point detection for the assay of halide salts of 11 organic N-bases has been investigated. The results were compared to those obtained by the method of the European Pharmacopoeia 7th Ed. (Ph. Eur. 7th Ed.). The Ph. Eur. 7th Ed. use for 8 investigated substances alkalimetry in alcohol 96 % with a defined small volume of hydrochloric acid 0.01 mol/l (5 ml) with potentiometric end-point detection: Cinchocaine hydrochloride, Codeine hydrochloride dihydrate, Ethylmorphine hydrochloride, Lidocaine hydrochloride, Papaverine hydrochloride, Pilocarpine hydrochloride, Quinine hydrochloride, Tetracaine hydrochloride. Our results revealed that the Ph. Eur. 7th Ed. method did not work for 5 drugs from this group: Cinchocaine hydrochloride, Ethylmorphine hydrochloride, Papaverine hydrochloride, Pilocarpine hydrochloride and Tetracaine hydrochloride. In the group of investigated substances we included also drugs with the character of weak organic bases for which Ph. Eur. 7th Ed. prescribed different methods for their assay: Thiamine hydrochloride and Pyridoxine hydrochloride - acidimetric titration in non-aqueous solvents with perchloric acid and Procaine hydrochloride - determination of primary aromatic amino-nitrogen (Ph. Eur. 7th Ed., chapter 2.5.8)."
2017,28619387,Evaluation of ameliorative ability of Silibinin against zidovudine and isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity and hyperlipidaemia in rats: Role of Silibinin in Phase I and II drug metabolism.,"HIV/AIDS patients have suppressed immune system, making them vulnerable to many opportunistic infections including tuberculosis (TB). The patients who are co-infected with TB undergo combined regimens with anti-retroviral drugs such as zidovudine (AZT) and anti-tubercular drug such as isoniazid (INH) for therapy leading to hepatotoxicty. Silibinin (SBN), extracted from Silybum marianum commonly called as ""Milk thistle"" is used against several drugs-induced hepatotoxicity. The present study evaluates the ameliorative effect of SBN against AZT alone, INH alone, and INH + AZT-induced toxic insults to liver of rats. Wistar albino rats (n = 6/groups) were given INH and AZT (25 and 50 mg mg/kg b.w.) respectively either alone or in combination for a sub-chronic period of 45 days orally. Another group of rats received SBN (100 mg/kg b.w.) along with INH and AZT. The group that received propylene glycol served as control. AZT alone, INH alone and INH + AZT treatments showed parenchymal cell injury and cholestasis by highly significant increase in the activities of marker enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, argino succinic acid lyase), bilirubin and protein. The presence of hyperlipidaemia was observed by analyzing lipid profiles in serum/liver/adipose tissue, gene expression (RT-PCR) of Phase-I and II metabolizing enzymes and western blot. Transmission electron microscopy study also revealed large vacuoles with membraneous debri, pleomorphic mitochondria, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum, presence of lipid droplets, breakage in cellular and nuclear membrane. SBN simultaneous treatment showed ameliorative effect against INH + AZT-induced hepatotoxicity and hyperlipidemia in rats."
2012,22980867,Simultaneous determination of riboflavin and pyridoxine by UHPLC/LC-MS in UK commercial infant meal food products.,"An assay for the simultaneous quantitative determination of riboflavin and pyridoxine in eight different complementary infant meal products has been developed in order to (1) estimate the daily intake of these vitamins from commercial infant food consumption, and (2) ascertain their nutritional suitability relative to dietary guidelines for the 6-9 months age group. The method involves mild hydrolysis of the foods, an extraction of the supernatant by centrifugation followed by quantitative determination using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Separation of the two water soluble vitamins is achieved within one minute and the resultant sample is also LC-MS compatible. Despite wide individual differences between brands (p=6.5e-12), no significant differences were observed in the level of pyridoxine between the meat and vegetable-based varieties (p=0.7) per 100g of commercial infant food. Riboflavin was not detected in any of the samples where the detection limit was below 0.07 μg/mL. In terms of the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) of pyridoxine for 6-9 months old infants, the complementary infant meal products analysed herein provided less than 15% of the RNI values with mean (SD) values of 12.87 (± 4.46)% and 13.88 (± 4.97)% for the meat- and vegetable-based recipes, respectively. The estimated total daily intake of riboflavin and pyridoxine from the consumption of commercial complementary food was found to be satisfactory and in accordance with the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs). The intake of both riboflavin and pyridoxine was estimated to be mainly derived from the consumption of formula milk which could be a cause of concern if the quality of an infant's milk diet is compromised by an inadequate or lack of supplemented milk intake. The results of this study suggest that the selected commercial complementary infant foods in the UK market may not contain the minimum levels of riboflavin and pyridoxine required for the labelling declaration of the micronutrient content of such products as recommended by Commission Directive 2006/125/EC."
,15517885,Role of resveratrol in prevention and therapy of cancer: preclinical and clinical studies.,"Resveratrol, trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene, was first isolated in 1940 as a constituent of the roots of white hellebore (Veratrum grandiflorum O. Loes), but has since been found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. Besides cardioprotective effects, resveratrol exhibits anticancer properties, as suggested by its ability to suppress proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, including lymphoid and myeloid cancers; multiple myeloma; cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, and thyroid; melanoma; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; ovarian carcinoma; and cervical carcinoma. The growth-inhibitory effects of resveratrol are mediated through cell-cycle arrest; upregulation of p21Cip1/WAF1, p53 and Bax; down-regulation of survivin, cyclin D1, cyclin E, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and clAPs; and activation of caspases. Resveratrol has been shown to suppress the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, AP-1 and Egr-1; to inhibit protein kinases including IkappaBalpha kinase, JNK, MAPK, Akt, PKC, PKD and casein kinase II; and to down-regulate products of genes such as COX-2, 5-LOX, VEGF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, AR and PSA. These activities account for the suppression of angiogenesis by this stilbene. Resveratrol also has been shown to potentiate the apoptotic effects of cytokines (e.g., TRAIL), chemotherapeutic agents and gamma-radiation. Phamacokinetic studies revealed that the target organs of resveratrol are liver and kidney, where it is concentrated after absorption and is mainly converted to a sulfated form and a glucuronide conjugate. In vivo, resveratrol blocks the multistep process of carcinogenesis at various stages: it blocks carcinogen activation by inhibiting aryl hydrocarbon-induced CYP1A1 expression and activity, and suppresses tumor initiation, promotion and progression. Besides chemopreventive effects, resveratrol appears to exhibit therapeutic effects against cancer. Limited data in humans have revealed that resveratrol is pharmacologically quite safe. Currently, structural analogues of resveratrol with improved bioavailability are being pursued as potential therapeutic agents for cancer."
2011,20557917,"Comparison of the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin or progesterone on pregnancy per artificial insemination in repeat-breeder dairy cows.","Three different treatments were compared to improve pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI) in repeat-breeder (RB) dairy cows. All cows (n=103) were assigned to one of four groups: (1) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH); (2) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); (3) once-used controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device; and (4) control. All treatments performed 5-6days after artificial insemination (AI) and milk samples were collected just before treatment for progesterone assays. There were no significant differences in milk fat progesterone concentration among trial groups. Cows were observed for estrus signs thrice daily. Pregnancy per AI on day 45 in hCG and CIDR groups were significantly higher than GnRH and control groups (60.0% and 56.0% vs. 26.9% and 29.6%, respectively), but there were no differences in P/AI between GnRH and control groups. There were also no significant differences between hCG and CIDR groups. Milk fat progesterone concentrations were compared between pregnant and non-pregnant cows in each group and only in the hCG group it was significantly lower in pregnant cows. In conclusion, treating repeat-breeder cows with hCG or once-used CIDR 5-6days after AI improved P/AI."
2017,29149023,"Antibiotic Susceptibility, Genetic Diversity, and the Presence of Toxin Producing Genes in Campylobacter Isolates from Poultry.","This study examined antibiotic susceptibility, genetic diversity, and characteristics of virulence genes in Campylobacter isolates from poultry. Chicken (n = 152) and duck (n = 154) samples were collected from 18 wet markets in Korea. Campylobacter spp. isolated from the carcasses were identified by PCR. The isolated colonies were analyzed for antibiotic susceptibility to chloramphenicol, amikacin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin. The isolates were also used to analyze genetic diversity using the DiversiLabTM system and were tested for the presence of cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) genes. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 45 poultry samples out of 306 poultry samples (14.7%) and the average levels of Campylobacter contamination were 22.0 CFU/g and 366.1 CFU/g in chicken and duck samples, respectively. Moreover, more than 90% of the isolates showed resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Genetic correlation analysis showed greater than 95% similarity between 84.4% of the isolates, and three cdt genes (cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC) were present in 71.1% of Campylobacter isolates. These results indicate that Campylobacter contamination should be decreased to prevent and treat Campylobacter foodborne illness."
1993,7678518,Expression and function of a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility on normal and malignant B lymphocytes.,"Migration through extracellular matrix is fundamental to malignant invasion. A receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) has previously been shown to play a fundamental role in locomotion of ras-transformed cells as well as functioning in signal transduction. Expression of RHAMM was characterized on B lymphocytes from normal and malignant lymphoid tissues using multiparameter phenotypic immunofluorescence analysis as well as functional analysis of its role in locomotion of malignant hairy cell leukemia B cells. RHAMM is not detectable on most normal B cells located in blood, spleen, or lymph node, but it is detectable on bone marrow and thymic B cells. Among B-cell malignancies, it is expressed on most terminally differentiated B cells from multiple myeloma bone marrows, is present on a subset of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and is absent on B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Activation of peripheral blood B cells by Staphylococcus A cowan (SAC), but not by pokeweed mitogen, induced transient expression of RHAMM at day 3 of culture, suggesting RHAMM may be used by antigen-activated normal B cells. For malignant cells, expression of RHAMM increased on long-term culture of bone marrow plasma cells from multiple myeloma patients, indicating prolonged expression in contrast to the transient expression on SAC-activated normal B cells. Intriguingly, RHAMM was expressed on hairy leukemia cells located in spleen but absent from those in peripheral blood of the same patient. RHAMM, as expressed on splenic hairy cells, was a 58-Kd molecule that binds hyaluronan, is encoded by a 5.2-kb messenger RNA, and participates in locomotion by these cells. Hairy cells locomoted in response to hyaluronan at 4 mu per minute. Monoclonal antibody to RHAMM inhibited this locomotion almost completely as detected using video time-lapse cinemicrography. These observations are consistent with a role for RHAMM in malignant invasion and metastatic growth."
2013,23197374,Selenium (Se) seed priming induced growth and biochemical changes in wheat under water deficit conditions.,"Insufficient stand establishment at early growth stages in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) due to drought stress is a major problem that limits overall efficiency and yield of crop. Priming of seed is an effective method for raising seed performance and improving tolerance of crops to abiotic stresses especially drought. The seeds of two local wheat cultivars (Kohistan-97 and Pasban-90) were soaked in distilled water or sodium selenate solutions of 25, 50, 75, and 100 μM for 1/2 or 1 h at 25 °C and later re-dried to their original moisture levels before sowing. One-hour priming significantly increased root length stress tolerance index, dry matter stress tolerance index, and total biomass of seedlings; however, no significant effect of changing duration of Se seed priming was observed on plant height stress tolerance index and shoot/root ratio. Among cultivars, Kohistan-97 was found to be more responsive to Se seed treatment as 1 h priming at 100 μM significantly increased its total biomass by 43 % as compared to control treatment. Although biomass of seedlings was not affected with Se seed priming under normal conditions, but it increased significantly with increase in rates of Se under drought stress conditions. One-hour priming at 75 μM increased the total sugar content and total free amino acids in both wheat cultivars. A more significant decrease in soluble proteins of seedlings was observed by 1 h priming than 1/2 h priming under drought stress conditions."
1998,9637649,The effects of extracellular pH with and without bicarbonate on intracellular procaine concentrations and anesthetic effects in crayfish giant axons.,"The potentiating effect of sodium bicarbonate on local anesthetic action is attributed to two mechanisms: (1) an increase in the un-ionized local anesthetic due to extracellular alkalinization, and (2) an accelerated conversion of local anesthetic from un-ionized to ionized form with intracellular acidification caused by bicarbonate. To evaluate these hypotheses, the intracellular pH, intracellular ionized procaine concentration, and evoked action potentials were measured in crayfish giant axons.In all measurements, axon preparations from crayfish were perfused extracellularly for 15 min with either bicarbonate-containing solution at pH 7.6 (bicarb/7.6) or bicarbonate-free solution at pH 7.6 (nonbicarb/7.6) or pH 8.0 (nonbicarb/8.0). Intracellular pH was measured using a pH-sensitive microelectrode. Intracellular anesthetic concentration was measured using a specially designed procaine-sensitive microelectrode with each of three solutions containing 1 mM procaine hydrochloride. Membrane potential was measured and, as an index of anesthetic action, the dV/dt of evoked action potential was calculated during perfusion with procaine.Mean intracellular pH was significantly lower in the bicarb/7.6 (7.16+/-0.07) group than in the nonbicarb/7.6 (7.33+/-0.09) and nonbicarb/8.0 (7.33+/-0.12) groups (P < 0.01). The mean intracellular ionized procaine concentration was significantly higher in the bicarb/7.6 (0.53+/-0.08 mM; P < 0.05) and nonbicarb/8.0 (0.58+/-0.13 mM; P < 0.01) than in nonbicarb/7.6 (0.32+/-0.14 mM) group but did not differ between the bicarb/7.6 and nonbicarb/8.0 groups. The mean percentage decrease in dV/dtmax was approximately coincident with the mean intracellular procaine concentration in each solution.The presence of bicarbonate or extracellular alkalinization increased the intracellular concentration of ionized procaine and the anesthetic effect."
2009,19280157,Effects of drying methods on the physicochemical and compressional characteristics of Okra powder and the release properties of its metronidazole tablet formulation.,"A study has been made of the effects of sun and oven drying methods on the physicochemical characteristics and compressibility of Okra powder and the release properties of its metronidazole tablet formulation. Corn starch was used as the reference standard. The mechanical properties of the tablets were evaluated using crushing strength and friability, while the release properties were determined using the disintegration times and dissolution rates. The results obtained showed that sun-dried Okra powder had smaller particle size, exhibited good flow and possessed higher hydration and swelling capacities compared to the oven dried samples. The compressibility of Okra powders assessed by the indices of plasticity from Heckel (Py) and Kawakita plots (Pk) showed that sun dried Okra powders had higher Py but lower Pk values than the oven-dried Okra powder. Metronidazole tablets formulated with oven dried Okra powder formed stronger tablets than tablets containing sun dried Okra powder. Generally, tablets containing sun dried Okra powders had faster disintegration and dissolution than tablets formulated with oven-dried powder. The results suggest that the choice of drying method during the processing of pharmaceutical raw materials is critical to its physicochemical properties and the release properties of its tablet formulations."
2010,20629655,Gender effects of acute malathion or zinc exposure on the antioxidant response of rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex.,"Gender is one of the most important factors in mammalian development and response to exogenous agents. Although there is increasing evidence that health effects of toxic xenobiotics differ in prevalence or are manifested differently in male and female, the molecular mechanisms related to these events remain unclear. In order to investigate the possible influence of gender, male and female Wistar rats from the same litter were exposed to zinc chloride (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or malathion (250 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 hr prior to the analyses of biochemical parameters related to the cholinergic and glutathione-antioxidant systems in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. After treatments, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was reduced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of male and female rats treated with malathion, but the effect was more pronounced in the male group. Glutathione reductase (GR) and γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase activities were reduced in the hippocampus of males and females and a gender-specific effect of malathion was seen for glutathione S-transferase (GST), which was decreased only in male hippocampus and cortex, and for male cortical GR. Zinc chloride treatment decreased AChE activity in male and female cerebral cortex, with no obvious effect in the hippocampus. Male-specific antioxidant-related enzyme activity reductions were seen after zinc treatment for cortical GR, GST, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; and hippocampal GR. These results clearly demonstrate a greater detrimental effect on antioxidant-related enzyme activities in male hippocampus and cerebral cortex when rats were acutely exposed to malathion and zinc, demonstrating that the research on gender-related differences in health effects caused by xenobiotic and/or essential elements requires further attention."
2013,23069270,Tomato juice consumption reduces systemic inflammation in overweight and obese females.,"Tomatoes are the richest source of lycopene, a potent antioxidant. Tomato products improve antioxidant defences and reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases, at least partly, due to the presence of lycopene. Lycopene, as an anti-inflammatory agent, prevents the production of inflammatory cytokines. Obesity is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the increased level of body fat leads to an increase in circulating inflammatory mediators. We hypothesised that the consumption of a lycopene-rich food would reduce inflammation in people who are overweight or obese. A total of 106 overweight or obese female students of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences were enrolled and randomly allocated to an intervention group (n 53) or a control group (n 53) consuming 330 ml/d of tomato juice or water, respectively, for 20 d. At baseline and day 20, serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNF-α were analysed by ELISA and compared between the groups. Serum concentrations of IL-8 and TNF-α decreased significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group and with baseline. Subgroup analysis indicated that this effect was confined to subjects who were overweight. Among obese subjects, serum IL-6 concentration was decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group, with no differences in IL-8 and TNF-α observed. Tomato juice reduces inflammation in overweight and obese females. Thus, increasing tomato intake may provide a useful approach for reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases such as CVD and diabetes, which are associated with obesity."
2012,21458012,"Cross-sectional study of hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A enzymes in hybrid striped bass, channel catfish and Nile tilapia following oxytetracycline treatment.","Terramycin for Fish® (oxytetracycline, OTC) is one of three approved drugs for therapeutic treatment of fish in the United States. Nothing is known, however, of the effects of this therapeutic on drug metabolizing enzymes in fish post-treatment. The main purpose of the study was to examine whether the fish CYP1A and CYP3A enzymes would cross-react with antibodies to known mammalian cytochrome P-450 forms (CYP1A1 and CYP3A). Observational feeding studies of OTC effects were conducted in hybrid striped bass, channel catfish and Nile tilapia. Oxytetracycline was mixed into the feed to achieve a daily dose of 82.8 mg per kg body weight at a feeding rate of 1% body weight per day. Hepatic microsomes of each fish were prepared and Western blotting of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and enzyme assays of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were performed prior to OTC treatment and on post-treatment days 1, 6, 11 and 21. Both goat anti-rat CYP1A1 and rabbit anti-human CYP3A4 showed good cross-reactivity with all three species in this study. All three species exhibited distinct perturbations in one or more of the variables examined on day 1 post-treatment. Immediately following the 10-day medication period, relative liver weight (RLW) of hybrid striped bass was increased 44% and remained elevated through post-treatment day 21. Increased CYP3A4 enzyme activity and protein abundance were noted in channel catfish and Nile tilapia, respectively. This observational approach demonstrated species differences both in control activities and in the timing and extent of hepatic responses to OTC. The unique perturbations of hepatic CYP450 enzymes in different fish species to OTC treatment observed in this study may have relevance for the use of additional antibiotics or other therapeutics used in aquaculture."
2016,26675856,Influence of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit composition at Glu-B1 locus on secondary and micro structures of gluten in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).,"Glutenin is one of the critical gluten proteins that affect the processing quality of wheat dough. High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) affect rheological behavior of wheat dough. This research demonstrated the effects of four variations of HMW-GS composition at the Glu-B1 locus on secondary and micro structures of gluten and rheological properties of wheat dough, using the bread wheat Xinong 1330 and its three near-isogenic lines (NILs). Results indicated that the Amide I bands of the four wheat lines shifted slightly, but the secondary structure, such as content of α-helices, β-sheets, disulfide bands, tryptophan bands and tyrosine bands, differed significantly among the four NILs. The micro structure of gluten in NIL 2 (Bx14+By15) and NIL 3 (Bx17+By18) showed more cross linkage, with two contrasting patterns. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the content of β-sheets and disulfide bonds has a significant relationship with dough stability, which suggests that the secondary structures could be used as predictors of wheat quality.

2018,29357859,Clinical and genomic safety of treatment with Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extract (IDN 5933/Ginkgoselect®Plus) in elderly: a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial [GiBiEx].,"Numerous health benefits have been attributed to the Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBLE), one of the most extensively used phytopharmaceutical drugs worldwide. Recently, concerns of the safety of the extract have been raised after a report from US National Toxicology Program (NTP) claimed high doses of GBLE increased liver and thyroid cancer incidence in mice and rats. A safety study has been designed to assess, in a population of elderly residents in nursing homes, clinical and genomic risks associated to GBLE treatment.GiBiEx is a multicentre randomized clinical trial, placebo controlled, double blinded, which compared subjects randomized to twice-daily doses of either 120-mg of IDN 5933 (also known as Ginkgoselect®Plus) or to placebo for a 6-months period. IDN 5933 is extracted from dried leaves and contains 24.3% flavone glycosides and 6.1% of terpene lactones (2.9% bilobalide, 1.38% ginkgolide A, 0.66% ginkgolide B, 1.12% ginkgolide C) as determined by HPLC. The study was completed by 47 subjects, 20 in the placebo group and 27 in the treatment group. Clinical (adverse clinical effect and liver injury) and genomic (micronucleus frequency, comet assay, c-myc, p53, and ctnnb1 expression profile in lymphocytes) endpoints were assessed at the start and at the end of the study.No adverse clinical effects or increase of liver injury markers were reported in the treatment group. The frequency of micronuclei [Mean Ratio (MR) = 1.01, 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) 0.86-1.18), and DNA breaks (comet assay) (MR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.58-1.43), did not differ in the two study groups. No significant difference was found in the expression profile of the three genes investigated.None of the markers investigated revealed a higher risk in the treatment group, supporting the safety of IDN 5933 at doses prescribed and for duration of six months.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03004508 , December 20, 2016.

2016,30645821,ruxolitinib (JAKAVI°) and polycythaemia vera Inconclusive evaluation.,"Patients with polycythaemia vera, a myeloproliferative syndrome, are at increased risk of thrombotic events. Marrow fibrosis and transformation to acute leukaemia can also occur after several years. Treatment is based on phlebotomy and aspirin at low (antiplatelet) doses, sometimes combined with hydroxycarbamide, a cytotoxic drug. Various other drugs are available if hydroxycarbamide fails or is poorly tolerated, but there is no consensus treatment. Ruxolitinib inhibits Janus tyrosine kinases, which are involved, among other roles, in haematopoiesis. Ruxolitinib has been authorised in the European Union for patients with polycythaemia vera in whom hydroxycarbamide has failed or is poorly tolerated. Clinical evaluation of ruxolitinib in this setting is based on a randomised, unblinded trial versus treatment chosen by the investigators, in 222 patients treated for 32 weeks. Hydroxycarbamide was chosen in 59% of cases, even though the patients had unacceptable adverse effects or an inadequate response to the drug. The efficacy of the investigators' other treatment choices was uncertain. Phlebotomy was less frequent in the ruxofitinib group than in the control group. The adverse effects of ruxotitinib in this situation are poorly documented, due to inadequate long-term assessment. In the short term, ruxolitinib causes anaemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as bleeding, potentially severe infections, headache, sensory disturbances, and weight gain. It is also likely to share the serious adverse effects of other immunosuppressants. Ruxolitinib is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, creating a risk of multiple drug interactions. Ruxolitinib showed embryofetal toxicity in animal studies. Virtually no data are available in pregnant women. In practice, available data on the harm-benefit balance of ruxolitinib fail to show that this drug represents a tangible advance for patients with polycythaemia vera, as compared with other drugs used when hydroxycarbamide is unsuitable."

Of the 12 patients, 11 failed to respond to M. marinum antigens. All of the patients had, however, normal blastogenic responses to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and the antigens tetanus toxoid and Candida albicans. In contrast, 9 of 14 healthy fishermen responded to the M. marinum antigens with significant in-vitro blastogenesis. Infection of deep tissues with M. marinum is associated with antigen-specific T-cell anergy to M. marinum antigens."
2017,28431534,"The effects of Spirulina Platensis on anthropometric indices, appetite, lipid profile and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in obese individuals: a randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial.","In recent years, a great attention has been focused on Spirulina platensis as a source of potential valuable nutrients for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The objectives of the current study were to determine the effects of Spirulina platensis on anthropometric parameters, serum lipids, appetite and serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in obese individuals.In the current study sixty four obese individuals aged 20-50 years were enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and placebo. Intervention group (n = 29) received each 500 mg of the Spirulina platensis a twice-daily dosage while the control group (n = 27) received two pills daily starch for 12 weeks. Anthropometric parameters and serum VEGF and lipid profile were measured in fasting blood samples at the beginning and end of the study period. Dietary intakes were assessed by a 24-h recall method and appetite was measured using standard visual analogue scale (VAS).Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were decreased in intervention and placebo treated groups although the mean reduction in Spirulina platensis-treated group was significantly higher (P < 0.05). Serum total cholesterol (TC) significantly reduced in intervention group (P < 0.05). Also, treatment with Spirulina platensis significantly reduced appetite (P = 0.008). Mean serum VEGF, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides did not change significantly after intervention. Serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations (HDL-c) significantly increased in both groups while no difference in mean difference of this change has been observed.Spirulina supplementation at a dose of 1 g/d for 12 weeks is effective in modulating body weight and appetite and partly modifies serum lipids. This can further confirm the efficacy of this herbal supplement in control and prevention of obesity and obesity- related disorders.Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT registration number: IRCT2015071219082N7 ; Date registered: September 12, 2015)."
2011,21144104,"Modulatory effects of garlic, ginger, turmeric and their mixture on hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide diabetic rats.","Spices which show hypoglycaemic, hypolipidaemic and antioxidant activities may have a role in the treatment of diabetes and its complications. The present study aimed to compare the modulatory effects of garlic, ginger, turmeric and their mixture on the metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-nicotinamide diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in overnight fasted rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (65 mg/kg body weight) and nicotinamide (110 mg/kg body weight, 15 min before STZ injection). Diabetic rats orally received either distilled water (as vehicle) or 200 mg/kg body weight of garlic bulb, ginger rhizome or turmeric rhizome powder suspension separately or mixed together (GGT mixture) for twenty-eight consecutive days. The results showed that these spices and their mixture significantly alleviated (80-97 %, P < 0·05-0·001) signs of the metabolic syndrome (hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia), the elevation in atherogenic indices and cellular toxicity in STZ-nicotinamide diabetic rats by increasing the production of insulin (26-37 %), enhancing the antioxidant defence system (31-52 %, especially GSH) and decreasing lipid peroxidation (60-97 %). The greatest modulation was seen in diabetic rats that received garlic and the GGT mixture (10-23 % more than that in the ginger and turmeric groups). In conclusion, garlic or the mix including garlic appears to have an impact on each of the measures more effectively than ginger and turmeric and may have a role in alleviating the risks of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications."
2003,12640291,An unusual cause of hypokalemic paralysis: chronic licorice ingestion.,"Long-term licorice ingestion is a well-known cause of secondary hypertension and hypokalemia. Nevertheless, its initial presentation with a very severe degree of hypokalemia and paralysis is exceedingly rare. We report an elderly Asian man who presented to the emergency department with marked muscle weakness that progressed to paralysis. His blood pressure was 160/96 mm Hg. The major biochemical abnormalities were hypokalemia (plasma K+ concentration, 1.8 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis (HCO - 3 , 36 mmol/L). His renal potassium excretion was higher (transtubular potassium gradient of 9). Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were suppressed and cortisol concentration was normal. A detailed history revealed that he had ingested tea flavored with 100 g of natural licorice root containing 2.3% glycyrrhizic acid daily for 3 years. Note that renal potassium wasting and hypertension persisted for 2 weeks after discontinuing licorice consumption along with KCl supplement and spironolactone. Long-term licorice ingestion should be kept in mind as a cause of paralysis with an extreme degree of hypokalemia to avoid missing this recognizable and curable medical disorder."
2016,26597781,Src siRNA prevents corticosteroid-associated osteoporosis in a rabbit model.,"In an established steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) rabbit model we found recently that blockage Src by siRNA could improve reconstructive repair of osteonecrosis via enhancing osteogenesis and inhibiting bone resorption. The current study investigated if blocking Src was able to prevent steroid-associated osteoporosis (SAOP) in the same SAON animal model. Rabbits were treated with pulsed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and corticosteroid methylprednisolone (MPS). At 2, 4, and 6weeks after induction, Src siRNA, control siRNA and saline were intramedullary injected into proximal femur, respectively. Two fluorescent dyes xylenol orange and calcein green were injected before sacrificing the animals for in vivo labeling of the newly formed bone. At week 6 after induction, proximal femora of rabbits were dissected for micro-CT and histological analysis. Results showed significant bone loss in the metaphysis of femoral head in the control rabbits after SAON induction. Src siRNA treatment was able to prevent steroid-associate bone loss in trabecular bone and increase cortical bone thickness at femoral neck. Histomorphometry showed that Src siRNA increased the osteoblastic bone formation and decreased the eroded bone surfaces suggesting decreased osteoclastic bone resorption. This was the first study to report bone loss after SAON induction in rabbit model that could be prevented by knocking down Src by siRNA. "
2014,24882415,"Newly synthesized 'hidabeni' chalcone derivatives potently suppress LPS-induced NO production via inhibition of STAT1, but not NF-κB, JNK, and p38, pathways in microglia.","Chalcones are open-chain flavonoids that are biosynthesized in various plants. Some of them possess anti-inflammatory activity. We previously found that chalcone glycosides from Brassica rapa L. 'hidabeni' suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in rat microglia highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) cells. In this study, to explore chalcone derivatives with potent NO inhibitory activity, we synthesized ten compounds based on 'hidabeni' chalcone and examined their effects on LPS-triggered inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression and NO production. Compounds C4 and C10 potently inhibited NO production (IC50: 4.19, 2.88 µM, respectively). C4 and C10 suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression via the inhibition of the signal transduction and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), but not nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, pathways. C10, but not C4, inhibited activation of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. C4 and C10 also suppressed LPS-induced expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), which is an important transcription factor involved in iNOS expression. Our findings indicate that these chalcone derivatives are candidate compounds for preventing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. "

Gelatin A microspheres were prepared using the emulsification-crosslinking technique. The drug was dispersed in polymer gelatin and formulated into a w/o emulsion with liquid paraffin, using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinking agent. The formulation variables were drug loading and the concentrations of polymer (gelatin), co-polymer (chitosan) and the crosslinking agent. All the prepared microspheres were evaluated for physical characteristics, such as particle size, incorporation efficiency, swelling ability, in vitro bioadhesion on rabbit small intestine and in vitro drug release characteristics in pH 6.6 phosphate buffer. All the microspheres showed good bioadhesive properties. Gelatin A and chitosan concentrations, percentage of the crosslinking agent and also the drug loading affected significantly the rate and extent of drug release. The data indicated that the KT release followed Higuchi's matrix model."
2002,12092815,Evaluation of sulfated Lentinus edodes alpha-(1-->3)-D-glucan as a potential antitumor agent.,Alpha-glucan L-FV-II and beta-glucan L-FV-I were shown to co-exist in the extract of fruiting bodies of Lentinus edodes with aq. 5% NaOH/0.05% NaBH4 in previous work. Water-insoluble alpha-(1-->3)-D-glucan (L-FV-II) was treated with sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex at 25 degrees C to synthesize the water-soluble sulfated derivative SL-FV-II with a degree of substitution (DS) 1.1 in non-selective sulfation. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of sulfated glucan SL-FV-II is 57% of that of the original alpha-glucan L-FV-II. The alpha-glucan administered by gavaging at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight to BALB/C mice having implanted solid Sarcoma 180 was effective at an inhibition rate of 42%. In vitro experiments using human and murine tumor cell lines showed that SL-FV-II had antiproliferation activity at the concentration of 20 microg/mL towards four tumor cell lines. The sulfated alpha-(1-->3)-D-glucan had potent antiproliferation action (52%) on human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells.
2016,27211663,Superheated water extraction of glycyrrhizic acid from licorice root.,"Superheated water extraction (SWE) has become an interesting green extraction method for different classes of compounds. In this study, SWE was used to extract glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from licorice root. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate and optimize the extraction conditions. The influence of operating conditions such as water temperature (100, 120 and 140°C) and solvent flow rates (1, 3 and 5mL/min) were investigated at 0.5mm mean particle size and 20bar pressure. Separation and identification of the glycyrrhizic acid, as the main component, was carried out by the RP-HPLC method. The best operating conditions for the SWE of licorice were determined to be 100°C temperature,15mL/min flow rate and 120min extraction time. The results showed that the amount of the obtained GA was relatively higher using SWE (54.760mg/g) than the Soxhlet method (28.760mg/g) and ultrasonic extraction (18.240mg/g). "

2010,20002065,Regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase expression by Zingiber officinale in the liver of high-fat diet-fed rats.,"Zingiber officinale has been used to control lipid disorders and reported to possess remarkable cholesterol-lowering activity in experimental hyperlipidaemia. In the present study, the effect of a characterized and standardized extract of Zingiber officinale on the hepatic lipid levels as well as on the hepatic mRNA and protein expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was investigated in a high-fat diet-fed rat model. Rats were treated with an ethanol extract of Zingiber officinale (400 mg/kg) extract along with a high-fat diet for 6 weeks. The extract of Zingiber officinale significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride and tended to decrease hepatic cholesterol levels when administered over 6 weeks to the rats fed a high-fat diet. We found that in parallel, the extract up-regulated both LDL receptor mRNA and protein level and down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase protein expression in the liver of these rats. The metabolic control of body lipid homeostasis is in part due to enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and reduced expression of LDL receptor sites following long-term consumption of high-fat diets. The present results show restoration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in low-density lipoprotein and HMG CoA reductase by Zingiber officinale administration with a high-fat diet and provide a rational explanation for the effect of ginger in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia."
2018,30058513,Effect of Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 on inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.,"Beneficial effects of probiotics have been reported on body weight, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, inflammatory state and oxidative stress in healthy subjects and in many metabolic and inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 on inflammatory state and nitro-oxidative stress in patients with and without the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The usual diets of the thirty-three subjects were supplemented with probiotic milk for 90 d. Inflammatory markers and oxidative measurements were performed. In relation to the baseline values, subjects in both groups showed a decrease in homocysteine (P=0·02 and P=0·03, respectively), hydroperoxides (P=0·02 and P=0·01, respectively) and IL-6 levels (P=0·02). Increases in adiponectin (P=0·04) and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx, P=0·001) levels were only seen in the group with the MetS in relation to the baseline values, whereas only the individuals without the MetS had increases in total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter levels (P=0·002). In conclusion, B. lactis HN019 have several beneficial effects on inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers in healthy subjects and the MetS patients. Patients with the MetS showed a specific improvement in adiponectin and NOx levels, whereas a specific favourable effect was shown in the antioxidant defenses in healthy subjects. If the results obtained in the present study are confirmed, supplementation of fermented milk with probiotics in healthy subjects and patients with the MetS must be further discussed."
2017,28131848,"Dehydroandrographolide inhibits oral cancer cell migration and invasion through NF-κB-, AP-1-, and SP-1-modulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibition.","Oral cancer is a type of head and neck cancer that is characterized by cancerous tissue growth in the oral cavity. Andrographolide and dehydroandrographolide (DA) are the two principal components of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees and are the main contributors to its therapeutic properties. However, the pharmacological activities of DA remain unclear.In this study, we used wound closure assay and Boyden chamber assay to determine the effects of DA on oral cancer cell migration and invasion.DA treatment significantly inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of SCC9 cells in vitro. Gelatin zymography and Western blotting results revealed that DA inhibited MMP-2 activity and reduced its protein levels. DA inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK 1/2 in SCC9 cells. According to the mRNA levels detected using real-time PCR, DA inhibited MMP-2 expression in SCC9 cells. This inhibitory effect was associated with the upregulation of the TIMP-2 and downregulation of NF-κB, AP-1, and SP-1 expression. In addition, DA suppressed carcinoma-associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in SCC9 cells. Finally, DA administration effectively suppressed MMP-2 expression and tumor metastases in the oral carcinoma xenograft mouse model in vivo.DA inhibits the invasion of human oral cancer cells and is a potential chemopreventive agent against oral cancer metastasis."
2012,22221560,Asparagus officinalis extract controls blood glucose by improving insulin secretion and β-cell function in streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic mechanism of Asparagus officinalis, a dietary agent used for the management of diabetes. Streptozotocin (90 mg/kg) was injected in 2-d-old Wistar rat pups to induce non-obese type 2 diabetes. After confirmation of diabetes on the 13th week, diabetic rats were treated with a methanolic extract of A. officinalis seeds (250 and 500 mg/kg per d) or glibenclamide for 28 d. After the treatment, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin and total antioxidant status were measured. The pancreas was examined by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunostained β- and α-cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope. Treatment of the diabetic rats with the A. officinalis extract at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg suppressed the elevated blood glucose in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The 500 mg/kg, but not 250 mg/kg, dose significantly improved serum insulin levels in the diabetic rats. The insulin:glucose ratio was significantly increased at both doses in the A. officinalis-treated rats. Both qualitative and quantitative improvements in β-cell function were found in the islets of the A. officinalis-treated rats. The extract showed potent antioxidant activity in an in vitro assay and also improved the total antioxidant status in vivo. In most cases, the efficacy of A. officinalis (500 mg/kg) was very similar to a standard anti-diabetic drug, glibenclamide. Thus, the present study suggests that A. officinalis extract exerts anti-diabetic effects by improving insulin secretion and β-cell function, as well as the antioxidant status."
2015,25976807,"Comparison of physicochemical characteristics, sensory properties and volatile composition between commercial and New Zealand made wakame from Undaria pinnatifida.","This study aims to obtain chemical and sensory profiles of the New Zealand wakame from Undaria pinnatifida for the first time since the lift of its commercial harvest in May 2010. We compared mannitol content, sensory quality and volatile profiles of wakame produced from New Zealand U. pinnatifida with Japanese and Korean commercial samples. Sensory analysis showed that New Zealand wakame processed in August was different from commercially available wakame in texture only. A total of 10 alkanes, 5 ester, 3 alcohol, 13 aldehyde, 8 ketone and 2 alkyne were detected in the two New Zealand processed wakame samples. Mannitol content in freeze-dried U. pinnatifida was also measured and result showed that mannitol was the only free carbohydrate in U. pinnatifida. "
2016,27585435,Nutritional supplements modulate fluorescent protein-bound advanced glycation endproducts and digestive enzymes related to type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Chronic hyperglycemia enhances the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to diabetic complications. Thus, controlling blood glucose levels, inhibiting the formation of AGEs and reducing ROS are key therapeutic targets in early stage type 2 diabetes.The inhibitory effects of seven commercial liquid nutritional supplements against carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes, α-amylase and α-glucosidase, was determined by dinitrosalicylic (DNS) reagent and p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside solution, respectively. Antiglycation activity was determined using the formation of fluorescent protein-bound AGEs. Total phenolic and flavonoid content and antioxidant properties (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl antioxidant activity (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)) were determined for correlation among these components and inhibitory activities.Samoan noni juice showed the greatest inhibitory effects against α-amylase, whereas chlorophyll extracts showed the greatest inhibitory effect against α-glucosidase. Inhibition of α-glucosidase correlated with TFC (r(2) = 0.766; p < 0.01) and FRAP (r(2) = 0.750; p < 0.01) whereas no correlation was observed for α-amylase inhibition. All supplements inhibited fluorescent protein-bound AGEs, with the greatest effect exerted by Olive Leaf Extract, Blood Sugar Support (IC50 = 0.5 mg/ml). The IC50 values negatively correlated with TPC (r(2) = -0.707; p < 0.001) and DPPH scavenging activities (r(2) = 0.515; p < 0.05).The findings of this study highlight the potential of liquid nutritional supplements in managing and treating type 2 diabetes mellitus."
2016,25805601,Virgin coconut oil supplementation ameliorates cyclophosphamide-induced systemic toxicity in mice.,"Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is an unrefined kernal oil, prepared from Cocos nucifera L., having substantial nutritional and medicinal value. Experimental studies have suggested its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory and hypolipidemic effects. The present study assesses its effect on formalin-induced chronic inflammation and cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced systemic toxicity in murine models. Oral administration of VCO effectively reduced formalin-induced paw oedema in mice with more or less similar efficacy as that of diclofenac. The CTX-induced hike in blood urea, creatinine, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and liver marker enzymes in mice was marginally decreased by VCO (8 g/kg body weight) ingestion orally. The liver and kidney catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, together with cellular glutathione and TBARS levels, were found to be improved in these animals. Overall the study reveals the protective efficacy of VCO against secondary toxicity induced by CTX possibly through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. "
2010,20868659,Hypotensive activity of an n-butanol extract and their purified compounds from leaves of Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels in rats.,"We aimed to investigate the effects, identify the active substances and establish the mechanisms involved in the hypotensive activity of an n-butanol extract from leaves of Phyllanthus acidus (PA extract). PA extract caused a decrease in blood pressure of anesthetized rats that was not modified by atropine or propranolol. PA extract caused a persistent dilatation of thoracic aortic rings preconstricted with either phenylephrine or KCl, and these effects were not modified by LNA or removal of the vascular endothelium. For phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings, the dilatory activity of the PA extract was not modified by atropine, propranolol or indomethacin. TEA, glybenclamide or ODQ significantly inhibited the dilatory activity of the PA extract on endothelium-denuded aortic rings. Nifedipine or a Ca(2+)-free medium depressed the aortic rings constrictor response to phenylephrine, and that was further augmented by the PA extract. Adenosine, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, hypogallic acid, and kaempferol were isolated from the PA extract. Each caused a decrease in blood pressure and dilatation of the aortic rings. LNA or removal of the endothelium reduced this activity. ODQ and TEA attenuated the vasodilatory activity of adenosine whereas glybenclamide and ODQ attenuated the effect of hypogallic acid. These results suggest that the hypotensive activities of the PA extract is likely the result of the direct action of these five compounds on the blood vessels by stimulating release of nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, in part through stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, and opening of K(ATP) and K(Ca) channels in the vascular smooth muscle."
2019,30216735,Effects of citrus leaf extract on aortic vascular reactivity in hypertensive rats fed repeatedly heated vegetable oil.,"The prolonged intake of diet containing repeatedly heated vegetable oil can cause hypertension in the long run. 
In this study, the effects of citrus leaf extract (CLE) supplementation on vascular reactivity, plasma nitrite, and aortic structure in hypertensive rats were investigated by the consumption of repeatedly heated vegetable oil [corrected]. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 56) were divided into 7 groups corresponding to the respective diets. For 16 weeks, 1 group was given standard rat chow (control) while other groups were given diets containing 15% w/w of palm oil, fresh palm oil (FPO), palm oil heated 5 times (5HPO), and palm oil heated 10 times (10HPO), with or without the incorporation of 0.15% w/w CLE (FPO+CLE, 5HPO+CLE, or 10HPO+CLE). Plasma nitrite levels were measured before and at 16 weeks of treatment. After 16 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and aortae were harvested for measuring vascular reactivity and for microscopic study. CLE supplementation had significantly reduced the loss of plasma nitrite and attenuated the vasoconstriction response to phenylephrine in the 5HPO group but not in the 10HPO group. However, CLE had no significant effect on the vasorelaxation response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. The elastic lamellae of tunica media in 5HPO, 10HPO, and 10HPO+CLE groups appeared disorganised and disrupted. Obtained findings suggested that CLE was able to enhance nitric oxide bioavailability that might dampen the vasoconstriction effect of phenylephrine."
2016,26748934,The effects of bupropion on hybrid striped bass brain chemistry and predatory behavior.,"Increased use of antidepressants has led to an increase in their detection in final treated wastewater effluents and receiving streams. Antidepressants are intended to modify human behavior by altering brain chemistry, and because of the high functional conservation of antidepressant target receptors in vertebrates, aquatic organisms may be at risk. The antidepressant bupropion is designed to alter brain norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in humans. The objective of the present study was to understand if alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis × Morone chrysops) brain by bupropion would alter this predator's ability to capture prey. The authors exposed hybrid striped bass to bupropion in a static system for 6 d, followed by a 6-d recovery period. During the present study's 12-d experiment, each hybrid striped bass was fed 4 unexposed fathead minnows every 3 d, and the time it took the hybrid striped bass to consume each of those 4 fathead minnows was quantified. After each feeding event, hybrid striped bass brains were harvested and analyzed for changes in several brain neurotransmitter concentrations, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and many of their metabolites. Although bupropion altered the concentration of dopamine and many of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations in the brains on day 3 of the exposure, it did not alter the time to capture prey. This suggests that alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass brain does not alter a predator's ability to capture prey.

2005,15682306,Effects of the plant-derived hallucinogen salvinorin A on basal dopamine levels in the caudate putamen and in a conditioned place aversion assay in mice: agonist actions at kappa opioid receptors.,"Salvinorin A is a naturally occurring hallucinogen derived from the plant Salvia divinorum. Salvinorin A is also a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor agonist in vitro. It has been shown that kappa agonists decrease dopamine levels in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens and cause conditioned place aversion in rodents.To study the effects of salvinorin A on basal dopamine levels in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens, and to determine whether salvinorin A induces conditioned place preference or aversion and changes in locomotor activity in the mouse.In the first experiment, changes in dopamine levels in these brain regions after administration of salvinorin A were measured with in vivo microdialysis. In the second experiment, we examined whether salvinorin A led to conditioned place preference or aversion, and changes in locomotor activity during conditioning sessions.The higher doses of salvinorin A studied (1.0 mg/kg and 3.2 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased dopamine levels in the caudate putamen, but not in the nucleus accumbens, and this effect was completely blocked by pre-injection with 10 mg/kg of the kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. The same doses of salvinorin A caused conditioned place aversion and decreased locomotor activity.The inhibitory effect of salvinorin A on striatal dopamine levels may contribute to its induction of conditioned place aversion and decreases in locomotion in mice. These findings are consistent with the in vitro characterization of salvinorin A as a kappa opioid receptor agonist. It is of interest that a compound such as salvinorin A, that lowers striatal dopamine levels and leads to conditioned place aversion in rodents, is self-administered by humans under certain conditions."
2014,25164035,Nigella sativa oil reduces aluminium chloride-induced oxidative injury in liver and erythrocytes of rats.,"The present study was planned to investigate the protective effects of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) supplementation against aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced oxidative damage in liver and erythrocytes of rats. Simultaneously, a preliminary phytochemical study was affected in order to characterize the bioactive components containing in the NSO using chemical assays. The antioxidant capacities of NSO were evaluated by DPPH assay. The results showed that NSO was found to contain large amounts of total phenolics, flavonoids and tannins. Twenty-four rats were equally divided into two groups, in which group A received standard diet, whereas group B treated daily with an oral gavage dose of 2 ml NSO/kg body weight. After 5 weeks pretreatment, both groups were divided again into two subgroups (A and B) of six animals each and treated for other 3 weeks. Therefore, subgroup A1 was served as a control which received standard diet, but subgroup A2 received AlCl3 (34 mg/kg bw mixed with food). Subgroup B1 received both AlCl3 and NSO; however, subgroup B2 received NSO only. Results showed that AlCl3 exhibited an increase in white blood cell counts and a marked decrease in erythrocyte counts and haemoglobin content. Plasma aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities and total bilirubin concentration were higher in AlCl3 group than those of the control, while albumin and total protein concentration were significantly lower. Compared to the control, a significant raise of hepatic and erythrocyte malondialdehyde level associated with a decrease in reduced glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, activities of AlCl3 treated rats. However, the administration of NSO alone or combined with AlCl3 has improved the status of all parameters studied. It can be concluded that AlCl3 has induced the oxidative stress, altered the biochemical parameters and the hepatic histological profile, but the supplementation of NSO has alleviated such toxicity."
2014,24117220,"Platelet P2Y₁₂ receptors are involved in the haemostatic effect of notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin isolated from Panax notoginseng.","Saponins isolated from Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen have been shown to relieve thrombogenesis and facilitate haemostasis. However, it is not known which saponin accounts for this haemostatic effect. Hence, in the present study we aimed to identify which saponins contribute to its haemostatic activity and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms.Platelet aggregation was analysed using a platelet aggregometer. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were measured using a blood coagulation analyser, which was further corroborated with bleeding time and thrombotic assays. The interaction of notoginsenoside Ft1 with the platelet P2Y₁₂ receptor was determined by molecular docking analysis, cytosolic Ca(2+) and cAMP measurements, and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt assays.Among the saponins examined, Ft1 was the most potent procoagulant and induced dose-dependent platelet aggregation. Ft1 reduced plasma coagulation indexes, decreased tail bleeding time and increased thrombogenesis. Moreover, it potentiated ADP-induced platelet aggregation and increased cytosolic Ca(2+) accumulation, effects that were attenuated by clopidogrel. Molecular docking analysis suggested that Ft1 binds to platelet P2Y₁₂ receptors. The increase in intracellular Ca(2+) evoked by Ft1 in HEK293 cells overexpressing P2Y₁₂ receptors could be blocked by ticagrelor. Ft1 also affected the production of cAMP and increased phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt downstream of P2Y₁₂ signalling pathways.Ft1 enhanced platelet aggregation by activating a signalling network mediated through P2Y₁₂ receptors. These novel findings may contribute to the effective utilization of this compound in the therapy of haematological disorders."

2016,27396794,The Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Rivaroxaban Passes Into Human Breast Milk.,"Thromboembolic disorders frequently require antithrombotic treatment during pregnancy and lactation. Vitamin K antagonists and heparins are the treatment options of choice in breastfeeding women. Factors including the route of administration, discomfort during treatment, and fetal and neonatal safety affect women's choices about anticoagulant therapy. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as alternatives to these agents and may offer advantages compared with vitamin K antagonists. As breastfeeding women were excluded from clinical trials evaluating DOACs, no safety and efficacy data are available for these special patients and, crucially, estimates for infant exposure are lacking. Therefore, the manufacturer recommends against using DOACs during the lactation period. We present the case of a patient who stopped breastfeeding owing to a diagnosis of postpartum cardiomyopathy. Anticoagulation with enoxaparin that commenced after the diagnosis of postpartum pulmonary embolism was switched to rivaroxaban. At that time, breast milk samples were collected and rivaroxaban concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Rivaroxaban appears in human breast milk in comparatively small amounts; its safety has not been determined. "
1984,6418233,In vivo interaction of von Willebrand factor with platelets following cryoprecipitate transfusion in platelet-type von Willebrand's disease.,"Previous studies performed in vitro have indicated that platelets from patients with platelet-type von Willebrand's disease (vWD) have receptors for von Willebrand factor (vWF) already exposed on their surfaces and that the addition of purified vWF or cryoprecipitate to patient platelet-rich plasma under stirring conditions is capable of inducing platelet aggregation and secretion. The present work reports the results of the transfusion of cryoprecipitate in a patient with platelet-type vWD. It is shown that, while factor VIII-related antigen and ristocetin cofactor activities maintain elevated levels for up to 12 hr following transfusion, the highest molecular weight vWF multimers decline rapidly. The platelet count also declines, followed in turn by a rise in the plasma level of platelet factor 4. Shortening of the bleeding time occurs only very transiently. The results of this study provide direct evidence that, in patients with platelet-type vWD, an abnormal interaction of their platelets with plasma vWF occurs in vivo, resulting in the absence of high molecular weight vWF multimers, low platelet counts, and impaired hemostasis that are characteristic of this disease."
2001,11341499,Prothrombin time ratio is reduced by magnesium contamination in evacuated blood collection tubes.,"Magnesium ions were detected in sodium citrate solutions in several lots of evacuated blood collection tubes. The mean concentrations ranged between 1.3 and 1.6 mmol/L. Magnesium was also present in the rubber stoppers of the blood collection tubes and could be leached into the citrate solution. It was shown that magnesium added to citrated plasma shortened the prothrombin time of both coumarin and normal plasma. The effect of magnesium was relatively greater on coumarin than on normal plasma resulting in reduced prothrombin time ratio. Shortening of the prothrombin time was also observed when magnesium chloride was added to dialysed plasma, i.e., in the absence of citrate. These results indicate that magnesium contamination can interfere with accurate INR determination in the control of oral anticoagulant therapy."
2018,29552710,Gold and Silver Nanoparticles Biomimetically Synthesized Using Date Palm Pollen Extract-Induce Apoptosis and Regulate p53 and Bcl-2 Expression in Human Breast Adenocarcinoma Cells.,"Recently, several attempts have been made to use the phytopharmaceuticals from plant extracts as reducing, capping and stabilizing agents for the biomimetic synthesis of various metal nanoparticles conjugated to the phytopharmaceuticals. These biogenic metal nanoparticles are non-toxic and can be used as contrast agents, drug delivery vehicles and photothermal agents for cancer therapy. Herein, we report the synthesis of both silver and gold nanoparticles using the pollen extract of Phoenix dactylifera (Date Palm), characterization using UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, quantitation of phytochemicals capping the nanoparticles using Folin - Ciocalteu's method, cytotoxicity studies on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, cancer cell death analysis using fluorescent microscopy, and modulation of expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. The biosynthesis resulted in stable and poly-dispersed silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles, exhibiting strong and broad surface plasmon absorption peaks. The elemental analysis confirmed the presence of gold and silver of high purity and also the organic moieties from the plant extract acting as capping and stabilizing agents. The biogenic nanoparticles also exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells and showed signs of apoptotic cell death. Immunoassays revealed the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein p53 and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 after the nanoparticle treatment."
1989,2816925,Hereditary sideroblastic anemia with associated platelet abnormalities.,"A 62 year old male (R.H.) presented with a mild anemia (Hb 11-12 gm%) and a history of multiple hemorrhagic episodes. The marrow had 40-50% sideroblasts. Marrow chromosomes were normal. His wife was hematologically normal, while one daughter, age 30 years, had a sideroblastic anemia (Hb 11-12 gm%) with 40-50% sideroblasts in the marrow. Her anemia was first noted at age 15 years. Administration of vitamin B6 did not correct the anemia in either the father or daughter. Platelet abnormalities inherited jointly with this disorder are described for the first time. Both R.H. and his daughter had prolonged bleeding times, with normal PTT, PT times, fVIII:C, fVIII:Ag levels, and vWF multimers, which may rule out a von Willebrand's disease. They have normal platelet numbers but abnormally low platelet adhesiveness and greatly depressed ADP, collagen, and epinephrine responsiveness. Response to ristocetin was in the low normal range, and aggregation with thrombin was normal. While desmopressin completely normalized R.H.'s bleeding time, none of these platelet parameters were improved. No differences in the SDS PAGE protein patterns of RH platelets could be detected in comparison to normal samples. His platelets took up and released serotonin (5HT) normally, and electron micrographs defined no morphological abnormalities. However, no ATP was released from platelets activated with collagen, and when followed by thrombin about fourfold greater ATP was released by control platelets as compared to RH platelets. The dense granule fraction derived from RH platelets contained about 20% the level of ATP, 40% the level of ADP, and 50% the level of 5HT detected in a normal sample. The results indicate that the bleeding disorder is related to a non-classical heritable storage pool defect. The connection between the inherited sideroblastic anemia and platelet defects is obscure."
2017,28770970,OXTR and ZEB1 expression before and after progesterone dosing in pregnant women with threatened premature labor.,"To investigate changes in the peripheral blood mRNA levels of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) before and after progesterone dosing in pregnant women with threatened premature labor.Blood samples were collected from 30 healthy pregnant women with 28- to 33+6-week gestational age and singleton pregnancy (group A) and from 30 pregnant women with singleton pregnancy and threatened premature labor before and 48 hours after progesterone dosing (groups B and C, respectively) for quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay to assess the OXTR and ZEB1 mRNA levels.The OXTR mRNA level was higher in the group B than in the groups A and C, and the ZEB1 mRNA level was lower in the group B than in the groups A and C. Notably, no significant difference was found in the mRNA level of OXTR or ZEB1 between group A and group C.The peripheral blood mRNA level of OXTR was increased, and that of ZEB1 was decreased in pregnant women with threatened premature labor. Progesterone helped to maintain pregnancy by readjusting the mRNA levels of OXTR and ZEB1."
2017,28938193,"Protective effect of thymoquinone against diazinon-induced hematotoxicity, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity in rats.","Several studies have shown that oxidative stress and cell damage can occur in the very early stages of diazinon (DZN) exposure. The present study was designed to determine the beneficial effect of thymoquinone (Thy), the main component of Nigella sativa (black seed or black cumin) against DZN immunotoxicity, hematotoxicity and genotoxicity in rats. In the present experimental study, 48 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups, (eight per group) as follows: control (receiving corn oil as the DZN solvent), DZN (20mg/kg), Thy (10mg/kg), Thy (2.5mg/kg)+DZN, Thy (5mg/kg)+DZN and Thy (10mg/kg)+DZN. After four weeks of treatment, the hematological parameters of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and platelets (PLTs) were evaluated. The evaluation of genotoxicity was carried out using the micronucleus assay. For measurement of cytokine production, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 10 (IL10) and interleukin 4 (IL4) were chosen as immunotoxicity indicators of DZN toxicity. DZN was found to decrease RBCs, WBCs, Hb, Hct, PLTs, butyrl- and acetyl-cholinesterase activity and I FN-γ and increased the micronucleus indices of IL10 and IL4 as compared with the control group. Treatment with Thy reduced DZN hematotoxicity and immunotoxicity, but, significantly, did not prevent genotoxicity. This study showed that Thy (without the significant effect on genotoxicity) decreased the hematological toxicity, immunotoxicity and butyrl and acetyl cholinesterase activity induced by DZN. The success of Thy supplementation against DZN toxicity can be attributed to the antioxidant effects of its constituents."
2006,16368782,"DHT and testosterone, but not DHEA or E2, differentially modulate IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 in human prostatic stromal cells.","Prostate cancer is one of the four most common cancers in the United States, affecting one of six men. Increased serum levels of androgens and IGF-I are associated with an augmented risk of prostate cancer. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T) stimulate prostate cancer cell growth, development, and function, whereas the effects of DHT and T in prostate stromal cells, and of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in prostate cancer or stromal cells, are uncertain. We investigated the actions of DHT, T, DHEA, and estradiol (E2) on insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, IGF-I receptor (R), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-5 in primary cultures of human prostatic stromal cells by assessing cell proliferation, mRNA expression, and protein secretion by MTT growth assay, quantitative real-time PCR, and ELISA, respectively. DHT and T each increased IGF-I (7-fold) and decreased IGFBP-3 (2-fold) mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased IGFBP-2 (2-fold) mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DHEA and E2 did not significantly alter these measures. Flutamide abolished the DHT-modulated increases in IGF-I and IGFBP-2, suggesting that the influences of DHT and T on these measures were androgen receptor mediated. None of the four steroids significantly affected IGF-IR, IGF-II, or IGFBP-5 mRNA levels or stromal cell proliferation. The effects of DHT on IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were more pronounced in stromal cultures that did not express desmin. These data suggest that DHT and T promote prostate growth partly via modulation of the stromal cell IGF axis, with potential paracrine effects on prostate epithelial cells."
2019,30416166,L-Type Calcium Channel-Mediated Zinc Wave Is Involved in the Regulation of IL-6 by Stimulating Non-IgE with LPS and IL-33 in Mast Cells and Dendritic Cells.,"The trace element zinc is essential for the immune system, and its dysregulation and deficiency results in impaired immune function. Recent studies have shown that zinc can behave as an intracellular signaling molecule in immune cells. We have previously demonstrated that L-type calcium channel (LTCC) is involved in the regulation of zinc signaling, Zinc wave and cytokine production by stimulating Fc epsilon receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) in mast cells. However, it is not known whether LTCC-mediated Zinc wave is required for cytokine production by stimulation of toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors in mast cells. Here we report that stimulation of toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors can induce Zinc wave in mast cells and regulate the expression of cytokine genes. The LTCC antagonist nicardipine inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interleukin-33 (IL-33)-mediated Zinc wave and the induction of cytokine genes such as IL-6. Consistent with these results, the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) also inhibited LPS- and IL-33-induced cytokine gene expression. Furthermore, LPS induced Zinc wave not only in mast cells but also in dendritic cells. Together, these observations show that Zinc wave is activated by various stimuli and is linked to cytokine gene induction in immune cells."
2015,26703648,Glyceollin I Reverses Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Letrozole Resistant Breast Cancer through ZEB1.,"Although aromatase inhibitors are standard endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with early-stage metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer, they are limited by the development of drug resistance. A better understanding of this process is critical towards designing novel strategies for disease management. Previously, we demonstrated a global proteomic signature of letrozole-resistance associated with hormone-independence, enhanced cell motility and implications of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Letrozole-resistant breast cancer cells (LTLT-Ca) were treated with a novel phytoalexin, glyceollin I, and exhibited morphological characteristics synonymous with an epithelial phenotype and decreased proliferation. Letrozole-resistance increased Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB1) expression (4.51-fold), while glyceollin I treatment caused a -3.39-fold reduction. Immunofluorescence analyses resulted of glyceollin I-induced increase and decrease in E-cadherin and ZEB1, respectively. In vivo studies performed in ovariectomized, female nude mice indicated that glyceollin treated tumors stained weakly for ZEB1 and N-cadherin and strongly for E-cadherin. Compared to letrozole-sensitive cells, LTLT-Ca cells displayed enhanced motility, however in the presence of glyceollin I, exhibited a 68% and 83% decrease in invasion and migration, respectively. These effects of glyceollin I were mediated in part by inhibition of ZEB1, thus indicating therapeutic potential of glyceollin I in targeting EMT in letrozole resistant breast cancer. "
2016,27912738,Hepatoprotective activity of Lepidium sativum seeds against D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide induced hepatotoxicity in animal model.,"Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is clinical syndrome with very poor prognosis and high mortality there is urgent need for the development of safe and non-toxic hepatoprotective agents for the adequate management of hepatitis. Hepatoprotective effect of the Lepidium sativum ethanolic extract (LSEE) was assessed by D-galactosamine-induced/lipopolysaccharide (400 mg/kg and 30 μg/kg) liver damage model in rats.Hepatoprotective activity of LSEE (150 and 300 mg/kg) and silymarin on D-GalN/LPS induced FHF in rat was assessed using several liver function enzyme parameters. Antioxidant properties as antioxidant stress enzymes were assessed in hepatic Liver as well as mRNA expression of cytokines genes such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 and stress related genes iNOS and HO-1 were determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of apoptotic genes were evaluated through western blot. MPO and NF-κB DNA-binding activity was analyzed by ELISA. The magnitude of hepatic impairment was investigated through histopathological evaluation.Marked amelioration of hepatic injuries by attenuation of serum and lipid peroxidation has been observed as comparable with silymarin (25 mg/kg p.o). D-GalN/LPS induced significant decrease in oxidative stress markers protein level, and albumin. LSEE significantly down-regulated the D-GalN/LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 mRNA expression in dose dependent fashion about 0.47 and 0.26 fold and up-regulates the IL-10 by 1.9 and 2.8 fold, respectively. While encourages hepatoprotective activity by down-regulating mRNA expression of iNOS and HO-1. MPO activity and NF-κB DNA-binding effect significantly increased and was mitigated by LSEE in a dose-dependent style as paralleled with silymarin.Our data suggests that pretreatment of LSEE down regulates the caspase 3 and up-regulates the BCl2 protein expression. The above findings revealed that Lepidium sativum has significant hepatoprotective activity."
,10625934,Chemoprevention of pulmonary carcinogenesis by myo-inositol.,"This abstract summarizes material presented at the ""First International Symposium on Disease Prevention by IP6 and other Rice Components ""held in Kyoto, Japan in June, 1998. The presentation deals primarily with studies of chemoprevention of pulmonary carcinogenesis by myo-inositol. This compound is largely formed by the dephosphorylation of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6, phytate) within the gastrointestinal tract in humans and animals. myo-Inositol is one of a relatively few compounds that has an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis of the lung in experimental animals when administered during the post-initiation period. It prevents pulmonary adenoma formation in A/J mice when fed in the diet subsequent to administrations of benzo[a]pyrene or the tobacco specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) to the mice. A second compound, dexamethasone, also prevents pulmonary neoplasia under the same conditions. Experiments in which both myo-inositol and dexamethasone were administered together in the diet showed an additive inhibitory effect. The significance and utility of the chemopreventive properties of these agents remains to be determined."
2016,27042842,Autologous stem cell transplantation for patients aged 60 years or older with refractory or relapsed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma: a retrospective analysis from the French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapies (SFGM-TC).,"This report retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 91 patients aged 60 years or older with refractory/relapsed (R/R) classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) between 1992 and 2013 and were reported to the French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapies registry. The median age at transplant was 63 years. The majority of patients exhibited disease chemosensitivity to salvage treatment (57 complete responses, 30 partial responses, 1 progressive disease and 3 unknown). The most frequent conditioning regimen consisted of BCNU, cytarabine, etoposide, melphalan (BEAM) chemotherapy (93%). With a median follow-up of 54 months, 5-year estimates of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) for the entire group were 67 and 54%, respectively. Despite the missing data, in univariate analysis, the number of salvage chemotherapy lines (1-2 versus ⩾3) significantly influenced the OS, unlike the other prognostic factors (stage III-IV at relapse, disease status before ASCT and negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan) encountered in younger patients. In spite of its limitations, this retrospective study with a long-term follow-up suggests that ASCT is a valid treatment option for chemosensitive R/R cHL in selected elderly patients, with an acceptable rate of toxicity.

2013,23499686,Azithromycin: a new concept in adjuvant treatment of periodontitis.,"In most patients periodontitis is successfully treated by scaling and root planing, but some studies have shown that certain sites continue to show periodontal tissue destruction despite conventional periodontal therapy. To solve this problem, antibiotics may be administered as an adjuvant treatment. This includes azithromycin (AZM), which is effective against Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and has a long half-life in periodontal tissues. The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of azithromycin as an adjuvant treatment for periodontitis through a review of the literature in Medline, Lilacs and Scielo, combining the keywords ""azithromycin"", ""periodontal treatment"" and ""periodontitis"" in both Portuguese and English languages. To be included, articles had to be clinical trials, randomized, controlled, double-blind or blind, and published between 2001 and 2011. 70 articles were found, of which 12 were selected based on title and abstract. Most studies used AZM as an adjuvant treatment for chronic periodontitis, usually in a single daily dose of 500 mg over three days, and indicated that AZM significantly reduced probing depth and increased periodontal attachment when compared to controls. Furthermore, a reduction in red and orange complex and an increase in bacteria associated with healthy periodontal conditions were observed in subjects treated with AZM. It may be concluded that the use of AZM as an adjuvant treatment for periodontitis improves clinical and microbiological parameters when compared to conventional treatment alone."
2013,23649341,The protective effects of piceatannol from passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) seeds in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes.,"The use of naturally occurring botanicals with substantial antioxidant activity to prevent photoageing is receiving increasing attention. We have previously identified piceatannol and scirpusin B, which is a dimer of piceatannol, as strong antioxidants that are present in passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) seeds. In the present study, the effects of passion fruit seed extract, piceatannol, and scirpusin B on human keratinocytes were investigated. The passion fruit seed extract and piceatannol upregulated the glutathione (GSH) levels in keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that piceatannol is an active component of the passion fruit seed extract in keratinocytes. The pretreatment with piceatannol also suppressed the UVB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the keratinocytes. In addition, the transfer of the medium from the UVB-irradiated keratinocytes to non-irradiated fibroblasts enhanced matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 activity, and this MMP-1 induction was reduced when the keratinocytes were pretreated with piceatannol. These results suggest that piceatannol attenuates the UVB-induced activity of MMP-1 along with a reduction of ROS generation in keratinocytes. Thus, piceatannol and passion fruit seed extract containing high amounts of piceatannol are potential anti-photoageing cosmetic ingredients."
1998,9450795,Epoetin alfa and beta differ in their erythropoietin isoform compositions and biological properties.,"Epoetin alfa and beta are the two forms of recombinant DNA-derived erythropoietin (rEPO), both synthesized in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which are used for the treatment of erythropoietin (EPO)-responsive anaemias. Several batches of each of these rEPOs were compared for differences in their EPO isoform compositions by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and in a range of lectin-binding assays, and for differences in their EPO activities by in-vivo and in-vitro mouse bioassays and by immunoassay. Epoetin beta was found to differ from epoetin alfa in containing: (a) a greater proportion of more basic isoforms, (b) a greater proportion of EPO binding to Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin (which binds N-glycans with nonsialylated outer Gal beta1-4GlcNAc moieties), and (c) isoforms with higher in-vivo:in-vitro bioactivity ratios. Epoetin beta also contained slightly more than epoetin alfa of EPO binding to Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin (which binds N-glycans containing repeating Gal beta1-4GlcNAc sequences), to the leucoagglutinin of Phaseolus vulgaris (which binds tetraantennary and 2,6-branched triantennary N-glycans) and to Agaricus bisporus agglutinin (which binds Gal beta1-3GalNAc containing O-glycans). No differences were found between the two rEPOs in their binding to a further five lectins. The differences between the isoform composition of epoetin alfa and beta, and the smaller inter-batch differences appear to be due to differences in glycosylation. The higher murine in-vivo:in-vitro bioactivity ratio of epoetin beta compared to epoetin alfa could not be explained in terms of differences in their degrees of sialylation, but was consistent with differences in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in human subjects. There have been no reports that epoetin alfa differs from epoetin beta in its clinical efficacy, but the differences between epoetin alfa and beta in some analytical systems suggest that there might be a need for separate international standards for these two types of rEPO."
2015,25976828,"Changes in total nitrogen and amino acid composition of New Zealand Undaria pinnatifida with growth, location and plant parts.","Undaria pinnatifida is known as unwanted organism in New Zealand. However, Wakame is a traditional food made of U. pinnatifida, which is now cultured extensively in East Asia. Therefore, it is important to examine this introduced alga as a potential source of dietary protein for human consumption in New Zealand. This study determined total nitrogen content and amino acid profile of New Zealand U. pinnatifida harvested from the Marlborough Sounds on a monthly basis from June to November 2011. Total average nitrogen content and crude protein content was 21.02 mg/g dry weight and 13.1% of dry weight, respectively. The three most abundant amino acids that contributed to flavour (glutamic acid, aspartic acid and alanine) were present and the most abundant essential amino acids were arginine, leucine, lysine and valine. The results showed that the amino acid content in blades from the exposed farm was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the others. Sporophyll maturation of U. pinnatifida in New Zealand influenced protein content and amino acid composition. Sporophyll, considered as a waste product by many, was found to be a potentially good source of protein."
2010,20358871,Screening and partial immunochemical characterization of sulfite oxidase from plant source.,"Sulfite oxidase [SO; EC 1.8.3.1] catalyses the physiologically vital oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, the terminal reaction in degradation of sulfur containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine. Sulfite oxidase from vertebrate sources is among the best studied molybdenum enzymes. Existence of SO in plants has been established recently by identification of a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a functional SO. The present study was undertaken to identify herbaceous and woody plants (viz., Azardirachta indica L., Cassia fistula L., Saraca indica L., Spinacea oleracea L., and Syzyzium cumini L.), a relatively less explored source, having significant SO activity and to characterize some of its immuno-biochemical properties. The Syzyzium cumini was chosen to characterize SO as it showed maximum enzyme activity in the crude extract as compared to other plants. Absorption spectra of SO revealed two peaks at 235 and 277 nm, but no distinct peak in the visible region could be observed. Crude extract of all the plants were taken into considerations for immuno-biochemical studies. Despite of significant protein structure-functional similarities between plant and animal SO, no cross-reactivity could be established between the two sources of SO. These data suggested that plants SO, however, differed with regards to their immunobiochemical properties."
2016,26621348,Pseudoginsenoside-F11 inhibits methamphetamine-induced behaviors by regulating dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens.,"Although dependence to methamphetamine (METH) is associated with serious psychiatric symptoms and is a global health and social problem, no effective therapeutic approaches have been identified. Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11) is an ocotillol-type saponin that is isolated from Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and was shown to have neuroprotective effects to promote learning and memory and to antagonize the pharmacological effects of morphine. Furthermore, PF11 also shows protective effects against METH-induced neurotoxicity in mice. However, the effects of PF11 on METH-induced preference and dopamine (DA) release have not been defined.We investigated the effects of PF11 administration on METH-induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. Subsequently, extracellular DA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were determined in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after co-administration of PF11 and METH using in vivo microdialysis analyses. Moreover, the effects of PF11 administration on the μ-opioid neuronal responses, DAMGO (μ-opioid receptor agonist; [D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin)-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were investigated to elucidate how PF11 inhibits METH-induced dependence by dopaminergic neuronal hyperfunction.Co-administration of PF11 and METH for 6 days attenuated METH-induced locomotor sensitization compared with treatment with METH alone. In the CPP test, PF11 administration also inhibited METH-induced place preference. In vivo microdialysis analyses indicated that co-administration of PF11 and METH for 7 days prevented METH-induced extracellular DA increase in the NAc and repeated PF11 administration with or without METH for 7 days increased extracellular GABA levels in the NAc, whereas single administration of PF11 did not. Furthermore, DAMGO-induced hyperlocomotion and accumbal extracellular DA increase were significantly inhibited by acute PF11 administration.The present data suggest that PF11 inhibits METH-induced hyperlocomotion, preference, and accumbal extracellular DA increase by regulating GABAergic neurons and μ-opioid receptors."
2019,31112045,Cottonseed Oil Protects Against Intestinal Inflammation in Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Dietary products may protect against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through mechanisms such as forming gut microbiota structures and providing substrates for microbial metabolism. Recently, many studies have been conducted on diets that potentially alleviate or suppress IBD development. To assess the efficacy of dietary oils in treating IBD, we examined the protective effects of olive oil, coconut oil, corn oil, and cottonseed oil in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Treatment with cottonseed oil or corn oil ameliorated the severity of DSS-induced colitis, alleviating weight loss and preventing the shortening of the intestine. Moreover, cottonseed oil or corn oil treatment significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, as well as the expression of oxidative stress markers, including 8-hydroxyguanosine and nitrotyrosine in colon sections, compared with vehicle treatment. Cottonseed oil treatment inhibited intestinal fibrosis by reducing the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and type I collagen, compared with vehicle treatment in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Cottonseed oil protects against intestinal inflammation and the development of intestinal fibrosis by reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, and may therefore be useful as a dietary product with therapeutic benefits for IBD."
2010,20882763,Evaluation of multiple plant growth promoting traits of an isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Psd.,"P. fluorescens strain Psd was isolated from the rhizosphere of Vigna mungo and evaluated for its multiple plant growth promoting and biocontrol properties against F. oxyspornum. Interestingly, this strain not only produces a range of antimicrobial compounds but also solubilizes complexed phosphates and synthesizes phytohormone (IAA). These properties can be assessed to elucidate the agronomic significance and rhizospheric competence of this soil isolate. Biocontrol action has been demonstrated in vitro against some other rhizospheric bacteria, and a phytopathogenic fungus along with wild type E. coli K-12. Genetic evidence for the antimicrobial status of strain Psd has been derived in terms of elucidating a unique combination of phenazine and pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis genes, not reported for any other P. fluorescens strain. The conserved part of antibiotics biosynthesis operon has been PCR amplified, cloned, sequenced and phylogenetic relationship based on similar genes from a few known Pseudomonads has been derived. The properties possessed by strain Psd may enable the bacterium to establish itself successfully in the rhizosphere."
2016,26775978,The use of immobilised digestive lipase from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to generate flavour compounds in milk.,"The aim of this research was to determine the potential of immobilised digestive lipase from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to generate flavour compounds in milk. The lipase was immobilised on hydrophobic resin (Toyopearl® Butyl) and used to hydrolyse milk lipids in a batch reactor. The lipase was stable when immobilised and there was no significant resin fouling or enzyme inhibition between cycles. Eight cycles were achieved before the hydrolysis rate dropped significantly because of physical losses of the immobilised lipase. The immobilised lipase showed the highest specificity towards short-chain fatty acids butanoic and hexanoic acids, the main dairy product flavour and odour compounds. Based on the performance of the reactor, and the ability of the lipase to alter free fatty acid composition and sensory characteristics of milk, the immobilised salmon lipase has potential applications in developing dairy products with unique flavours.

2019,30551541,Polysaccharides from Portulaca oleracea L. regulated insulin secretion in INS-1 cells through voltage-gated Na+ channel.,"The present study was undertaken to determine the involvement of voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) and other mechanism related to insulin secretion in polysaccharides from Portulaca oleracea L. (POP)-induced secretion of insulin from insulin-secreting β-cell line cells (INS-1) cells. Our results showed that the concentration of insulin both in culture medium and inside INS-1 cells were increased under the existing of different concentration of glucose by POP or TTX, respectively. However, the effect POP on insulin secretion and production were blocked by TTX, a VGSC blocker. Meanwhile, POP improved the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, depolarized cell membrane potential (MP) and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i). Furthermore, POP treatment increased the expression level of Nav1.3 and decreased the expression level of Nav1.7. TTX treatment decreased the expression level of Nav1.3 and Nav1.7. On the other hand, POP also elevated the survival of INS-1 cells. These results suggested that POP induced-secretion/production of insulin in INS-1 cells were mediated by VGSC through its change of function and subunits expression and subsequent VGSC- dependent events such as change of intracellular Ca2+ releasing, ATP metabolism, cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane potential, and also improvement of INS-1 cell survival. Meanwhile, our data indicated the potentiality of developing POP to be a drug for diabetes treatment and VGSC as a therapeutic target in diabetes treatment is valuable to be investigated further."
2007,17978499,Effects of the licorice extract against tumor growth and cisplatin-induced toxicity in a mouse xenograft model of colon cancer.,"Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and plays a major role in the treatment of a variety of human solid tumors. However, its toxicity limits the clinical use. Recently, the administration of antioxidants has been suggested to protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The present study was designed to estimate the antitumor activity of the licorice extract alone and in combination with cisplatin, and its protective potential against cisplatin-induced toxicity in a mouse xenograft model. The administration of the licorice extract significantly inhibited tumor growth in BALB/C mice inoculated with CT-26 colon cancer cells. The combination of the licorice extract and cisplatin diminished the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin but promoted considerably antitumor activity of the licorice extract. In mice with cisplatin treatment for 15 d, the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine remarkably were increased by kidney damage, and the serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were elevated by liver damage. The administration of the licorice extract plus cisplatin recovered these functional indices in the kidney and liver to almost the control levels. In addition, the administration of the licorice extract significantly reduced the cisplatin-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, the administration of the licorice extract inhibits the growth of mouse colon carcinoma without any adverse effects, and reduces the cisplatin-induced toxicity. Therefore, the licorice extract may be a candidate for an anticancer and chemopreventive agent. However, cancer patients with cisplatin therapy should avoid the supplementation of the licorice extract."
2014,24096536,"Crocins, the active constituents of Crocus Sativus L., counteracted ketamine-induced behavioural deficits in rats.","Experimental evidence indicates that the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine impairs cognition and can mimic certain aspects of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia in rodents. Crocins are among the active components of the plant Crocus sativus L. and were found to be effective in different models of psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression.The present study was designed to investigate the ability of crocins to counteract schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits produced by ketamine in rats.Crocin's ability to counteract hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia induced by ketamine was evaluated in a motor activity cage. The ability of crocins to reverse ketamine-induced memory deficits was assessed using the novel object recognition task (NORT). The social interaction test was used in order to examine the effects of crocins on ketamine-induced social withdrawal.Crocins (50 but not 30 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia. In a subsequent study, post-training administration of crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed ketamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced performance deficits in the NORT. Finally, crocins (50 but not 30 mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the ketamine (8 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced social isolation in the social interaction test.Our findings show that crocins attenuated schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in rats."
2004,15467215,17alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase cytochrome P450 mRNA expressions and enzyme activities during the development of arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis mice.,"In our previous study, we have investigated the serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. During the study, we found that in normal control mice, serum levels of DHEA in the latter half of the experimental period (13-16 weeks old) were significantly lower than those at the beginning of the experiment (10 weeks old). However, in CIA mice, such decreases were not observed by CII treatment. To examine the cause of the retention of DHEA during the development of arthritis in CIA mice in this study, 17alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase P450 (CYP17) mRNA expressions were measured by real time RT-PCR and the CYP17 enzyme activities were investigated in the liver and testis on days 6, 13, 28 and 48 after CII treatment in DBA/1J mice. There were no significant differences of CYP17 expressions in the liver between control and CIA mice at each experimental day, while a significant increase of expression in the testis of CIA mice was observed on day 48. On the other hand, CYP17 enzyme activities on days 28 and 48 in testis microsome (Mc) from the CIA mice were significantly higher than those of the control on the same day, while no significant differences of activities in liver Mc were observed between the CIA and control mice. These findings suggested that the cause of the retention of DHEA on days 28 and 48 after CII treatment may be the increase of CYP17 expression and the enzyme activities in the testis."
1989,2478305,Differential inhibitory effects of various herb extracts on the activities of reverse transcriptase and various deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases.,"Forty preparations of the extracts from 28 kinds of Asian herbs were tested for ability to inhibit the activities of murine retroviral reverse transcriptase and human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases. Among the 40 extracts, 35 inhibited reverse transcriptase activity and 29 inhibited DNA polymerase alpha activity. The inhibitory potencies of these extracts were expressed as the 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50), at which the enzyme activities were inhibited by 50%. Very strong inhibitions were observed with the extracts from Millettia pachycarpa (Leguminosae) and Mallotus apelta (Euphorbiaceae) as shown by their low IC50 values for reverse transcriptase (0.4-0.5 micrograms/ml) and DNA polymerase alpha (0.9-1.4 micrograms/ml). Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the mode of inhibition of reverse transcriptase by these two extracts was competitive with respect to the template.primer [poly(rA).oligo(dT)] and noncompetitive with respect to deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) substrate. Besides reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase alpha, DNA polymerase I and ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase from E. coli were inhibited by these two extracts. These results indicate that the herb extracts contain as yet unidentified substance(s) which inhibit the activities of reverse transcriptase and cellular DNA polymerases."
2010,20882762,NaCl pretreatment alleviates salt stress by enhancement of antioxidant defense system and osmolyte accumulation in mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek).,"Enhancement of salt (NaCl) tolerance by pretreatment with sublethal dose (50 mM) of NaCl was investigated in V. radiata seedlings. NaCl stress caused drastic effects on roots compared to shoots. Accompanying reductions in length, number of root hairs and branches, roots became stout, brittle and brown in color. Salt stress caused gradual reduction in chlorophyll, carotenoid pigment contents and chlorophyll fluorescence intensity also. Superoxide dismutase and catechol peroxidase activities increased under stress in both roots and leaves. But catalase activity showed an increase in roots and decrease in leaves. In these seedlings, the oxidative stress has been observed under salinity stress and the level of proline, H2O2 and malondialdehyde content were increased. But pretreatment with sublethal dose of NaCl was able to overcome the adverse effects of stress imposed by NaCl to variable extents by increasing growth and photosynthetic pigments of the seedlings, modifying the activities of antioxidant enzymes, reducing malondialdehyde and H2O2 content and increasing accumulation of osmolytes like proline. Thus, mungbean plants can acclimate to lethal level of salinity by pretreatment with sublethal level of NaCl, improving their health and production under saline condition."
2011,21380803,Inhibitory effect of glucodistylin from the bark of Quercus acutissima on human recombinant aldose reductase and sorbitol accumulation.,"A flavanol glycoside, glucodistylin (1) and three polyphenol derivatives, gallate (2), (+)-catechin (3) and (+)-gallocatechin (4) were isolated from an aqueous acetone extract of the bark of Quercus acutissima. Of these compounds, glucodistylin exhibited uncompetitive inhibitory activity against recombinant human aldose reductase with an IC(50) value of 7.2 μM. Furthermore, glucodistylin inhibited sorbitol accumulation by 48.84% at 50 μM. This flavonoid showed therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of diabetes-related complications."
2013,23692771,"Comparative analyses of seeds of wild fruits of Rubus and Sambucus species from Southern Italy: fatty acid composition of the oil, total phenolic content, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the methanolic extracts.","Fruit seeds are byproducts from fruit processing. Characterisation of the bioactive compounds present in seeds and evaluation of their potential biological properties is therefore of particular importance in view of a possible valorisation of seeds as a source of health beneficial components. In this work, we have analysed the seeds of Sambucus and Rubus species in order to identify their bioactive components and to determine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts. We first analysed their oil content, in order to assess the fatty acid profile and tocopherol content. Moreover, the methanolic extracts of the seeds were analysed for their total phenolic contents and antioxidant capacities. Polyphenols were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Furthermore, extracts were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the production of LPS-induced inflammatory mediators (NO, CCL-20) in RAW 264.7 cells. Our findings show that the methanolic extracts from Rubus seeds have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and could therefore represent an attractive source of bioactive compounds for food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical applications."
1996,8987597,Characterization of a matrix protein in the gastroliths of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii.,"As a first step in understanding the calcification mechanism, a matrix protein in the gastrolith of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii was purified and sequenced. The protein was insoluble in acid, but after trypsin digestion, it dissolved in 6 M urea. The trypsin-digested protein dissolved in urea solution was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and designated gastrolith matrix protein fragment. The fragment had a molecular weight of 9658 and a blocked amino terminus. It had tandemly repeated units not reported before at the central part of the sequence, with each unit being Gly-Ser-X1-X2-Phe as the most typical sequence. This peptide was found associated with chitin, a main component of the organic matrix."
1993,7690520,Sequential administration of cyclophosphamide and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor relieves impaired myeloid maturation in Felty's syndrome.,"A patient with Felty's syndrome (FS) and persistent profound neutropenia developed recurrent infections and sepsis syndrome. No impairment of granulocyte-macrophage colony development was observed in vitro. Marrow morphology revealed an absence of mature neutrophil forms despite administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, pretreatment with bolus cyclophosphamide (CY) permitted the growth factor to relieve this impairment of late myeloid maturation and resulted in a brisk, albeit short, burst of neutrophilia. This suggests that immune interference in myelopoiesis can be overcome by growth factor administration if immune activity is adequately dampened by immunosuppressive therapy."
2014,24629979,Melatonin content of pepper and tomato fruits: effects of cultivar and solar radiation.,"We evaluated the effect of cultivar and solar radiation on the melatonin content of Capsicum annuum (pepper) and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) fruits. The melatonin content of red pepper fruits ranged from 31 to 93ngg(-1) (dry weight). The melatonin content of tomato ranged from 7.5 to 250ngg(-1) (dry weight). We also studied the effect of ripeness on melatonin content and identified one group of pepper cultivars in which the melatonin content increased as the fruit ripened and another in which it decreased as the fruit ripened. Under shade conditions, the melatonin content in most of tomato cultivars tended to increase (up to 135%), whereas that of most pepper cultivars decreased (to 64%). Overall, the results also demonstrated that the melatonin content of the fruits was not related to carbon fluxes from leaves. "
2013,23200005,Composition and distribution of the main active components in selenium-enriched fruit bodies of Cordyceps militaris link.,"Selenium-enriched Cordyceps militaris fruit bodies are industrially cultivated as functional food or medicinal food in China and southeast Asia. However, composition of selenium compounds and distribution of the main bioactive components are still unknown. In the selenium-enriched fruit bodies, the main soluble selenium compounds of low molecular weight were identified as SeMet (selenomethionine), and the main selenium compounds bound in proteins were identified as SeMet and SeCys (methylselenocysteine). Trace minerals as Se (selenium), Zn (zinc), Fe (iron) and the main active components as adenosine, cordycepin and carotenoids were mostly distributed in the terminal of fruit bodies, while P (phosphorus) and K (potassium) were evenly distributed in the fruit bodies. The results indicated that terminal of the fruit bodies should be the better materials for production of advanced functional food. So cultivation of relatively short and thick fruit bodies with bigger terminals deserves further research."

Estimation of immunoglobulin concentration in neonatle calves, using total protein measurements, was also evaluated. Single radial immunodiffusion proved useful for quantitation when either class or subclass information was needed. Zinc sulfate turbidity measurements gave accurate results for total immunoglobulin except when hemolysis was present in the sample. A correction factor for hemoglobin that will minimize errors resulting from hemolysis was presented. Serum electrophoresis was also found to be an accurate quantitation method. Large errors were encountered in attempting to estimate immunoglobulin on the basis of total protein."
2017,27427921,A multicenter trial of myeloablative clofarabine and busulfan conditioning for relapsed or primary induction failure AML not in remission at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may produce long-term survival in AML after relapse or primary induction failure (PIF). However, outcomes of HCT performed for AML not in remission are historically poor given high relapse rates and transplant-related mortality. Preliminary studies suggest conditioning with clofarabine and myeloablative busulfan (CloBu4) may exert significant anti-leukemic effects without excessive toxicity in refractory hematologic malignancies. A prospective multicenter phase II trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of CloBu4 for patients proceeding directly to HCT with AML not in remission. Seventy-one patients (median age: 56 years) received CloBu4. At day 30 after HCT, 90% achieved morphologic remission. The incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse at 2 years was 25% and 55%, respectively. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 26% and 20%, respectively. Patients entering HCT in PIF had significantly greater EFS than those in relapse (34% vs 8%; P<0.01). Multivariate analysis comparing CloBu4 with a contemporaneous cohort (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research) of AML not in remission receiving other myeloablative conditioning (n=105) demonstrated similar OS (HR: 1.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.92; P=0.12). HCT with myeloablative CloBu4 is associated with high early response rates and may produce durable remissions in select patients with AML not in remission."
1984,6476571,Chloramphenicol and the neonatal calf.,"Pharmacokinetic values and possible toxic effects of chloramphenicol on bone marrow and hematologic and serum chemical values were determined in newborn calves given the drug (IV) once a week or in repeated doses, 12 hours between doses. The rates of elimination for chloramphenicol and antipyrine also were compared. Chloramphenicol also was administered to older calves by IM and subcutaneous routes, with an apparent bioavailability of 50% to 60%. The elimination half-lives for both chloramphenicol and antipyrine were markedly increased in the newborn calf for at least the first 3 to 4 weeks of life. Despite the high and prolonged serum chloramphenicol concentrations in these calves, there was little or no indication of toxic effects. Bone marrow aspirates did not reveal any signs of intoxication such as cytoplasmic or nuclear vacuolation. Marrow cellularity was not recognizably different from the control group."
2011,25214089,"Antioxidant properties of extract and fractions from Enteromorpha prolifera, a type of green seaweed.","The ethanol extract and its solvent subfractions, partitioned by n-hexane (HX), chloroform (CF) and ethylacetate (EA), from Enteromorpha prolifera were measured for antioxidant activities, and a structural identification of the active compound was performed using spectroscopic techniques. The CF fraction showed the most potent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging activities with strong reducing ability. The DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities of the CF fraction were comparable to the capacities of the positive controls, BHA and α-tocopherol, at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1.0mg/mL. However, little correlation (r(2)=0.03-0.48) was observed between antioxidant activities and total phenolic contents of the extracts. Further fractionation and spectroscopic analysis of the CF fraction suggested that the strong antioxidant activity of the extracts from E. prolifera was because of a chlorophyll compound, pheophorbide a, rather than phenolic compounds.

1996,8616014,Early suppressive effects of chemotherapy and cytokine treatment on committed versus primitive haemopoietic progenitors in patient bone marrow.,"These studies investigated the effectiveness of in vivo administration of cytokines in ameliorating potential marrow damage induced by chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients received 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FLAC) followed by either GM-CSF, PIXY321, or no cytokine. Marrow was obtained before and after one or two cycles of FLAC once blood cell counts had recovered. Colony-forming units for granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) were used to indicate the effect of therapy on recovery of committed progenitor cells responsible for early blood cell recovery. The frequency and number of CFU-GM in marrow obtained after FLAC + PIXY321 were significantly lower than in marrow obtained after FLAC+GM-CSF or FLAC without cytokine. CD34+ cell numbers were also reduced after FLAC + PIXY321. CFU-GM production in marrow long-term cultures (LTC) was used to assess the effect of therapy on primitive progenitors. After 5 weeks the number of CFU-GM in LTC of post-therapy marrow from all three treatment arms was < 15% of the number in pre-therapy LTC. Suppressive effects of FLAC on primitive progenitors were observed even when committed progenitors and CD34+ cells had recovered to pre-therapy levels. These results demonstrate that cytokine treatment did not ameliorate suppressive or toxic effects of FLAC on the functional integrity of the marrow."
2010,20064151,Prolonged responses in patients with MDS and CMML treated with azacitidine and etanercept.,"Combination therapy with azacitidine and etanercept was hypothesized to lead to improved responses in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Thirty-two patients with MDS/chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia were treated with azacitidine + etanercept; 30 completed at least three therapy cycles. At 3 months, nine patients had achieved complete response (CR), two had partial response, 10 had marrow CRs, seven had stable disease, two patients had haematological improvement without marrow response and two patients had disease progression. The overall response rate was 72%; median duration of response was not reached at 2 years. Marrow response rates and duration were improved with azacitidine + etanercept compared to azacitidine alone."
2016,27277000,Anti-platelet activity of panaxatriol saponins is mediated by suppression of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK2/p38 activation.,"Increased platelet aggregation is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and anti-platelet strategy may contribute to its therapy. Panaxatriol saponin (PTS), the main components extracted from Panax notoginseng, has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study is to determine the anti-platelet activity and explore the underlying mechanisms.Inhibitory effect of PTS and its main ginsenosides on agonists-induced platelet aggregation was determined using rabbit or human platelets. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) mobilization was detected with fura-2/AM probe. MAPKs phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting.Our results showed PTS inhibited the rabbit platelet aggregation induced by various agonists (collagen, thrombin and ADP). The three main ginsenosides (Rg1, Re and R1) existing in PTS also showed anti-platelet activity, while their combination exhibited no synergistic effect on rabbit platelet aggregation. Further study demonstrated that PTS and its main ginsenosides also exhibited inhibitory effect on human platelet aggregation. Mechanism study demonstrated that pre-treatment with PTS inhibited the agonists-induced intracellular calcium mobilization. Moreover, PTS significantly suppressed the activation of both ERK2 and p38 by the agonists via reducing the phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38.We proved that PTS is effective in anti-platelet aggregation, which may, at least in part, be related to the suppression of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK2/p38 activation. This study may provide one reasonable explanation for the efficacy of PTS on the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke."
2009,20065621,[Antimicrobial efficacy of benzyl isothiocyanate].,"The potential value of benzyl isothiocyanate (BIT) vapor for food preservation was investigated in comparison with allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) vapor. Measurements of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against various bacteria and fungi indicated that BIT vapor shows higher antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, than AIT vapor. BIT has a similar inhibitory effect to AIT against Gram-negative bacteria, yeast and fungi, except that it was less effective against Pseudomonas fluorescens JCM 5963. Both BIT and AIT have a strong inhibitory activity against yeast and fungi. AIT vapor suppressed growth of total aerobic bacteria in bigeye tuna meat and pork mince during storage at 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C, while BIT vapor had no effect. Also, AIT vapor strongly inhibited mycelial development of Aspergillus sojae JCM 2251 and Penicillium expansum IAM 13777 inoculated on rice cakes, while BIT vapor only slightly suppressed their growth. BIT has antimicrobial activities, but further studies are needed to establish its suitability for use in food preservation."
2014,25233527,"Protective effect of resveratrol on fluoride induced alteration in protein and nucleic acid metabolism, DNA damage and biogenic amines in rat brain.","Fluoride, a well-established environmental carcinogen, has been found to cause various neurodegenerative diseases in human. Sub-acute exposure to fluoride at a dose of 20mg/kgb.w./day for 30 days caused significant alteration in pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant status of brain tissue as reflected by perturbation of reduced glutathione content, increased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, nitric oxide and free hydroxyl radical production and decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes. Decreased proteolytic and transaminase enzymes' activities, protein and nucleic acid contents and associated DNA damage were observed in the brain of fluoride intoxicated rats. The neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin level was also significantly altered after fluoride exposure. Protective effect of resveratrol on fluoride-induced metabolic and oxidative dysfunctions was evaluated. Resveratrol was found to inhibit changes in metabolic activities restoring antioxidant status, biogenic amine level and structural organization of the brain. Our findings indicated that resveratrol imparted antioxidative role in ameliorating fluoride-induced metabolic and oxidative stress in different regions of the brain. "
2004,15449971,Interactions between grapefruit juice and cardiovascular drugs.,"Grapefruit juice can alter oral drug pharmacokinetics by different mechanisms. Irreversible inactivation of intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is produced by commercial grapefruit juice given as a single normal amount (e.g. 200-300 mL) or by whole fresh fruit segments. As a result, presystemic metabolism is reduced and oral drug bioavailability increased. Enhanced oral drug bioavailability can occur 24 hours after juice consumption. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a possible mechanism that increases oral drug bioavailability by reducing intestinal and/or hepatic efflux transport. Recently, inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptides by grapefruit juice was observed in vitro; intestinal uptake transport appeared decreased as oral drug bioavailability was reduced. Numerous medications used in the prevention or treatment of coronary artery disease and its complications have been observed or are predicted to interact with grapefruit juice. Such interactions may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis when dyslipidemia is treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin. Potential alternative agents are pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin. Such interactions might also cause excessive vasodilatation when hypertension is managed with the dihydropyridines felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, or nitrendipine. An alternative agent could be amlodipine. In contrast, the therapeutic effect of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan may be reduced by grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice interacting with the antidiabetic agent repaglinide may cause hypoglycemia, and interaction with the appetite suppressant sibutramine may cause elevated BP and HR. In angina pectoris, administration of grapefruit juice could result in atrioventricular conduction disorders with verapamil or attenuated antiplatelet activity with clopidrogel. Grapefruit juice may enhance drug toxicity for antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, quinidine, disopyramide, or propafenone, and for the congestive heart failure drug, carvediol. Some drugs for the treatment of peripheral or central vascular disease also have the potential to interact with grapefruit juice. Interaction with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil for erectile dysfunction, may cause serious systemic vasodilatation especially when combined with a nitrate. Interaction between ergotamine for migraine and grapefruit juice may cause gangrene or stroke. In stroke, interaction with nimodipine may cause systemic hypotension. If a drug has low inherent oral bioavailability from presystemic metabolism by CYP3A4 or efflux transport by P-gp and the potential to produce serious overdose toxicity, avoidance of grapefruit juice entirely during pharmacotherapy appears mandatory. Although altered drug response is variable among individuals, the outcome is difficult to predict and avoiding the combination will guarantee toxicity is prevented. The elderly are at particular risk, as they are often prescribed medications and frequently consume grapefruit juice."

While muscadine grapes and specifically scuppernongs are found primarily in Southeastern USA, the flavonoid in questionand quercetin is found worldwide as a dietary supplement. "
1992,1530284,[Effect of folic acid and folinic acid on zinc absorption].,"We have investigated the effect of folic and folinic acids on intestinal zinc absorption in humans, using zinc tolerance tests. Zinc (30 mg) as the gluconate was given by mouth to 10 healthy subjects, alone (1), with 200 mg of folic acid (2) or with 200 mg of folinic acid (3). The zinc/folate molar ratio was 1:1. These three oral loading doses were given after overnight fasting to each of the 10 subjects, at weekly intervals. Serum zinc was measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Zinc was also determined in urine collected for a 6-hour period following the ingestion of oral loading dose. The results do not indicated any inhibition of zinc absorption and urinary zinc excretion by folates. The areas under the curves varied from 48.2 +/- 20.0 mumol/6 h (1) to 57.0 +/- 10.3 mumol/6 h (3), peak zinc concentration from 28.8 +/- 7.3 mumol/l (1) to 32.1 +/- 4.1 mumol/l (3), half-life from 3.12 +/- 1.12 h (3) to 3.42 +/- 1.48 h (1), elimination rate constant from 0.22 +/- 0.08 (1) to 0.24 +/- 0.07 (3), mean urinary zinc excretion from 58.1 mumol/6 h (2) to 98.7 mumol/6 h (1) and mean zinc clearance from 1.15 l/h (3) to 3.26 l/h (1). All these indices were not statistically significantly different among the three different loading doses."
2010,19804592,A study of matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity in atopic dermatitis using a novel skin wash sampling assay for functional biomarker analysis.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by a defective skin barrier. Despite the well-recognized role of proteases in skin barrier maintenance, relatively little is known of the contribution made by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to the inflammatory process in AD.To test a simple, novel ex vivo bioassay technique in an analysis of the MMPs present in wash samples taken from the skin surface of patients with AD.Saline wash samples were collected from eczematous and unaffected areas of the skin of patients with AD and from the skin of normal controls. Wash samples were analysed for their MMP content using a functional peptide cleavage assay, gelatin zymography and an antibody array.Using a functional substrate cleavage assay, skin wash samples from AD lesions were shown to contain 10- to 24-fold more MMP activity than those from normal control skin (P < 0.02) and fivefold more than those from unaffected AD skin (P < 0.05); this activity was inhibited by a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor Ro 31-9790. Gelatin zymography and antibody array analysis revealed substantial levels of MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) and MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) in AD skin wash samples as well as lower levels of MMP-10 (stromelysin 2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2; low levels of MMP-1 (fibroblast collagenase), MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) and TIMP-4 were also detected.A simple skin wash technique suitable for the quantitative and functional analysis of biomolecules in AD is described. Using this method we show that MMPs, and in particular MMP-8 and MMP-9, represent an important potential component of the pathology of AD. The method is expected to prove useful in advancing our understanding of AD and in identifying biomarkers for the evaluation of new therapies."
2010,19943982,The combined impact of plant-derived dietary ingredients and acute stress on the intestinal arachidonic acid cascade in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).,"A study was conducted to assess the effect of substituting high levels of dietary fish oil (FO) and fishmeal (FM) for vegetable oil (VO) and plant protein (PP) on the intestinal arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in the carnivorous fish species Atlantic salmon. Four diets were fed to salmon over a period of 12 months, including a control FMFO diet, with varying replacements of plant-derived ingredients: 80 % PP and 35 % VO; 40 % PP and 70 % VO; 80 % PP and 70 %VO. Subsequently, fish were examined pre- (0 h) and post- (1 h) acute stress for blood parameters and intestinal bioactive lipidic mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins). Plasma cortisol responses were greatest in the FMFO group, while 80 % PP and 70 % VO fish exhibited increased plasma chloride concentrations. The n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in intestinal glycerophospholipids from 70 % VO groups significantly decreased in both proximal and distal regions due to elevated levels of 18 : 2n-6 and the elongation/desaturation products 20 : 2n-6 and 20 : 3n-6. Increases in n-6 PUFA were not concomitant with increased AA, although the AA:EPA ratio did vary significantly. The 40 % PP and 70 % VO diet produced the highest intestinal AA:EPA ratio proximally, which coincided with a trend in elevated levels of PGF2alpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in response to stress. PGE2 predominated over PGF2alpha and 6-keto-PGF1alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2) with comparable concentrations in both intestinal regions. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression was an order of magnitude higher in distal intestine, compared with proximal, and was significantly up-regulated following stress. Furthermore, the 80 % PP and 70 % VO diet significantly amplified proximal COX-2 induction post-stress. Results demonstrate that high replacements with plant-derived dietary ingredients can enhance COX-2 induction and synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids in the intestine of salmon in response to acute physiological stress."

We describe herein a female infant, who was admitted to our hospital with life-threatening angioedema because of banana hypersensitivity, 8 months after orthotopic liver transplantation. Food allergies should be screened in all tacrolimus-immunosuppressed pediatric liver recipients who show suggestive clinical symptoms. Banana must be added to allergen batteries during etiologic investigations. Cyclosporine represents an option for drug conversion to prevent organ rejection."
2007,17268067,Potentiation of antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides by carnosol from Salvia officinalis.,"We found that a crude extract from Salvia officinalis (sage) reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound from the extract and identified it as carnosol, one of diterpenoids. Carnosol showed a weak antimicrobial activity, and greatly reduced the MICs of various aminoglycosides (potentiated the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides) and some other types of antimicrobial agents in VRE. Carnosic acid, a related compound, showed the similar activity. The effect of carnosol and carnosic acid with gentamicin was synergistic."
2012,22293351,Matrix metalloproteinase-1 inhibitory activities of Morinda citrifolia seed extract and its constituents in UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts.,"The objective of this study was to examine whether a 50% ethanolic extract (MCS-ext) of the seeds of Morinda citrifolia (noni) and its constituents have matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) inhibitory activity in UVA-irradiated normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). The MCS-ext (10 μg/mL) inhibited MMP-1 secretion from UVA-irradiated NHDFs, without cytotoxic effects, at 48 h after UV exposure. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of MCS-ext was the most potent inhibitor of MMP-1 secretion. Among the constituents of the fraction, a lignan, 3,3'-bisdemethylpinoresinol (1), inhibited the MMP-1 secretion at a concentration of 0.3 μM without cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, 1 (0.3 μM) reduced the level of intracellular MMP-1 expression. Other constituents, namely americanin A (2), quercetin (3) and ursolic acid (4), were inactive. To elucidate inhibition mechanisms of MMP-1 expression and secretion, the effect of 1 on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) phosphorylation was examined. Western blot analysis revealed that 1 (0.3 μM) reduced the phosphorylations of p38 and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggested that 1 suppresses intracellular MMP-1 expression, and consequent secretion from UVA-irradiated NHDFs, by down-regulation of MAPKs phosphorylation."
,16428919,Ginkgo biloba: evaluation of CYP2C9 drug interactions in vitro and in vivo.,"Ginkgo biloba extract is one of the most widely used herbal products in the United States. However, bleeding episodes in patients taking Ginkgo biloba and warfarin have been documented. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies were done to ascertain the influence of ginkgo on CYP2C9, the P-450 isozyme responsible for the metabolism of the most potent warfarin enantiomer, (S)-warfarin. Ginkgo extract inhibited human liver microsomal CYP2C9 with an apparent Ki=14.8 microg/mL, and the inhibition was increased by acid hydrolysis (apparent Ki=9.1 microg/mL). Two open-label, crossover pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects were performed using tolbutamide and diclofenac as probe CYP2C9 substrates. In contrast to the in vitro inhibition of CYP2C9, no interactions between Ginkgo biloba extract and CYP2C9 probe substrates were observed in vivo as evidenced by the lack of effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of diclofenac or on the urinary metabolic ratio of tolbutamide."
2012,22074176,Evaluation of biosafety and intracellular uptake of Cremophor EL free paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation.,"The present study examines the acute, sub-acute toxicity, and cytotoxicity of paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation in comparison to a marketed Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil):ethanol (1:1, v/v) based formulation. In the previous study, Cremophor EL free paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation was developed and characterized. Cytotoxicity of formulation was evaluated by MTT assay using A549 cell lines. Percentage intracellular uptake of paclitaxel elastic liposomal and marketed formulation was determined using a fluorescence activating cell sorting assay (FACS) and fluorescence microscopy techniques. Single and repeated dose toxicity measurement showed no mortality, hematological, biochemical, or histopathological changes up to a dose of 120 mg/kg for paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation, in comparison the marketed formulation showed toxicity at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for paclitaxel elastic liposomal and marketed formulation was found to be 160 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively. Results of FACS analysis showed a 94.6 ± 2.5% intracellular uptake of fluorescence marker acridine orange (AO) loaded in elastic liposomes; in comparison the AO solution showed only a 19.8 ± 1.1% uptake. Paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation seems to be a better alternative for safe and effective delivery of paclitaxel. This study proves the safety and higher intracellular uptake of paclitaxel elastic liposomal formulation."
1980,6156728,Mitogen stimulation of chronic lymphocytic leukemic lymphocytes: defective phytohemagglutinin stimulation independent of immunologic cell surface markers.,"Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 107 untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were analyzed for the presence of surface immunoglobulin (Ig) and the ability to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Four groups were identified based on the cell surface markers: (1) 81 patients' PBL expressed primarily IgM kappa or IgM lambda, 4 further patients' PBL expressed IgM with equal percentages of kappa and lambda surface markers; (2) 13 patients had equal percentages of PBL expressing lg and SRBC receptors; (3) 6 patients' PBL primarily formed rosettes with SRBCs, and (4) in 3 patients and the majority of cells had no detectable markers (null cells). Lymphocytes from all patients within each group were tested for their ability to respond to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). The maximum response in PHA-stimulated normal cell cultures appeared at 2--3 days; for PWM-stimulated cultures, maximal response was at 3--5 days. CLL cultures from all patients in each of the four groups required 5--7 days to develop a maximal PHA response. The response of CLL lymphocytes in all groups to PWM stimulation was similar to normal lymphocytes. Thus, the abnormal PHA response of CLL lymphocytes was independent of the presence or pattern of cell surface markers."
2010,19965667,Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia in the imatinib era: evaluation of its impact within a subgroup of the randomized German CML Study IV.,"The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia is being reevaluated. Whereas drug treatment has been shown to be superior in first-line treatment, data on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT) as second-line therapy after imatinib failure are scarce. Using an interim safety analysis of the randomized German CML Study IV designed to optimize imatinib therapy by combination, dose escalation, and transplantation, we here report on 84 patients who underwent consecutive transplantation according to predefined criteria (low European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] score, imatinib failure, and advanced disease). Three-year survival after transplantation of 56 patients in chronic phase was 91% (median follow-up: 30 months). Transplantation-related mortality was 8%. In a matched pair comparison of patients who received a transplant and those who did not, survival was not different. Three-year survival after transplantation of 28 patients in advanced phase was 59%. Eighty-eight percent of patients who received a transplant achieved complete molecular remissions. We conclude that allo SCT could become the preferred second-line option after imatinib failure for suitable patients with a donor. The study is registered at the National Institutes of Health, http://clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00055874."
2011,22082144,Prevention of hepatorenal toxicity with Sonchus asper in gentamicin treated rats.,"Sonchus asper possesses antioxidant capacity and is used in liver and kidney disorders. We have investigated the preventive effect of methanolic extract of Sonchus asper (SAME) on the gentamicin induced alterations in biochemical and morphological parameters in liver and kidneys of Sprague-Dawley male rat.Acute oral toxicity studies were performed for selecting the therapeutic dose of SAME. 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats were equally divided into five groups with 06 animals in each. Group I received saline (0.5 ml/kg bw; 0.9% NaCl) while Group II administered with gentamicin 0.5 ml (100 mg/kg bw; i.p.) for ten days. Animals of Group III and Group IV received gentamicin and SAME 0.5 ml at a dose of 100 mg/kg bw and 200 mg/kg bw, respectively while Group V received only SAME at a dose of 200 mg/kg bw. Biochemical parameters including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT), total cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were determined in serum collected from various groups. Urinary out puts were measured in each group and also assessed for the level of protein and glucose. Lipid peroxides (TBARS), glutathione (GSH), DNA injuries and activities of antioxidant enzymes; catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined in liver and renal samples. Histopathological studies of liver and kidneys were also carried out.On the basis of acute oral toxicity studies, 2000 mg/kg bw did not induce any toxicity in rats, 1/10th of the dose was selected for preventive treatment. Gentamicin increased the level of serum biomarkers; AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, γ-GT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, creatinine, BUN, total and direct bilirubin; as were the urinary level of protein, glucose, and urinary output. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and DNA injuries increased while GSH contents and activities of antioxidant enzymes; CAT, POD, SOD decreased with gentamicin in liver and kidney samples. SAME administration, dose dependently, prevented the alteration in biochemical parameters and were supported by low level of tubular and glomerular injuries induced with gentamicin.These results suggested the preventive role of SAME for gentamicin induced toxicity that could be attributed by phytochemicals having antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties."
2001,11380423,"Resveratrol, a natural dietary phytoalexin, possesses similar properties to hydroxyurea towards erythroid differentiation.","Resveratrol, a natural dietary polyphenol, has been postulated to be implicated in the cardioprotective effect of red wine and the low incidence of breast and prostate cancers among vegetarians and Orientals respectively. This compound inhibits ribonucleotide reductase as does hydroxyurea, the first therapeutic agent used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Using the human erythroleukaemic K562 cell line as an in vitro model, we show here that 50 micromol/l of resveratrol induced a higher haemoglobin production (sevenfold) in K562 cells than 500 micromol/l of hydroxyurea (3.5-fold). This erythroid differentiation was linked to a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation associated with an equivalent increased expression of p21 mRNA, but with a higher increased level of p21 protein (sixfold) for cells treated with resveratrol than for those treated with hydroxyurea (1.5-fold). We also show that 50 micromol/l of resveratrol and 25 micromol/l of hydroxyurea induced variable but similar enhancements of fetal haemoglobin synthesis in cultured erythroid progenitors for the majority of the sickle cell patients studied. These inductions were linked to, but not correlated with, a variable decrease in erythroid burst-forming unit clone number. Taken together, these results show that resveratrol merits further investigations in sickle cell disease therapy."
2001,11816719,Thiosulfinates inhibit platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding at a calpain-dependent step.,"Thiosulfinates (TSs) are sulfur compounds generated through the processing of different Allium species with antiplatelet property. To further define this platelet inhibitory effect we studied diallyl-TS (Al2TS), dipropyl-TS (Pr2TS). and dimethyl-TS (Me2TS) on platelet responses. The three TSs inhibited dose-dependent platelet aggregation, with IC50 values of 15+/-2, 19+/-2, and 9+/-1 microM for Al2TS, Pr2TS and Me2TS, respectively. TSs had no effect on the expression of a platelet procoagulant surface, measured by flow cytometry as the binding of annexin V-FITC. They inhibited the microparticle shedding and clot retraction. Since the microparticle shedding is a calpain-activation dependent step, we assessed calpain activation by analysis of autoproteolysis in shorter active forms and by talin proteolysis in the presence of TSs. Calpain activation was inhibited by TSs independently of fibrinogen binding. Thus, TSs represent a new category of platelet inhibitors, acting on calpain-induced events."
2012,22790939,Molecular cloning and characterization of L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum).,"L-Galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (GPPase) is an enzyme involved in ascorbate biosynthesis in higher plants. We isolated a cDNA encoding GPPase from tobacco, and named it NtGPPase. The putative amino acid sequence of NtGPPase contained inositol monophosphatase motifs and metal binding sites. Recombinant NtGPPase hydrolyzed not only L-galactose-1-phosphate, but also myo-inositol-1-phosphate. The optimum pH for the GPPase activity of NtGPPase was 7.5. Its enzyme activity required Mg2+, and was inhibited by Li+ and Ca2+. Its fluorescence, fused with green fluorescence protein in onion cells and protoplasts of tobacco BY-2 cells, was observed in both the cytosol and nucleus. The expression of NtGPPase mRNA and protein was clearly correlated with L-ascorbic acid (AsA) contents of BY-2 cells during culture. The AsA contents of NtGPPase over expression lines were higher than those of empty lines at 13 d after subculture. This suggests that NtGPPase contributes slightly to AsA biosynthesis."
2002,11734335,Prevention of liver metastasis of human colon cancer by selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor MMI-166.,"MMI-166 is a selective inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Mice implanted a human colon cancer orthotopically received 200 mg/kg of MMI-166 orally for 5 weeks. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that the administration of MMI-166 remarkably decreased the active MMP-2 expression. Histological examination revealed that MMI-166 showed prominent effect on reduction of the invasive feature of the cancer cells and showed inhibitory effect on tumor vasculature, resulting in the significant decrease of microvessel density of the implanted tumor and liver metastasis compared with the control group. Conclusively, MMI-166 is a potent antiangiogenic oral agent for a human colon cancer."
2011,21239482,Free radical scavenging and antiacetylcholinesterase activities of Origanum majorana L. essential oil.,"In the present study, Origanum majorana L. essential oil (EO) was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and evaluated for free radical scavenging and anticholinesterase activities. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 4-terpineol (29.97%), γ-terpinene (15.40%), trans-sabinene hydrate (10.93), α-terpinene (6.86%), 3-cycolohexene-1-1 methanal,a,a4-trimethyl-,(S)-(CAS) (6.54%), and sabinene (3.91%) as main constituents. Origanum majorana L. EO exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH(•)), hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, reducing power, and lipid peroxidation with IC(50) values of 58.67, 67.11, 91.25, 78.67, and 68.75 µg/mL, respectively; while the IC(50) values for the standard trolox were noted to be 23.95, 44.97, 51.30, 42.22, and 52.72 µg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, cholinesterase inhibitory activity was also found with IC(50) values of 36.40 µg/mL. We can conclude that the marjoram EO has a significant potential to be used as a natural antioxidant and anti-AChE."
2019,30744865,Enzymatic hydrolysis of microalgae proteins using serine proteases: A study to characterize kinetic parameters.,"Protein composition and molecular weight play an important role in the digestibility of microalgae proteins. In this study for the first time, proteinous materials of Dunaliella salina and Spirulina platensis were extracted and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. Then, they are affected by trypsin and chymotrypsin as indicator intestinal enzymes. The results showed that the extracted protein from S. plantesis (ProS) was more rapidly hydrolysed than proteins from D. salina (ProD) because of their lower molecular weight and likely their greater flexibility and open structure. Also, the extent of hydrolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin of ProS were higher and faster than ProD due to the more number of hydrolytic sites in ProS for both enzymes. The catalytic efficiency and kcat displayed that ProS were more suitable substrate than ProD for intestinal enzymes. The results exhibited that chymotrypsin can act better and faster than trypsin on peptide bonds of proteins."
2017,28931215,"Berberine could inhibit thyroid carcinoma cells by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and suppressing migration via PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways.","Berberine, an important natural isoquinoline alkaloid from traditional Chinese medicine, is reported to exhibit multiple pharmacological properties, including anti-microbial, anti-diabetes, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities. Although studies have shown that a wide range of carcinoma cells could be inhibited by berberine, few studies involved thyroid carcinoma. We therefore examined the effect of berberine on papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC, the most common subtype) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC, the most malignant and aggressive subtype). Three thyroid carcinoma cell lines with different aberrant genotypes and one normal thyroid cell line were selected, including C643 (ATC, with H-RAS mutation), OCUT1 (ATC, with BRAFV600E and PIK3CA mutations), TPC1 (PTC, with RET/PTC1 rearrangement) and Htori3 (normal). We found that berberine inhibited the proliferation of C643, OCUT1 and TPC1 thyroid carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (p<0.01, compared with the control), while normal human thyroid cells showed less sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of berberine. Berberine-induced significant mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibitive migration in thyroid carcinoma cells were also observed (p<0.05 or p<0.01, compared with the control). Increased Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved Caspase 3, P21 and decreased Cyclin E1, CDK2 and Vimentin were verified by western blot. Additionally, berberine caused markedly decreased p-AKT1 expression and disturbances in classic ERK MAPK as well as P38 and JNK MAPK pathways in diverse thyroid carcinoma cells. Therefore, berberine could modulate PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma cells, which leads to mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and suppressive migration. Berberine may represent a promising chemotherapy for the treatment of thyroid carcinoma."
2017,28442377,Zerumbone reduced the inflammatory response of acute lung injury in endotoxin-treated mice via Akt-NFκB pathway.,"Zerumbone, a cyclic eleven-membered sesquiterpene, is the major component of the essential oil isolated from the wild ginger, Zingiber zerumbet. There are several beneficial pharmacological activities of zerumbone including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute pulmonary inflammatory disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. In present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of zerumbone on endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Mice were pretreated with zerumbone at various concentrations for 30 min followed by intratracheal administration of LPS for 6 h. Pretreatment with zerumbone not only reduced leukocytes infiltration into the alveolar space but also inhibited lung edema in LPS-induced ALI. Decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-6 caused by LPS were reversed by zerumbone. LPS-induced expressions of proinflammatory mediators, iNOS and COX-2, were inhibited by zerumbone. In addition, NFκB activation and Akt phosphorylation were inhibited by zerumbone in LPS-induced ALI. All these results suggested that the protective mechanisms of zerumbone on endotoxin-induced ALI were via inhibition of Akt-NFκB activation."
2019,30788722,Biosynthesis of Fe3O4@Ag Nanocomposite and Evaluation of Its Performance on Expression of norA and norB Efflux Pump Genes in Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"At present, the universal health problem with Staphylococcus aureus is the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains due to the overuse of antibiotics. Drug extrusion through efflux pumps is one of the bacterial mechanisms to neutralize the bactericidal effect of antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticle as well as Fe3O4 nanoparticle had been previously studied and widely described. Today, the development of green methods for nanomaterial synthesis is an important aspect of research in the field of nanotechnology. Here, we report the biosynthesis and characterization of Fe3O4@Ag nanocomposite by Spirulina platensis cyanobacterium and it impacts on the expression of efflux pump genes in ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (CRSA). The physical properties of biosynthesized nanocomposite measured and confirmed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin in CRSA strains was determined in the presence of Fe3O4@Ag nanoparticles by broth microdilution method. The effect of Fe3O4@Ag nanocomposite on the expression of norA and norB genes was evaluated by real-time PCR. The physical analysis confirmed well-dispersed, highly stable, and mostly spherical Fe3O4/Ag NPs with the average size of 30-68 nm. The results of antibacterial tests showed the synergistic effects of nanocomposite and antibiotics in MIC reduction. Additionally, in the presence of Fe3O4@Ag nanocomposite, the expression of norA and norB genes was decreased more than twofold compared to control. In conclusion, the Fe3O4/Ag nanocomposite can use as an effective inhibitor of antibiotic resistance in medicine."
,12185962,New drugs derived from medicinal plants.,"In China, increasing emphasis has been laid in recent years on research on natural products. About 140 new drugs have been developed from Chinese medicinal plants. For example, anisodamine possesses good effects in the treatment of septic shock and morphine addiction; 3-n-butylphthalide isolated from seeds of celery was shown to be a new cerebral anti-ischemic agent; indirubin was identified as an anti-leukemic drug with no inhibition of bone marrow; huperzine is a potent and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its selective action is superior to that of donepezil; clausenamide was shown to be a potassium channel blocker, its nootropic effect was 50-100 times more potent than that of piracetam; bicyclol was synthesized from schizandrin C isolated from Fructus schizandrae. It has remarkable hepatoprotective and certain anti-hepatitis virus actions; salvianolic acid B is a very strong antioxidant agent with potential anti-dementia effects; yingzhaosu A and artemisinin are anti-malaria drugs containing a peroxide ring which is very rarely seen in natural substances."
2016,27080881,"Salicylic acid treatment reduces the rot of postharvest citrus fruit by inducing the accumulation of H2O2, primary metabolites and lipophilic polymethoxylated flavones.","To comprehensively analyze the effects of salicylic acid (SA) on the storability of Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu), fruits were treated with 2mM SA. The disease incidence of control/SA-treated fruit at 50d and 120d after treatment was 23.3%/10% and 67.3%/23.3%, respectively, suggesting that SA treatment can significantly reduce the rot rate of postharvest citrus fruit. Fruit quality assays revealed that the treatment can maintain fruit firmness without affecting the inner quality. Furthermore, the contents of H2O2 and some defense-related metabolites, such as ornithine and threonine, in citrus pericarp, were significantly increased by SA treatment. Moreover, it was lipophilic polymethoxylated flavones, rather than flavanone glycosides, that accumulated in SA-treated fruits and these can directly inhibit pathogen development. These results suggest that the effects of SA on postharvest citrus fruit may be attributed to the accumulation of H2O2 and defense-related metabolites. "
,16393857,Characterization of the fluoroacetate detoxication enzymes of rat liver cytosol.,"Two forms of fluoroacetate-specific defluorinase (FSD) were purified from rat hepatic cytosol. The first form, FSD1 (molecular weight 38 kDa), contained 81% of the total cytosolic fluoroacetate defluorination activity and did not bind to the glutathione-affinity, orange A or mono P columns used in the purification procedures. The second form, FSD2 (molecular weight 27 kDa), contained only 13% of the fluoroacetate defluorination activity, had a pI = 7.8, and exhibited a high glutathione S-transferase (GST)-like activity towards dichloroacetic acid. The FSD1 proteins were identified from peptide mass data and best matched with rat sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) (short form), although pure sheep liver SDH enzyme did not possess defluorination activity when subsequently investigated. The FSD2 protein was identified from peptide mass data and best matched with the amino acid sequence of mouse and human Zeta 1 of glutathione S-transferase (GSTZ1) and showed a high GSTZ1 specific activity. This study suggests that the major FSD component (FSD1) represents a new and unique dehalogenating or dehydrogenating enzyme present in rat liver cytosol. The minor FSD component (FSD2) is due to the GSTZ1 present in rat liver cytosol. However, it is not yet clear that FSD1 is indeed SDH and FSD2 is indeed GSTZ1, due to sequence homology being less than 60 and 45%, respectively."
2000,10936680,"A glutathione S-transferase inducer from papaya: rapid screening, identification and structure-activity relationship of isothiocyanates.","We have developed a simple system for rapid detection and measurement of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GSTP1) that detoxify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using the cultured rat normal liver epithelial cell line, (RL34) cells. Survey of fruit extracts for GST inducing ability identified both papaya and avocado as significant sources. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) was isolated from papaya methanol extract as a principal inducer of GST activity. Further, the GST inducing ability of a total of 20 isothiocyanates (ITCs) and their derivatives was investigated. Some ITCs showed significant induction, and BITC was one of the most potent inducers among all compounds tested in the present study. The modification of isothiocyanate group (-NCS) or introduction of substituent group to the alpha-carbon modifies GST induction. Moreover, a significant correlation (P<0.01, r=0.913) between the GST activity enrichment and GSTP1 protein induction by ITCs was observed. We also indicated that phenethyl ITC and nitrophenyl ITC, potently inducing GST activity, but not inactive benzyl isocyanate, are potential inducers of intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). Our system of GSTP1 induction is appropriate for the chemical research such as screening and identification of novel type of inducers as well as the structure-activity relationship studies, providing mechanistic insight into essential structural elements for GSTP1 induction."
2002,12635334,[Simultaneous determination of N-methylcarbamates and their metabolites in citrus fruits by HPLC avoiding use of halogenic solvents].,"Twenty-one N-methylcarbamates (NMCs) and 12 of their metabolites or isomers in citrus fruits were simultaneously determined avoiding use of dichloromethane. NMCs in lemon, orange, and grapefruit were extracted with acetone, then the acetone was evaporated off and sodium chloride was added before extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated and the residue was cleaned up on a combined mini-column set of Supelclean ENVI-Carb and Mega Bond Elut SAX cartridges. NMCs were determined by HPLC with post-column reaction and fluorescence detection. All of the NMCs in the orange sample were determined without interfering peaks. However 8 NMCs in lemon extract and 10 NMCs in grapefruit extract were not detected because interfering peaks appeared at similar retention times to those of the NMCs. These NMCs were determined using LC/MS (SIM) and were well recovered. Eighty-three data sets obtained by HPLC and LC/MS showed good similarity, with r2 = 0.9178. Recoveries were 60.1 to 97.8% for major NMCs at a fortification level of 0.1 ppm. The limit of detection by HPLC was 0.005 ppm NMCs in samples and a similar level applied to LC/MS."
2013,23487022,Wogonoside induces cell cycle arrest and differentiation by affecting expression and subcellular localization of PLSCR1 in AML cells.,"Wogonoside is the main flavonoid component derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. It is a popular Chinese herbal medicine with the potential to treat hematologic malignancies. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of wogonoside in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary patient-derived AML cells. Wogonoside exerted antiproliferative properties both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it efficiently inhibited the proliferation of U937 and HL-60 cells through the induction of G1 phase arrest and the promotion of differentiation. We also demonstrated that wogonoside significantly increased the transcription of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) due to its influence on the expression of cell cycle- and differentiation-related genes, including the upregulation of p21waf1/cip1 and downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-Myc. Wogonoside also promoted PLSCR1 trafficking into the nucleus and facilitated its binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) promoter, thus increasing the expression of IP3R1. Finally, inhibition of PLSCR1 expression with small interfering RNA partially blocked wogonoside-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation and disturbed the wogonoside-associated molecular events. The results of this study therefore suggest that wogonoside may represent a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AML."
2013,23993536,Chemical characterisation and speciation of organic selenium in cultivated selenium-enriched Agaricus bisporus.,"The selenium concentration in Agaricus bisporus cultivated in growth compost irrigated with sodium selenite solution increased by 28- and 43-fold compared to the control mushroom irrigated solely with water. Selenium contents of mushroom proteins increased from 13.8 to 60.1 and 14.1 to 137 μgSe/g in caps and stalks from control and selenised mushrooms, respectively. Selenocystine (SeCys; detected as [SeCys]2 dimer), selenomethionine (SeMet), and methyl-selenocysteine (MeSeCys) were separated, identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry from water solubilised and acetone precipitated proteins, and significant increases were observed for the selenised mushrooms. The maximum selenoamino acids concentration in caps and stalks of control/selenised mushrooms was 4.16/9.65 μg/g dried weight (DW) for SeCys, 0.08/0.58 μg/g DW for SeMet, and 0.031/0.10 μg/g DW for MeSeCys, respectively. The most notable result was the much higher levels of SeCys accumulated by A. bisporus compared to SeMet and MeSeCys, for both control and selenised A. bisporus."
2015,25952872,"Characterization of free, conjugated and bound phenolics and lipophilic antioxidants in regular- and non-darkening cranberry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).","Cranberry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from 7 different cultivars were characterized for phytochemicals and assessed for antioxidant activities. In vitro colorimetric methods were used to measure total phenolic (TPC) and total proanthocyanidin (PAC) contents. Free, conjugated and bound phenolic acids and flavonoids were also identified and quantified using HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS(n). Regular-darkening (RD) seeds contained higher TPC, PAC and flavonoids which were absent in the non-darkening (ND) seeds. Bound and conjugated phenolics in RD and ND mainly included cinnamic and benzoic acids. DPPH, FRAP and ORAC showed strong positive correlation with TPC, PAC, and with specific phenolics such as free catechin and bound p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Lipophilic extracts were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (69.20-76.89%). Carotenoid and tocopherol were limited to γ-tocopherol and β-carotene. Results from this study can contribute to the development of cranberry bean cultivars with increased health benefits and addresses specific phenolic contributors to antioxidant activity. "
2012,22471932,"Ginsenoside-Rp1 inhibits platelet activation and thrombus formation via impaired glycoprotein VI signalling pathway, tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation.","Ginsenosides are the main constituents for the pharmacological effects of Panax ginseng. Such effects of ginsenosides including cardioprotective and anti-platelet activities have shown stability and bioavailability limitations. However, information on the anti-platelet activity of ginsenoside-Rp1 (G-Rp1), a stable derivative of ginsenoside-Rg3, is scarce. We examined the ability of G-Rp1 to modulate agonist-induced platelet activation.G-Rp1 in vitro and ex vivo effects on agonist-induced platelet-aggregation, granule-secretion, [Ca(2+) ](i)  mobilization, integrin-α(IIb) β(3)  activation were examined. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and MAPK expressions and levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signalling pathway components were also studied. G-Rp1 effects on arteriovenous shunt thrombus formation in rats or tail bleeding time and ex vivo coagulation time in mice were determined. KEY RESULT: G-Rp1 markedly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin or ADP. While G-Rp1 elevated cAMP levels, it dose-dependently suppressed collagen-induced ATP-release, thromboxane secretion, p-selectin expression, [Ca(2+) ](i)  mobilization and α(IIb) β(3)  activation and attenuated p38(MAPK)  and ERK2 activation. Furthermore, G-Rp1 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple components (Fyn, Lyn, Syk, LAT, PI3K and PLCγ2) of the GPVI signalling pathway. G-Rp1 inhibited in vivo thrombus formation and ex vivo platelet aggregation and ATP secretion without affecting tail bleeding time and coagulation time, respectively.G-Rp1 inhibits collagen-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation through modulation of early GPVI signalling events, and this effect involves VASP stimulation, and ERK2 and p38(-MAPK)  inhibition. These data suggest that G-Rp1 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases involving aberrant platelet activation."
2011,21457137,The effect of ethyl acetate extract of pomelo mix on systemic exposure of verapamil in rabbits.,"The effect of ethyl acetate extract of pomelo fruit on systemic exposure of verapamil was explored in rabbits. Two groups each of 8 locally-inbred New Zealand male rabbits were used. The first group was used for single-dose treatment (both verapamil and pomelo extract). The second group was used for multiple-dose treatment, pomelo extract (once daily for 14 days) and verapamil single doses (at days 7 and 14). A verapamil dose of 30 mg/kg and a pomelo extract dose of 45 mg/kg were used. Single-dose treatment with pomelo extract resulted in a minor change in mean C(max) of verapamil in plasma, while a decrease of 37.8% in AUC(0-24) and 28.3% in AUC(0-∞) was observed but did not reach statistical significance. After the first period of multiple dose treatment (pomelo extract for 7 days), the combination increased the concentration of verapamil in plasma with a significant increase in mean C(max), AUC(0-24) and AUC(0-∞) by 461.9%, 299.7%, and 261.1%, respectively (p values were 0.005, 0.002, and 0.006, respectively). In contrast, after the second period (day 14 of pomelo extract use), the combination decreased the concentration of verapamil in the plasma with a substantial decrease in mean C(max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-∞), by 68.2%, 69.7% and 58.3%, respectively. This decrease did not reach statistical significance (p values were 0.073, 0.081 and 0.083, respectively). The T(max) was not affected significantly in both studies. The study illustrates a complex time-dependent interaction between verapamil and the ethyl acetate extract of pomelo mix. More intensive studies are needed to further understand the nature of the interaction."
2013,23370362,Salmon calcitonin reduces oxaliplatin-induced cold and mechanical allodynia in rats.,"Oxaliplatin is commonly used anti-cancer drugs, but it frequently causes peripheral neuropathic pain. Recently, we reported that elcatonin, a synthetic analog of eel calcitonin, attenuated the oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced cold and mechanical allodynia in rats. In the present study, we determined whether salmon calcitonin also had anti-allodynic effects on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in rats. The rats were treated with a single dose of oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). Oxaliplatin resulted in cold and mechanical allodynia. We assessed the anti-allodynic effects of subcutaneously administered salmon calcitonin (20 U/kg/d) by cold stimulation (8°C) directly to the hind paw of the rats and by using the von Frey test. Salmon calcitonin almost completely reversed the effects of both cold and mechanical allodynia. These results suggest that salmon calcitonin is also useful for treatment of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy clinically."
2018,30100434,Seaweeds from the Portuguese coast as a source of proteinaceous material: Total and free amino acid composition profile.,"The total protein content and the (total and free) amino acid composition of nine edible species of red, brown and green seaweeds collected in the Portuguese North-Central coast were quantified to assess their potential contribution to the recommended dietary intake. Whenever possible, the protein and amino acid composition was compared with that of commercial European seaweeds. The protein content was the highest (P < 0.05) in red species (19.1-28.2 g/100 g dw), followed by the green seaweed Ulva spp. (20.5-23.3 g/100 g dw), with the lowest content found in brown seaweeds (6.90-19.5 g/100 g dw). Brown seaweeds presented the lowest mean contents of essential amino acids (EAAs) (41.0% protein) but significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations of non-essential amino acids (36.1% protein) and free amino acids (6.47-24.0% protein). Tryptophan, methionine and leucine were the limiting EAAs in all species. In contrast, lysine was found in high concentrations, especially in red (2.71-3.85% protein) and green (2.84-4.24% protein) seaweeds."
2018,29525674,"In renal hypertension, Cirsium japonicum strengthens cardiac function via the intermedin/nitric oxide pathway.","Cirsium japonicum, a constituent of traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to exert inflammatory effects as well as to improve the circulation and thus to counteract hematologic stasis. Studies have demonstrated that intermedin (IMD) has protective effects on hypertension in rats by regulating the Ang/NO metabolic pathway. In this study, we investigated whether by regulating the expression of IMD, Cirsium japonicum could improve cardiac function in rats with 2k1c-induced renal hypertension. Renal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by occluding the renal artery. The rats were maintained on a normal diet and randomly divided into four groups: sham, 2k1c, 2k1c with Cirsium japonicum (1.8 g/kg per day) and 2k1c with IMD (n = 10 in each group). Cardiac function, plasma angiotensin II (Ang II), IMD, serum nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), as well as the expression of IMD and adrenomedullin (ADM) in the aorta and left ventricle were analyzed. Administration of Cirsium japonicum or IMD significantly strengthened cardiac function in 2k1c-induced rats, increased serum NO and NOS levels, reduced plasma Ang II, and upregulated IMD expression in the aorta and left ventricle. These results demonstrate that Cirsium japonicum has cardioprotective effects on 2k1c-induced renal hypertension in rats via the IMD/NO pathway."
,11131667,Milk fat conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) inhibits growth of human mammary MCF-7 cancer cells.,"The relationship between growth and the antioxidant enzyme defence system in human MCF-7 (breast) cancer cells treated with bovine milk fat enriched with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was studied. Milk enriched in CLA was obtained from cows on pasture supplemented with full fat rapeseeds and full fat soyabeans (1). Cell number decreased up to 90% (p < 0.05) and lipid peroxidation increased 15-fold (p < 0.05) following incubation of MCF-7 cells for 8 days with increasing levels of milk fat yielding CLA concentrations between 16.9 and 22.6 ppm. Growth suppression and prooxidant effects of milk fat CLA were independent of the variable composition of the milk fat samples, suggesting that CLA was the active ingredient in milk fat responsible for the cytotoxic effect. Mixtures containing isomers of CLA (c9, t11-, t10, c12-, c11, t13- and minor amounts of other isomers) and linoleic acid (LA) at similar concentrations to the milk fat samples were as effective at inhibiting growth and stimulating peroxidation of MCF-7 cells as the milk fatty acids. Incubation of the cells with the c9, t11 CLA isomer (20 ppm) or the mixture of CLA isomers (20 ppm) for 8 days resulted in a 60% decrease (p < 0.05) in viability compared with untreated controls and was significantly (p < 0.05) more effective than incubation with the t10, c12 CLA isomer (20 ppm), which caused only a 15% decrease in cell numbers under similar conditions. A 25% increase (p < 0.05) in cell proliferation occurred when LA (20 ppm) alone was incubated with MCF-7 cells for 8 days. 14C-CLA was preferentially incorporated into the phospholipid fraction of the MCF-7 cell lipids in a dose-dependent manner and CLA accumulated in cell membranes more efficiently when the cells were incubated in the presence of milk fat than the c9, t11 synthetic CLA isomer. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were induced in MCF-7 cells exposed to milk fat (containing 16.9-22.6 ppm CLA) over 8 days. The data indicate that milk fat triglyceride-bound CLA, consisting primarily of the c9, t11 isomer, was cytotoxic towards MCF-7 cells."
,16772772,Warfarin-cranberry juice interaction resulting in profound hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding.,"Few published reports have suggested a substantial interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin, although a definite link could not be established. We encountered a patient taking stable doses of warfarin who developed major bleeding and high INR soon after starting daily cranberry juice. No other identifiable reasons for the high INR were apparent. The patient resumed his usual dose of warfarin after stopping the juice. This case suggests a definite relationship between cranberry juice and warfarin."
2011,21622478,Premature adrenarche: novel lessons from early onset androgen excess.,"Adrenarche reflects the maturation of the adrenal zona reticularis resulting in increased secretion of the adrenal androgen precursor DHEA and its sulphate ester DHEAS. Premature adrenarche (PA) is defined by increased levels of DHEA and DHEAS before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys and the concurrent presence of signs of androgen action including adult-type body odour, oily skin and hair and pubic hair growth. PA is distinct from precocious puberty, which manifests with the development of secondary sexual characteristics including testicular growth and breast development. Idiopathic PA (IPA) has long been considered an extreme of normal variation, but emerging evidence links IPA to an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome (MS) and thus ultimately cardiovascular morbidity. Areas of controversy include the question whether IPA in girls is associated with a higher rate of progression to the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and whether low birth weight increases the risk of developing IPA. The recent discoveries of two novel monogenic causes of early onset androgen excess, apparent cortisone reductase deficiency and apparent DHEA sulphotransferase deficiency, support the notion that PA may represent a forerunner condition for PCOS. Future research including carefully designed longitudinal studies is required to address the apparent link between early onset androgen excess and the development of insulin resistance and the MS."
2017,28466395,Over-the-counter medications containing diphenhydramine and doxylamine used by older adults to improve sleep.,"Background The unintentional misuse of over-the-counter sleep aids among older adults is an important public health problem and a focus of Healthy People 2020. Accordingly, the 2015 Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults recommends that individuals 65 years or older avoid use of diphenhydramine and doxylamine; however, many over-the-counter sleep products contain these active ingredients. Objective To identify the proportion of older adults using an over-the-counter medication containing diphenhydramine or doxylamine, and compare their characteristics with older adults using an over-the-counter medication that does not contain these ingredients. Setting Study participants were recruited from the Community Registry of the Pittsburgh Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center. Method The study sample was taken from a larger survey of 1025 participants on sleep health and over-the-counter sleep medication use conducted from February to April 2015. A subset of 169 participants aged 65 and older reporting taking at least one over-the-counter product to improve sleep within the past 30 days (16.5%) were selected for our analysis on associations between participant characteristics and potentially inappropriate use of over-the-counter sleep medications. Main outcome measure The proportion and characteristics of older adults taking at least one over-the-counter medication containing diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Results Of the 223 over-the-counter sleep medications listed by participants, 115 (52%) contained diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Using the Beers Criteria, we found that more than half of participants (59%) had used a potentially inappropriate over-the-counter medication containing diphenhydramine or doxylamine to improve sleep within the past 30 days. Participants taking at least one diphenhydramine or doxylamine containing medication were less likely to be aware of any safety risks in taking over-the-counter sleep medications than participants not taking these products (38 vs 49%, p = 0.016). Conclusion A majority of older adults in a limited sample from the United States taking an over-the-counter medication to improve sleep are taking a product containing diphenhydramine or doxylamine, both of which are classified as potentially inappropriate for older adults. Awareness of the safety risks of over-the-counter medications and addressing conditions that impact sleep quality could be facilitated through consultation with pharmacists and other healthcare providers."
2017,28353139,"Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals in Various Tissues of Some Fish Species and Green Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) from İskenderun Bay, Turkey, and Risk Assessment for Human Health.","In this study, concentrations of heavy metals were determined by ICP-MS in the edible tissues of common sole (Solea solea Linnaeus, 1758), whiting (Merlangius merlangus Linnaeus, 1758), silver sillago (Sillago sihama Forsskål, 1775) and muscle-exoskeleton of green tiger shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus De Haan, 1844), from the seas of İskenderun Bay, Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey, in January-February, 2016. The lowest and highest mean concentrations of Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni, Hg, As, Pb, and Co in fish and shrimp' muscles were found, respectively, as follows: 0.166-0.382, 0.134-0.336, 0.005-0.008, 0.091-0.140, 0.026-0.228, 1.741-29.254, 0.087-0.110, and <0.0005-0.027 mg kg-1; in the skin and exoskeleton, the values were found, respectively, as 0.103-15.819, 0.301-0.778, 0.007-0.026, 0.115-0.513, 0.021-0.243, 1.548-17.930, 0.148-0.295, and <0.0005-0.140 mg kg-1. According to the results, mean concentrations of all metals in the muscles of fish, except for arsenic and chromium, were found to be below certain legal limit values, especially arsenic levels in shrimp that were found to be above all the legal limit values. Also, the hazard quotients (HQ) of individual heavy metals in fish and shrimp, except for As, revealed safe levels for human consumption. However, the HQ values of estimated inorganic As exceeded 1 in the muscles of shrimp (P. semisulcatus), which may constitute a risk to public health."

2015,25442561,A new HPLC method for the detection of iodine applied to natural samples of edible seaweeds and commercial seaweed food products.,"Rich in micronutrients and considered to contain high iodine levels, seaweeds have multiple applications as food/supplements and nutraceuticals with potential health implications. Here, we describe the development and validation of a new analytical method to quantify iodine as iodide (I(-)) using an isocratic HPLC system with UV detection; algal iodine was converted to I(-) via dry alkaline incineration. The method was successfully applied to 19 macroalgal species from three taxonomic groups and five commercially available seaweed food products. Fesh kelps contained highest levels, reaching >1.0% per dry weight (DW), but concentrations differed amongst thallus parts. In addition to kelps, other brown (Fucales: ∼ 0.05% DW) and some red species (∼ 0.05% DW) can also serve as a rich source of iodine; lowest iodine concentrations were detected in green macroalgae (∼ 0.005% DW), implying that quantities recommended for seaweed consumption may require species-specific re-evaluation to reach adequate daily intake levels."
2003,14519964,Ethanol fraction of Aralia elata Seemann enhances antioxidant activity and lowers serum lipids in rats when administered with benzo(a)pyrene.,"Aralia elata Seemann is an edible mountain vegetable in Korea containing saponin, alkaloid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, methyl eicosanoate and hexacosol, and is known to manifest an effect on cardiac infarction, gastric ulcer, colitis, and enervation. This study has examined the effects of Aralia elata Seemann ethanol extract on antioxidant enzyme systems and lipid metabolism in rats along with benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) administration. Rats were divided into four groups: control (C), an extract fed group (CE), a B(a)P fed group (CB), and a B(a)P and extract fed group (CBE). The ethanol extracts of Aralia elata Seemann (50 mg/kg body weight) were fed to the rats for 4 weeks by stomach tubing. Extract administration increased the antioxidant activities of glutathione sulfur transferase (GST). Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cu,Zn-SOD activities were stimulated. Catalase activities were increased by 50% with extract feeding. Cu,Zn-SOD was greatly enhanced from 0.10 unit to 0.18 unit and catalase activity also was increased. Serum alpha-tocopherol was markedly increased by the extracts. The ethanol fraction of Aralia elata Seemann decreased total serum cholesterol. However, serum HDL-cholesterol was increased by 35% (p<0.05). The results indicate that Aralia elata Seemann exerts antioxidant and strong hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic effects in vivo with the administration of B(a)P."
1998,9786496,Role of transforming growth factor-beta pathway in the mechanism of wound healing by saponin from Ginseng Radix rubra.,"1. The effects of saponin from Ginseng Radix rubra on extracellular matrix metabolism, the activation and synthesis of TGF-beta1, and the modification of TGF-beta receptor in fibroblasts were examined to elucidate the contribution of the TGF-beta pathway to the mechanism of wound healing by saponin. 2. Fibronectin synthesis was analysed by the immunoprecipitation method. Activation and synthesis of TGF-beta1 were measured by ELISA. The expressions of TGF-beta receptors in fibroblasts were examined at protein and mRNA levels by the cross-linking method and Northern blot analysis, respectively. 3. The fibronectin synthesis increased 2.3- and 3.9-fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 microg ml(-1) of saponin, respectively, compared with that in non-treated cells. Fibronectin synthesis stimulated with 10 microg ml(-1) of saponin was inhibited with 69% by 5 microg ml(-1) of an anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. mRNA of TGF-beta type I receptor increased 4.8- and 4.4-fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 microg ml(-1) of saponin, respectively, and that of TGF-beta type II receptor also increased 3.4- and 3.2-fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 microg ml(-1) of saponin, respectively. The significant increases of TGF-beta type I and II receptors and of fibronectin synthesis were observed at the same concentrations of saponin. TGF-beta content increased 1.74- and 1.87-fold at conditioned medium of fibroblasts treated with 100 and 250 microg ml(-1) of saponin, respectively, higher concentrations than those which accelerated fibronectin synthesis. Furthermore, the active TGF-beta content was below 10% of total TGF-beta at each concentration of saponin. 4. These results indicate that saponin stimulates fibronectin synthesis through the changes of TGF-beta receptor expressions in fibroblasts."

2010,20361304,Individual and interacting effects of formulation variables on the tensile strength and microbial survival in diclofenac tablets.,"A work has been done to study the individual and interacting effects of formulation variables, using a 23 fractional factorial design. The effects of five variables, namely, relative density of tablets, nature and concentration of binder, compression process, and compression speed on the tensile strength and percent survival of Bacillus subtilis spores in diclofenac tablet formulations were determined. The effects of these variables were studied both singly and when they interact with each other in two fractional designs (Woolfall, 1964). The first fraction comprised of nature (N) and concentration (C) of binder, and relative density of tablets (D) while in the second fraction, compression speed (S), compression process (P) and relative density of tablets (D) were studied. In the first fraction, concentration of binder had the highest effect on tensile strength with the ranking C > D > N for both DCS (formulation containing Corn starch) and DDCP (formulation containing DCP), and C > N > D for DL (formulation containing Lactose). On the percent survival of Bacillus subtilis, relative density of tablets showed the highest effect with the ranking D > C > N for both DCS and DL, and D > N > C for DDCP. In the second fraction, compression speed generally had a great effect on both tensile strength and percent survival in all the formulations. The results of interactions among the variables showed the highest effect on tensile strength from interaction between concentration of binder and relative density of tablets (C-D) while interaction between compression speed and relative density of tablets (S-D) had the highest effect on percent survival in all the formulations. A fractional factorial design proved suitable in determining the magnitude of both the individual and interacting effects of the variables. The study showed that each of these variables has to be properly considered in producing tablets of satisfactory strength and reduced microbial survival."
2019,30850949,Manilkara zapota (L.) P. Royen Leaf Extract Derived Silver Nanoparticles Induce Apoptosis in Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells Without Affecting Human Lymphocytes or Erythrocytes.,"Plant-derived synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has found wide biomedical applications including cancer cure. This report deals with biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (MZLAgNPs) employing leaf extracts of Manilkara zapota (L.) under optimized conditions. Characterization of MZLAgNPs using UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, and FESEM analyses revealed that the particles were predominantly spherical averaging 24 nm in size. Their cellular effects were assessed by MTT assay, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy of cells stained with propidium iodide, acridine orange/ethidium bromide, and annexin V-FITC to visualize signs of apoptosis. Evaluation of cell proliferation by clonogenic assay, wound healing ability by scratch assay and cell cycle distribution by flow-cytometry was also carried out. Apoptosis-related gene expressions were analyzed by RTq-PCR and western blot analysis. MZLAgNPs selectively inhibited growth of colorectal carcinoma HCT116, HeLa, and non-small lung carcinoma A549 cells, dose-dependently with IC50 concentrations of 8, 16, and 29 μg/mL respectively, following 72-h treatment, without affecting growth of normal human lymphocytes and erythrocytes. Apoptosis induction was observed by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of apoptotic-related genes - PUMA, cas-3, cas-8, cas-9, and BAX, expression of caspase 3, and occurrence of PARP cleavage were observed in MZLAgNPs/cisplatin treated cells. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate the therapeutic potential of biogenic MZLAgNPs as an effective agent for killing colorectal carcinoma cells by apoptosis induction."
2009,19694739,Effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in healthy volunteers.,"To assess the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in healthy volunteers.Fourteen healthy male volunteers (age range 19-25 years) received orally administered bupropion (150 mg) alone and during treatment with G. biloba 240 mg day(-1) (two 60-mg capsules taken twice daily) for 14 days. Serial blood samples were obtained over 72 h after each bupropion dose, and used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion and its CYP2B6-catalysed metabolite, hydroxybupropion.Ginkgo biloba extract administration resulted in no significant effects on the AUC(0-infinity) of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. Bupropion mean AUC(0-infinity) value was 1.4 microg.h ml(-1)[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.6] prior to G. biloba treatment and 1.2 microg.h ml(-1) (95% CI 1.1, 1.4) after 14 days of treatment. Hydroxybupropion mean AUC(0-infinity) value was 8.2 microg.h ml(-1) (95% CI 6.5, 10.4) before G. biloba administration and 8.7 microg.h ml(-1) (95% CI 7.1, 10.6) after treatment. The C(max) of hydroxybupropion increased from 221.8 ng ml(-1) (95% CI 176.6, 278.6) to 272.7 ng ml(-1) (95% CI 215.0, 345.8) (P = 0.038) and the t(1/2) of hydroxybupropion fell from 25.0 h (95% CI 22.7, 27.5) to 21.9 h (95% CI 19.9, 24.1) (P = 0.000).Ginkgo biloba extract administration for 14 days does not significantly alter the basic pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion in healthy volunteers. Although G. biloba extract treatment appears to reduce significantly the t(1/2) and increase the C(max) of hydroxybupropion, no bupropion dose adjustments appear warranted when the drug is administered orally with G. biloba extract, due to the lack of significant change observed in AUC for either bupropion or hydroxybupropion."
2013,24501814,[Medicinal plants in the phytotherapy of alcohol or nicotine addiction. Implication for plants in vitro cultures].,"The increasing problem of nicotine and alcohol addiction, and small availability of drugs in the pharmacologic treatment causes that there are still looking for new drugs that could be used in addiction prevention and relief of withdrawal symptoms. Currently, attention has focused on a number of species possessed above mentioned pharmacological profile that do not occur naturally in moderate climate in Poland, including Passiflora incarnata, Pueraria lobata, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Salvia przewalskii. A rich source of biologically active compounds showing their possible benefit against addiction are plant derived both from its natural state as well as by biotechnological methods. Studies using in vitro plant cultures allow receiving material containing interesting secondary metabolites (active compounds) in the of shoots, root, callus and suspension cultures. Overview of pharmacological studies showed that several experiments carried out in animal models of alcoholism, and only few studies have been done on nicotine addiction using herbs. It has been shown that an extract of the herb Passiflora incarnata (and its benzoflavone derivative-BZF) can be an interesting plant material that could reduce the intensity of nicotine or alcohol withdrawal symptoms, however, only few studies have been published in this area. A larger amount of evidence has been provided to the anti-alcohol effect of the extract from the root of Pueraria lobata (kudzu). It is known that kudzu root extract is effective at reducing alcohol intake in animals and in humans. The three major isoflavones present in kudzu extracts, daidzin, daidzein and puerarin are responsible for the beneficial effects in reduction of alcohol consumption, although the exact mechanism by which kudzu suppresses ethanol intake remains to be clarified. It has been proven that daidzin in vitro is a strong, selective and reversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Moreover, studies on the CNS receptor gene expression showed that the extract of kudzu possibly acts through opioid system and exhibits antagonist activity by influencing the opioid receptors mi, delta and the expression of endogenous opioid precursors (proopiomelanocortin) similarly as naltrexone. Besides kudzu, also pre-clinical data suggest that extracts from Salvia miltiorrhiza and Salvia przewalskii are effective in reducing voluntary alcohol intake in animal models of excessive alcohol drinking and their main active compounds - tanshinones and miltiron are responsible for this effect. In summary, there is a need for further studies on the mechanisms of plant extracts and their active compounds action that are valuable alternative way for the prevention and treatment of various drug dependences."
2008,18344215,Hesperidin in orange juice reduces the absorption of celiprolol in rats.,"It has been reported that the intestinal absorption of celiprolol, an antihypertensive drug, is inhibited when it is taken with orange juice; it has been suggested that element(s) in citrus juice are responsible for this. In the present study, the pharmacokinetic interaction between celiprolol and orange juice was characterized through in vivo experiments with rats. Celiprolol 5 mg/kg was injected into the rat duodenum together with 5 ml/kg of neutralized orange juice or the same concentration of hesperidin as in the orange juice. Plasma celiprolol concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Concomitant administration of orange juice or hesperidin with celiprolol significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 74% and 75%, respectively, compared with control. These findings suggest that hesperidin is responsible for the decreased absorption of celiprolol and that orange juice taken with celiprolol has an inhibiting effect on intestinal absorption of the drug."
2019,30551509,Wild edible onions - Allium flavum and Allium carinatum - successfully prevent adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate potential of two chemically characterized edible wild onion species, Allium flavum and Allium carinatum, to reduce side effects of cytostatic doxorubicin (Dox). Since Dox application is mainly limited due to its high cardiotoxicity, while there are no approved cardioprotective agents for the prevention of Dox adverse effects, new co-treatments are urgently needed. Here, we showed that methanol extracts expressed high antioxidant activity and synergistically increased Dox anticancer activity against human hepatoma (HepG2) and lung carcinoma (A549) cells, while protected normal human fibroblasts (MRC-5) from Dox cytotoxicity. Analysis of the antioxidative enzymes level (catalase and superoxide dismutases) showed that the catalase level was differently altered in cancer cells compared to normal cells upon applied treatments. In vivo toxicity evaluation in the zebrafish model revealed significantly lower toxicity of extracts compared to Dox, and no teratogenic effects at applied doses. We found that extracts successfully rescued the Dox-treated embryos of life-threating cardiomyopathy, while at the same time reduced developmental toxicity and neutropenia. Further analysis demonstrated that extracts had higher anti-angiogenic activity than sunitinib or auranofin, clinically used antiangiogenic drugs. In addition, angiogenesis was markedly more suppressed in Dox-extract cotreatments than upon single treatments."
2017,28049947,Stabilization of Ephedrine Alkaloid Content in Ephedra sinica by Selective Breeding and Stolon Propagation.,"The Ephedra herb, which has been used in Kampo medicines, originates from terrestrial stems of Ephedra species. It is important to establish cultivation methods and cultivars to secure a stable supply of the Ephedra herb that would meet the quality standards for the ephedrine alkaloids content. In this study, we first grew Ephedra sinica plants derived from seeds in the field for 5 years. Then, for selective breeding of cultivars that could meet the quality standards for the ephedrine alkaloids content, we measured the content of total alkaloids (TAs), ephedrine (Eph), and pseudoephedrine (PEph) in individual plants derived from seedlings and grown for 4 years in the field. The range of the TA content in each individual plant was narrower than that among individual plants grown in the field. Therefore, individual plants were selected according to their TA content, Eph/PEph ratio, and stolon-formation capability. The selected individuals were propagated using stolons, and their TA content was studied for 2 years. In the second year, the TA content in terrestrial stems derived from stolons of the selected individuals was as high as that of their parents. Therefore, it was confirmed that the selected individuals that were propagated using stolons could produce TA reproducibly. This study suggested that selective breeding using stolon propagation is effective for stabilizing Ephedra herb TA content."
2015,26455923,Resveratrol prevents insulin resistance caused by short-term elevation of free fatty acids in vivo.,"Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which are commonly found in obesity, induce insulin resistance. FFA activate protein kinases including the proinflammatory IκBα kinase β (IKKβ), leading to serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and impaired insulin signaling. To test whether resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, prevents FFA-induced insulin resistance, we used a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a tracer to assess hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in overnight-fasted Wistar rats infused for 7 h with saline, Intralipid plus 20 U·mL(-1) heparin (IH; triglyceride emulsion that elevates FFA levels in vivo; 5.5 μL·min(-1)) with or without resveratrol (3 mg·kg(-1)·h(-1)), or resveratrol alone. Infusion of IH significantly decreased glucose infusion rate (GIR; P < 0.05) and peripheral glucose utilization (P < 0.05) and increased endogenous glucose production (EGP; P < 0.05) during the clamp compared with saline infusion. Resveratrol co-infusion, however, completely prevented the effects induced by IH infusion: it prevented the decreases in GIR (P < 0.05 vs. IH), peripheral glucose utilization (P < 0.05 vs. IH), and insulin-induced suppression of EGP (P < 0.05 vs. IH). Resveratrol alone had no effect. Furthermore, IH infusion increased serine (307) phosphorylation of IRS-1 in soleus muscle (∼30-fold, P < 0.001), decreased total IRS-1 levels, and decreased IκBα content, consistent with activation of IKKβ. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished by resveratrol (P < 0.05 vs. IH). These results suggest that resveratrol prevents FFA-induced hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and, therefore, may help mitigate the health consequences of obesity. "
1997,9394699,Hormonal implications of the hypocholesterolemic effect of intake of field beans (Vicia faba L.) by young men with hypercholesterolemia.,"This study examined the hypocholesterolemic effect and hormonal changes resulting from 30 d of supplementation with Vicia faba L. (field bean) flour of diets of young men (aged 18-21 y; n = 40) with borderline-high or high serum cholesterol values. All subjects (groups A-D) consumed the same basic diet. Additionally, volunteers in the control group (A) consumed 90 g control flour/d whereas those in the three bean groups received either 90 g cooked field bean flour (groups B and C) or 90 g raw field bean flour (group D) daily. Groups A and B included volunteers with borderline-high cholesterol values [5.2-6.2 mmol total cholesterol/L and 3.4-4.1 mmol low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol/L]. Subjects in groups C and D had high serum cholesterol concentrations (total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol > 4.1 mmol/L). After 30 d, serum glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, total, LDL-cholesterol, and very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol values were significantly lower than initial values in all subjects who consumed diets containing field bean flour (P < or = 0.0001, except for LDL-cholesterol concentrations in group C, for which P < or = 0.0007). Legume intake also resulted in a significant increase (P < or = 0.0001) in glucagon and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. Neither cortisol nor thyroid hormone values changed significantly. The results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effect of field bean intake depends at least partly on a concomitant increase in glucagon and decrease in insulin values. The more marked reduction in triacylglycerol and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations in subjects who consumed raw field beans indicates a coparticipation of their thermolabile components."
2019,30309606,Identification and mechanism evaluation of a novel osteogenesis promoting peptide from Tubulin Alpha-1C chain in Crassostrea gigas.,"Marine shellfish provides a series of biofunctionality account of its high-protein level. In this study, the osteogenic effect of a novel peptide, YRGDVVPK, from Crassostrea gigas protein hydrolysates on preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 proliferation was examined. Synthetic peptide with 100 nM significantly promoted the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells for a treatment of 72 h assayed by MTT method, and which was confirmed by the increase of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The peptide, YRGDVVPK, was docked with integrin α5β1 (PDB ID: 3VI4), which is a surface receptor of MC3T3-E1. The interaction of the peptide with integrin α5β1 (PDB ID: 3VI4) was analyzed by the molecular modeling algorithm of CDOCKER, which showed a more stable combination than the original ligand. The results suggested the novel peptide could promote the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 proliferation probably by activating the signaling pathway of MAPK, which is induced through binding with peptide YRGDVVPK."
1999,10425233,Definition of the mutation responsible for maple syrup urine disease in Poll Shorthorns and genotyping Poll Shorthorns and Poll Herefords for maple syrup urine disease alleles.,"The organisation of the E1alpha subunit of bovine branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase gene was established. c DNA was cloned from Poll Shorthorn x Poll Hereford calves affected with Maple Syrup Urine Disease to identify the mutation responsible for the disease in Poll Shorthorns. Clones containing the c DNA sequences inherited from the Poll Shorthorn sire of the affected calves were identified. Paternal clones were sequenced and a cytidine to thymidine transition was found at nucleotide 1380. The mutation is predicted to substitute leucine in place of a highly conserved proline at codon 372. A polymerase chain reaction procedure was developed for detection of the 1380C-->T mutation in genomic DNA. Three Poll Shorthorn parents of affected calves and three affected Poll Shorthorn x Poll Hereford calves were heterozygous and an affected Poll Shorthorn calf was homozygous for this mutation. An improved polymerase chain reaction procedure was also devised to genotype Poll Herefords for the 248C-->T mutation. The procedures will facilitate disease prevention programs and assist in differential diagnosis of conditions in new-born calves that present with a rapid onset of progressive neurological disease and are characterised histologically by 'status spongiosus'. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive defect reported in humans (Danner and Elsas 1989), and in Poll Hereford (PH) and Poll Shorthorn (PS) calves (Harper et al 1986, Healy et al 1992). The clinical, biochemical and pathological manifestations of the disease are identical in the two breeds of cattle, and are characterised by the rapid onset of progressive neurological disease, leading to death within a few days of birth. The disease is caused by a deficiency of activity of the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKADH). This deficiency leads to elevated concentrations, in blood and tissues, of branched chain alpha-keto acids and their precursors, the branched chain amino acids, valine, leucine and isoleucine. BCKADH consists of four subunits E1alpha, E1beta, E2 and E3 that are encoded by separate genes, and MSUD may result from deficiency of any of the subunits. In PH s, the disease in caused by premature termination of translation, of the E1alpha subunit, that is induced by a cytidine to thymidine transition exon 2 (248C-->T), that converts the glutamine codon -6 to a stop codon (Q-6ST; Zhang et al 1990). We have shown that MSUD -affected PSxPH calves are heterozygous at the PH locus, illustrating molecular heterogeneity exists for bovine MSUD (Healy and Dennis 1994a). The fact that these crossbred calves are affected, indicates the PS, like the PH mutation, resides in the E1alpha subunit."
2006,16819232,Isolation and biomimetic synthesis of anti-inflammatory stilbenolignans from Gnetum cleistostachyum.,"One new stilbenolignan, gnetucleistol F (1), and four known stilbenolignans, gnetofuran A (2), lehmbachol D (3), gnetifolin F (4) and gnetumontanin C (5) were isolated from the lianas of Gnetum cleistostachyum C. Y. CHENG (Gnetaceae). Their structures and relative configurations were determined by means of spectroscopic evidence. Compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 were synthesized for the first time on the basis of their biogenetic pathway, and their possible biomimetical synthetic mechanisms were discussed. The pharmacological activities of all stilbenolignans have been tested. Among them, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 showed moderate inhibitory activities on TNF-alpha and 1 also showed potent inhibitory activity on malondialdehyde."
2002,12400684,Anticoagulant from Taraxacum platycarpum.,"An anticoagulant was purified from a Chinese herb, Taraxacum platycarpum. Its activity was heat-labile, and was decreased by incubation with subtilisin Carlburg or proteinase K, indicating that the active component was a protein. The protein had a molecular mass of 31 kDa by gel filtration and 33 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, so it probably was a monomer. When present at the concentration of 70, 255, and 873 nM, respectively, the protein doubled the thrombin time, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. It inhibited thrombin and kallikrein, but did not hydrolyze fibrinogen. The protein bound the anion-binding exosite of thrombin, competing with the fibrinogen binding site. In addition, the protein caused the murine macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 to produce cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha."
2012,22916808,"In vitro investigations of the potential health benefits of Australian-grown faba beans (Vicia faba L.): chemopreventative capacity and inhibitory effects on the angiotensin-converting enzyme, α-glucosidase and lipase.","The functional properties, including antioxidant and chemopreventative capacities as well as the inhibitory effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase, of three Australian-grown faba bean genotypes (Nura, Rossa and TF(Ic*As)*483/13) were investigated using an array of in vitro assays. Chromatograms of on-line post column derivatisation assay coupled with HPLC revealed the existence of active phenolics (hump) in the coloured genotypes, which was lacking in the white-coloured breeding line, TF(Ic*As)*483/13. Roasting reduced the phenolic content, and diminished antioxidant activity by 10-40 % as measured by the reagent-based assays (diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) in all genotypes. Cell culture-based antioxidant activity assay (cellular antioxidant activity) showed an increase of activity in the coloured genotypes after roasting. Faba bean extracts demonstrated cellular protection ability against H₂O₂-induced DNA damage (assessed using RAW264.7 cells), and inhibited the proliferation of all human cancer cell lines (BL13, AGS, Hep G2 and HT-29) evaluated. However, the effect of faba bean extracts on the non-transformed human cells (CCD-18Co) was negligible. Flow cytometric analyses showed that faba bean extracts successfully induced apoptosis of HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukaemia) cells. The faba bean extracts also exhibited ACE, α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities. Overall, extracts from Nura (buff-coloured) and Rossa (red-coloured) were comparable, while TF(Ic*As)*483/13 (white-coloured) contained the lowest phenolic content and exhibited the least antioxidant and enzyme inhibition activities. These results are important to promote the utilisation of faba beans in human diets for various health benefits."
2011,21946107,Sildenafil improves the beneficial hemodynamic effects exerted by atorvastatin during acute pulmonary thromboembolism.,"We investigated whether atorvastatin has beneficial hemodynamic effects during acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APT) and whether sildenafil improves these effects. We studied the involvement of oxidative stress, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and neutrophil activation. APT was induced with autologous blood clots (500 mg/kg) in anesthetized male lambs pretreated with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously; 1 week) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide 10% subcutaneously). Sildenafil (0.7 mg/kg intravenously) or saline infusions were performed 60 min after APT induction. Non-embolized control animals received saline. APT significantly increased pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) by approximately 310% and 258% respectively. While atorvastatin pretreatment attenuated these increases (~150% and 153%, respectively; P < 0.05), its combination with sildenafil was associated with lower increases in PVRI and MPAP (~32% and 36%, respectively). Gelatin zymography showed increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and increased MMP-9 levels in plasma from embolized animals. Atorvastatin pretreatment attenuated bronchoalveolar lavage MMP-2 increases. The combination of drugs blunted the MMPs increases in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma (P < 0.05). Neutrophils accumulated in bronchoalveolar lavage after APT, and atorvastatin pretreatment combined with sildenafil (but not atorvastatin alone) attenuated this effect (P < 0.05). APT increased lung lipid peroxidation and total protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage, thus indicating oxidative stress and alveolar-capillary barrier damage, respectively. Both increases were attenuated by atorvastatin pretreatment alone or combined with sildenafil (P < 0.05). We conclude that pretreatment with atorvastatin protects against the pulmonary hypertension associated with APT and that sildenafil improves this response. These findings may reflect antioxidant effects and inhibited neutrophils/MMPs activation."
2016,26289003,New trimethyl chitosan-based composite nanoparticles as promising antibacterial agents.,"In the present study, densely dispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were rapidly green synthesized in the presence of Rumex dentatus aqueous extract, followed by UV-irradiation reduction. The Ag NPs were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, and TEM. Then, the Ag NPs were incorporated into interpenetrating polymeric networks based on cationic trimethyl chitosan (TMCS) and anionic poly(acrylamide-co-sodium acrylate) copolymer to develop a new series of composite nanoparticles as potential antibacterial agents. Both TMCS and poly(acrylamide-co-sodium acrylate) were prepared in the study, and characterized using FTIR, DSC, and SEM. The synthesized Ag NPs showed high purity and uniform particle size distribution with particle size ranged between 5 and 30 nm. The composite nanoparticles demonstrated homogeneous spherical shape with size in the range of 378-402 nm. Both Ag NPs and the composite nanoparticles showed promising bactericidal activity as compared with the control. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the composite nanoparticles increased along with increasing the concentrations of Ag NPs and the TMCS. "
2017,28511342,Combination of flavonoids from Oroxylum indicum seed extracts and acarbose improves the inhibition of postprandial blood glucose: In vivo and in vitro study.,"The combined effect of Oroxylum indicum seed extracts (OISE) or major flavonoids from OISE and acarbose on reducing postprandial blood glucose (PBG) levels was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the IC50 values of OISE and baicalein against α-glucosidase were 43.4±0.731μgmL-1 and 25.9±0.412μgmL-1 respectively. A combination of acarbose with OISE or baicalein synergistically inhibited rat intestinal α-glucosidase. The combination index (CI) values for acarbose with OISE ranged from 0.33 to 0.75, suggesting a synergistic but not additive effect. OISE was determined to be a non-competitive inhibitor of maltose-hydrolyzing activity. In vivo, OISE were administered to normoglycemic and diabetic mice, either alone or in combination with acarbose. At doses between 50 and 200mgkg-1, OISE enhanced the efficacy of acarbose by up to 5-fold. These results demonstrated that OISE enhances the efficacy of acarbose in vivo, and that the combination of OISE and acarbose displayed a synergistic effect in vitro. Therefore, OISE can be used to design dietary supplements to treat diabetes."
2015,24925362,Mechanisms of resveratrol-induced changes in cytosolic free calcium ion concentrations and cell viability in OC2 human oral cancer cells.,"Resveratrol is a natural compound that affects cellular calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis and viability in different cells. This study examined the effect of resveratrol on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) and viability in OC2 human oral cancer cells. The Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was used to measure [Ca(2+)]i, and water-soluble tetrazolium-1 was used to measure viability. Resveratrol evoked concentration-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)]i. The response was reduced by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Resveratrol also caused manganese-induced fura-2 fluorescence quench. Resveratrol-evoked Ca(2+) entry was inhibited by nifedipine and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X but was not altered by econazole, SKF96365, and the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate. In Ca(2+)-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished resveratrol-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. Conversely, treatment with resveratrol inhibited BHQ-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 abolished resveratrol-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. At 20-100 μM, resveratrol decreased cell viability, which was not affected by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+)with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining data suggest that resveratrol at 20-40 μM induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Collectively, in OC2 cells, resveratrol induced [Ca(2+)]i rise by evoking PLC-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and by causing Ca(2+) entry via nifedipine-sensitive, PKC-regulated mechanisms. Resveratrol also caused Ca(2+)-independent apoptosis. "
2018,29228824,Development of novel bioadhesive granisetron hydrochloride spanlastic gel and insert for brain targeting and study their effects on rats.,"The aim of this study was to formulate granisetron hydrochloride (GH) spanlastic in mucoadhesive gels and lyophilized inserts for intranasal administration to improve GH bioavailability and brain targeting. Carpapol 934 and HPMC were incorporated in GH spanlastic in nasal gels (GHSpNGs). Gelatin and HPMC as matrix former, glycine as a collapse protecting and mannitol as an insert filler and sweeting agent were used to prepare GH spanlastic loaded in lyophilized inserts (GHSpNIs). The prepared GHSpNGs were characterized for pH measurement, drug content, rheology, and in vitro drug release. The prepared GHSpNIs were characterized for drug content, surface pH, GH release, and mucoadhesion. Biological investigations including pharmacokinetics studies and brain drug targeting efficiency dimensions were performed on rats (LC-MS/MS). The results showed thixotropic pseudoplastic gels and white insert with pH values in a physiological range, drug content (89.9-98.6%), (82.4-98.38%) for gel and insert, respectively and rapid release rate of GH. Biological studies showed that Cmax and AUC0-6 h in brain and plasma after intranasal administration of gel and insert were higher compared to IV administration of GH solution. A high brain targeting efficiency (199.3%, 230%) for gel and insert, respectively and a direct nose to brain transport (49.8%, 56.95%) for gel and insert, respectively confirmed that there is a direct nose to brain transport of GH following nasal administration of GH spanlastic loaded in nasal gel and insert. GHSpNIs can be considered as potential novel drug delivery system intended for brain targeting via the nasal rout of administration than GHSpNGs."
2015,26470793,Effect of Rumex Abyssinicus on preneoplastic lesions in dimethylhydrazine induced colon carcinogenesis in rats.,"Cancer as a multistage process can be reversed or blocked by using chemopreventive agents. Colon cancer chemoprevention has been widely investigated using cyclooxygenase inhibitors and many other chemicals of synthetic or natural origin. This particular study was carried out to assess the colon cancer chemopreventive effect of hydro-methanol extract of Rumex abyssinicus rhizome on rats.Colon cancer chemopreventive potential of hydro-methanol extract of Rumex abyssinicus rhizome was determined based on the number and multiplicity of aberrant crypt foci (ACF). Fifteen DMH (1, 2-dimethylhydrazine) treated and five untreated Wistar female rats were used. DMH was administered subcutaneously 30 mg/kg, after its pH was adjusted to 6.5-7. Treatment groups started receiving extract after six weeks of weekly DMH injections. The rats were divided in to four groups: Group 1 received only oral normal saline, Group 2 received DMH and normal saline, Group 3 and 4 received DMH plus 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg extract, respectively. Specific phytoconstituents of the plant, which were reviewed from original articles, were virtually evaluated for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition. The binding energies and interactions of the phytochemicals from Rumex abyssinicus against COX-2 were determined by Autodock4.2.There was a statistically significant reduction (p-value < 0.05) in the number of aberrant crypt (AC) and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) at both administered doses. However, significant association (p-value > 0.05) was not observed in reducing crypt multiplicity. The docking process resulted in estimated binding energies [-6.83 kcal/mol to -7.9 kcal/mol] which are closer to the positive controls or Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) [-4.55 kcal/mol to -10.84 kcal/mol]. The phytochemical-COX-2 interaction indicated the involvement of key amino acid residues in inhibition of cyclooxygenase like ARG120, TYR355, TYR385, SER530 and GLY526.Rumex abyssinicus had demonstrated a chemopreventive potential at post-initiation stage. As the virtual screening data suggested, COX-2 inhibition by the anthraquinones in the extract could be one mechanism for the observed chemopreventive effect."
2017,27854190,Distribution of the tryptophan pathway-derived defensive secondary metabolites gramine and benzoxazinones in Poaceae.,"The Poaceae is a large taxonomic group consisting of approximately 12,000 species and is classified into 12 subfamilies. Gramine and benzoxazinones (Bxs), which are biosynthesized from the tryptophan pathway, are well-known defensive secondary metabolites in the Poaceae. We analyzed the presence or absence of garamine and Bxs in 64 species in the Poaceae by LC-MS/MS. We found that Hordeum brachyantherum and Hakonechloa macra accumulated gramine, but the presence of gramine was limited to small groups of species. We also detected Bxs in four species in the Pooideae and six species in the Panicoideae. In particular, four species in the Paniceae tribe in Panicoideae accumulaed Bxs, indicating that this tribe is a center of the Bx distribution. Bxs were absent in the subfamilies other than Pooideae and Panicoideae. These findings provide an overview of biased distribution of gramine and Bxs in Poaceae species."
2012,22335772,Antidepressant-like effects of ginsenoside Rg1 are due to activation of the BDNF signalling pathway and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is one of the major bioactive ingredients of Panax ginseng with little toxicity and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. In this study, we investigated the antidepressant-like effect of Rg1 in models of depression in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The effects of Rg1 were assessed in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in mice. Rg1 was also investigated in the chronic mild stress (CMS) mouse model of depression with imipramine as the positive control. Changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and spine density, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling pathway, and serum corticosterone level after chronic stress and Rg1 treatment were then investigated. The tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor and the tyrosine kinase B inhibitor were also used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of Rg1. KEY RESULTS Ginsenoside Rg1 exhibited antidepressant-like activity in the FST and TST in mice without affecting locomotor activity. It was also effective in the CMS model of depression. Furthermore, Rg1 up-regulated the BDNF signalling pathway in the hippocampus and down-regulated serum corticosterone level during the CMS procedure. In addition, Rg1 was able to reverse the decrease in dendritic spine density and hippocampal neurogenesis caused by CMS. However, Rg1 had no discernable effect on the monoaminergic system. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our results provide the first evidence that Rg1 has antidepressant activity via activation of the BDNF signalling pathway and up-regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis."
2010,21046982,"Amelioration of tamoxifen-induced liver injury in rats by grape seed extract, black seed extract and curcumin.","Liver injury was induced in female rats using tamoxifen (TAM). Grape seeds (Vitis vinifera) extract (GSE), black seed (Nigella sativa) extract (NSE), curcumin (CUR) or silymarin (SYL) were orally administered to TAM-intoxicated rats. Liver histopathology of TAM-intoxicated:rats showed pathological changes. TAM-intoxication elicited declines in liver antioxidant enzymes levels (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase), reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSH/GSSG ratio plus the hepatic elevations in lipid peroxides, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and serum liver enzymes; alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and gamma glutamyl transferase levels. Oral intake of NSE, GSE, CUR or SYL to TAM-intoxicated rats, attenuated histopathological changes and corrected all parameters mentioned above. Improvements were prominent in case of NSE (similarly SYL) > CUR > GSE. Data indicated that NSE, GSE or CUR act as free radicals scavengers and protect TAM-induced liver injury in rats."
2014,24315931,Effect of curcumin on diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: possible involvement of opioid system.,"Neuropathic pain is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus. As efficacy and tolerability of current therapy for neuropathic pain are not ideal, we need to develop the novel drug for better treatment. Curcumin as a natural flavonoid from Curcuma longa has considerable effects on nervous system such as, antidepressant, antinociceptive and neuroprotective effects. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of curcumin on diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and possible involvement of opioid system. A single dose of 60mg/kg streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally to induce diabetes in rats. STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated with curcumin (50mg/kg/day) acute and chronically. Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were measured on the days 0, 7, 14 and 21 after diabetes induction as behavioral scores of neuropathic pain. Chronic, but not acute, treatment with curcumin prevents the weight loss and attenuates mechanical allodynia in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Pretreatment with naloxone (1mg/kg) significantly reduced anti-allodynic effect of chronic curcumin in von Frey filament test. Our results suggest that curcumin can be considered as a new therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain and the activation of opioid system may be involved in the antinociceptive effect of curcumin.

2012,22465177,Novel role of Zn(II)-curcumin in enhancing cell proliferation and adjusting proinflammatory cytokine-mediated oxidative damage of ethanol-induced acute gastric ulcers.,"Alcohol consumption can induce gastric ulcers and zinc deficiency. Zinc complexes were reported to have anti-ulcer activity as it acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Zn(II)-curcumin complex and its solid dispersions (SDs) were synthesized and evaluated for its gastroprotective activity and mechanism against ethanol-induced ulcer. The Swiss murine fibroblast cell line (3T3) was used as an alternative in vitro model to evaluate the effects of Zn(II)-curcumin on cell proliferation. Zn(II)-curcumin were administered orally for seven consecutive days prior to induction of ulcers using ethanol. Gross and microscopic lesions, immunological and biochemical parameters were taken into consideration. The results showed that solid dispersions (SDs) of Zn(II)-curcumin (2.5-20 μM) enhanced the proliferation of 3T3 cells more significantly than curcumin at the same concentrations (P<0.01). Oral administration of Zn(II)-curcumin (12, 24 and 48 mg/kg) SDs dose-dependently prevented formation of ulcer lesions induced by ethanol. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and oxidative stress superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX-Px), malonaldehyde (MDA) and H(+)-K(+)-ATPase were in the rats exposed to ethanol in ulceration have been altered. Zn(II)-curcumin prevented formation of ulcer lesions, significantly inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression, increased the activity of SOD and GSH-Px, reduced MDA levels and H(+)-K(+)-ATPase in mucosa of rats compared to controls (P<0.05). These findings suggest that the gastroprotective activity of Zn(II)-curcumin complex might contribute in stimulating cell proliferation and adjusting the proinflammatory cytokine-mediated oxidative damage to the gastric mucosa."
,10667089,Effect of dietary crude proteins on the reproductive function in the postpartum dairy cow.,"The study was conducted on 216 dairy cows. Samples of feeds distributed to cows were collected monthly for the purpose of determining their content in dry matter, energy, crude proteins and mineral matter. Milk samples were collected weekly for every cow from newly calved cows until confirmation of pregnancy by rectal palpation at least 2 months after artificial insemination. These samples were used for progesterone assays in skimmed milk, in order to assess the interval between calving and return to ovarian activity [C-ROA], calving and first insemination [C-I1], calving and conception [C-C] and number of inseminations per conception (nI/C). Results have shown a significant negative correlation between the duration of [C-ROA] and [C-C] intervals and the dietary content in crude proteins (r = -0.720, p < 0.05 and r = -0.914, p < 0.01 respectively)."
2012,22370147,Safety evaluation of vitamin A in growing dogs.,"The safe upper limit for inclusion of vitamin A in complete diets for growing dogs is uncertain, with the result that current recommendations range from 5.24 to 104.80 μmol retinol (5000 to 100 000 IU vitamin A)/4184 kJ (1000 kcal) metabolisable energy (ME). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of feeding four concentrations of vitamin A to puppies from weaning until 1 year of age. A total of forty-nine puppies, of two breeds, Labrador Retriever and Miniature Schnauzer, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Following weaning at 8 weeks of age, puppies were fed a complete food supplemented with retinyl acetate diluted in vegetable oil and fed at 1 ml oil/100 g diet to achieve an intake of 5·24, 13·10, 78·60 and 104·80 μmol retinol (5000, 12 500, 75 000 and 100 000 IU vitamin A)/4184 kJ (1000 kcal) ME. Fasted blood and urine samples were collected at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 26, 36 and 52 weeks of age and analysed for markers of vitamin A metabolism and markers of safety including haematological and biochemical variables, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptides of type I collagen and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Clinical examinations were conducted every 4 weeks. Data were analysed by means of a mixed model analysis with Bonferroni corrections for multiple endpoints. There was no effect of vitamin A concentration on any of the parameters, with the exception of total serum retinyl esters, and no effect of dose on the number, type and duration of adverse events. We therefore propose that 104·80 μmol retinol (100 000 IU vitamin A)/4184 kJ (1000 kcal) is a suitable safe upper limit for use in the formulation of diets designed for puppy growth."
2013,24600729,Drug-related cardiac valve disease.,"Cardiac valve disease can involve one or more of the four heart valves. Chronic valve damage may remain asymptomatic for long periods but ultimately leads to haemodynamic overload of the heart. The most common causes of valve disease are rheumatic diseases, infections, chronic renal failure, malformations, and genetic diseases. Valve disease is often attributed to degeneration with no known cause.The frequency of drug-related valve disease has long been underestimated. Most implicated drugs have serotonergic properties, such as fenfluramine-derived amphetamines, including benfluorex. Rye ergot derivatives can also be implicated: these include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide and cabergoline), migraine treatments (methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), and drugs used for cognitive and neurosensory deficits (nicergoline, dihydroergocryptine, etc.). ""Ecstasy"", an amphetamine, is sometimes also involved. The risk increases after a few months of exposure. Drug withdrawal is sometimes followed by an improvement. Patients exposed to a drug known to cause valve damage should be informed of the risk and receive long-term monitoring to detect these lesions before they become irreversible. The possible role of a drug should always be considered when cardiac valve disease is diagnosed, in order to facilitate active research and to avoid exposing other patients to this risk."
2000,10830515,Effects of soybean saponin on protease hydrolyses of beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin.,Effects of Soybean Saponin on Protease Hydrolyses of beta-Lactoglobulin and alpha-Lactalbumin The effects of soybean saponin on tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolyses of whey proteins were evaluated. beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin became more sensitive to both trypsin and chymotrypsin by interacting with saponin in contrast to serum albumin. Soybean saponin was shown to have different effects on various proteins according to their nature.
1996,8611476,Unrelated donor marrow transplantation for myelodysplasia (MDS) and MDS-related acute myeloid leukaemia.,"Allogeneic marrow transplantation using related marrow donors for myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) arising from MDS results in 35-56% actuarial disease-free survival. Because the use of unrelated donors has not been well-characterized, we report on the outcome of 52 patients with MDS or MDS-related AML consecutively treated between 1987 and 1993 with unrelated donor marrow transplantation. The median age was 33 (range 1-53) years. 33 patients received chemotherapy and total body irradiation and the remainder busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The donors were phenotypically identical at the HLA-A, B and Dw/DRB1 loci in 34 cases and mismatched for one HLA locus in 17 cases and two loci in one case. Marrow was non-T-cell depleted and methotrexate with cyclosporine or FK506 was used for postgrafting immunosuppression. The 2-year disease-free survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality rates were 38%, 28% and 48%, respectively. One patient who relapsed survives disease-free after withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. 16/19 survivors have a performance status of 90-100%. Patients with MDS in transformation or with AML had a significantly higher risk of relapse than patients with less advanced disease (P = 0.0014). Increased non-relapse mortality was significantly associated with higher age, longer disease duration before transplant, lower neutrophil count on admission and, unexpectedly, being seronegative for cytomegalovirus. We conclude that the outcome with transplantation using unrelated donors is similar to reported results using related donors and that a meaningful proportion of eligible patients with an otherwise incurable disease may be cured with this treatment. However, mortality from the transplant procedure is high and future studies should focus on reducing toxicity."
2004,15022722,Inhibitory phlorotannins from the edible brown alga Ecklonia stolonifera on total reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the pathogenesis of many human degenerative diseases such as cancer, aging, arteriosclerosis, and rheumatism. Much attention has been focused on the development of safe and effective antioxidants. To discover sources of antioxidative activity in marine algae, extracts from 17 kinds of seaweed were screened for their inhibitory effect on total ROS generation in kidney homogenate using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). ROS inhibition was seen in three species: Ulva pertusa, Symphyocladia latiuscula, and Ecklonia stolonifera. At a final concentration of 25 microg/mL, U. pertusa inhibited 85.65+/-20.28% of total ROS generation, S. latiscula caused 50.63+/-0.09% inhibitory, and the Ecklonia species was 44.30+/-7.33% inhibition. E. stolonifera Okamura (Laminariaceae), which belongs to the brown algae, has been further investigated because it is commonly used as a foodstuff in Korea. Five compounds, phloroglucinol (1), eckstolonol (2), eckol (3), phlorofucofuroeckol A (4), and dieckol (5), isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of the methanolic extract of E. stolonifera inhibited total ROS generation."
2018,29933048,Agave negatively regulates YAP and TAZ transcriptionally and post-translationally in osteosarcoma cell lines.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most aggressive type of primary solid tumor that develops in bone. Whilst conventional chemotherapy can improve survival rates, the outcome for patients with metastatic or recurrent OS remains poor, so novel treatment agents and strategies are required. Research into new anticancer therapies has paved the way for the utilisation of natural compounds as they are typically less expensive and less toxic compared to conventional chemotherapeutics. Previously published works indicate that Agave exhibits anticancer properties, however potential molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the anticancer effects of Agave leaf extract in OS cells suggesting that Agave inhibits cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration, and can induce apoptosis in OS cell lines. Moreover, Agave sensitizes OS cells to cisplatin (CDDP) and radiation, to overcome chemo- and radio-resistance. We demonstrate that Agave extract induces a marked decrease of Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and Tafazzin (TAZ) mRNA and protein expression upon treatment. We propose an initial mechanism of action in which Agave induces YAP/TAZ protein degradation, followed by a secondary event whereby Agave inhibits YAP/TAZ transcription, effectively deregulating the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65:p50 heterodimers responsible for transcriptional induction of YAP and TAZ."
2008,26050001,Fatty acid composition of seed oil of different Sorghum bicolor varieties.,"In order to find out new sources of premium quality edible oil in the country, seeds of ten varieties of Sorghum bicolor were initially analyzed for their total oil contents. The seed oil was later fractionated into eight fatty acids including two new saturated fatty acids. The oil contents were determined by Soxhlet method and compared with the results obtained by NMR analysis. The total oil contents in the seeds of sorghum ranged from 5.0 to 8.2 % (w/w), indicating non significant difference obtained by two different techniques. The results revealed that oleic acid (31.12-48.99%), Palmitoleic acid (0.43-0.56%), linoleic acids (27.59-50.73%), linolenic acid (1.71-3.89%), stearic acid (1.09-2.59%) and palmitic acid (11.73-20.18%) was present in the seed oil of different sorghum varieties when analyzed by GC-MS. It was observed that in most of the varieties polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were higher than monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The two atypical SFAs, octanedioic (C8:0) and azelaic acid (C9:0) were found in some varieties. These results suggest that these S. bicolor varieties could be additional sources of edible oil due to presence of clinically important saturated and high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids. A large scale production of the seed oil after refining process can contribute towards alleviation of edible oil shortage in the country with increased use of premium quality oil. "
1990,2337286,Effects of inflammation and aqueous tear film deficiency on conjunctival morphology and ocular mucus composition in cats.,"An experimental model of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) was produced by removing the lacrimal gland and the gland of the third eyelid from the left eye of 6 cats. The right eye of each cat was left intact and used as a control. After 2 weeks, cats were euthanatized and the central portion of the upper eyelid from both eyes of each cat was excised. Histologic sections were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or with a battery of biotinylated lectins including concanavalin A (conA), soybean agglutinin (SBA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (S-WGA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), peanut agglutinin (PNA), and PNA pretreated with neuraminidase. Consistent differences in histologic features were not observed between conjunctivas with KCS and control conjunctivas. A variable degree of mononuclear cell infiltration of the substantia propria was observed in control conjunctivas and those with KCS. In both groups, conjunctival goblet cell density decreased and epithelial stratification increased as the degree of submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration increased. Lectin binding sites for DBA, WGA, S-WGA, UEA, PNA, and PNA pretreated with neuraminidase were detected on conjunctival goblet cells of conjunctivas with KCS and control conjunctivas. The mucus/glycocalyx layer of conjunctival epithelial cells in both groups of conjunctivas bound lectins RCA, WGA, UEA, and conA, but inconsistently bound S-WGA. In both groups, DBA principally bound to the mucus layer overlying normal epithelium, whereas PNA pretreated with neuraminidase consistently bound to the mucus layer of stratified epithelial surfaces free of goblet cells. Binding of SBA to goblet cells and the mucus/glycocalyx layer was variable."
2002,12404885,Total synthesis and anti-leishmanial activity of some curcumin analogues.,"Curcumin (1) an important yellow dye isolated from Curcuma longa rhizomes, exhibits a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activity. Ten curcuminoids (2-11) were synthesized by the condensation of 2,4-pentanedione with differently substituted benzaldehydes, using the boron complex approach, which avoided Knoevenagel condensation at C-3 of the diketone. The curcuminoids were assayed in vitro against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes using pentamidine isethionate (CAS 140-64-7) as the reference drug. Compound (5) 1,7-bis-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) was the most effective."
2009,19182379,Protective effect of Tanshinone IIA on the early stage of experimental diabetic nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the leading cause of end stage renal failure, and prevention or retardation of DN has become a major goal in biomedical research. In this study, Tanshinone IIA, a component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, was studied in experimental rats in which DN was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. The DN rats were treated with 10 mg/kg of Tanshinone IIA for 12 weeks to analyze its reno-protective effect with different parameters. Renal hypertrophy and 24-h urinary protein excretion were ameliorated by Tanshinone IIA. Moreover, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), angiotensin II (Ang II), transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), collagen IV, and monocyte/macrophage (ED-1) either in the serum or kidney were significantly reduced. These results suggest that Tanshinone IIA might have protective effects on several pharmacological targets during the progression of DN, and could be a potential drug for the prevention of DN."
2017,28987326,"Synthesis, characterization and biological studies of a cobalt(III) complex of sulfathiazole.","The emergence of old and new antibiotic resistance created in the last decades revealed a substantial medical need for new classes of antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial activity of sulfa drugs is often enhanced by complexation with metal ions, which is in concordance with the well-known importance of metal ions in biological systems. Besides, sulfonamides and its derivatives constitute an important class of drugs, with several types of pharmacological agents possessing antibacterial, anti-carbonic anhydrase, diuretic, hypoglycemic, antithyroid, antiviral and anticancer activities, among others. The purpose of this work has been the obtainment, characterization and determination of biological properties (antibacterial, antifungal, mutagenicity and phytotoxicity) of a new Co(III)-sulfathiazole complex: Costz, besides of its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The reaction between sodium sulfathiazole (Nastz) and cobalt(II) chloride in the presence of H2O2 leads to a brown solid, [CoIII(stz)2OH(H2O)3], (Costz). The structure of this compound has been examined by means of elemental analyses, FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV-Visible spectrometric methods and thermal studies. The Co(III) ion, which exhibits a distorted octahedral environment, could coordinate with the N thiazolic atom of sulfathiazolate. The complex quenched partially the native fluorescence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), suggesting a specific interaction with the protein. The Costz complex showed, in vitro, a moderate antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus. As antibacterial, Costz displayed, in vitro, enhanced activity respective to the ligand against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Costz did not show mutagenic properties with the Ames test. In the Allium cepa test the complex showed cytotoxic properties but not genotoxic ones. These results may be auspicious, however, further biological studies are needed to consider the complex Costz as a possible drug in the future."
2007,17503714,[Androgen deficiency in women: indication and risks of testosterone or DHEA treatment].,"Androgen deficiency syndrome is defined by impaired well being and libido in women with adequate estrogenization and low levels of total serum testosterone (T). The causes of low T levels are discussed. Seven placebo controlled studies have shown that percutaneous administration of T is able to increase sexual activity and libido in ovariectomized women (5 studies), after hypophysectomy and in natural menopause. DHEA (50 mg/d) is beneficial only in women with Addison disease or after hypophysectomy but not in natural adrenopause. Other beneficial and side effects of androgenotherapy are discussed in particular the breast cancer risk."
2013,23553159,An increase in renal dopamine does not stimulate natriuresis after fava bean ingestion.,"Fava beans (Vicia faba) contain dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), and their ingestion may increase dopamine stores. Renal dopamine regulates blood pressure and blood volume via a natriuretic effect.The objective was to determine the relation between dietary fava beans, plasma and urinary catechols, and urinary sodium excretion in 13 healthy volunteers.Catechol and sodium data were compared by using a longitudinal design in which all participants consumed a fixed-sodium study diet on day 1 and the fixed-sodium diet plus fava beans on day 2. Blood was sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after a meal, and 3 consecutive 4-h urine samples were collected.Mean (±SD) plasma dopa was significantly greater 1 h after fava bean consumption (11,670 ± 5440 compared with 1705 ± 530 pg/mL; P = 0.001) and remained elevated at 6 h. Plasma dopamine increased nearly 15-fold during this period. Fava bean consumption also increased urinary dopamine excretion to 306 ± 116, 360 ± 235, and 159 ± 111 μg/4-h urine sample compared with 45 ± 21, 54 ± 29, and 44 ± 17 μg in the 3 consecutive 4-h samples after the control diet (P ≤ 0.005). These substantial increases in plasma and urinary dopa and dopamine were unexpectedly associated with decreased urinary sodium.The failure of fava bean consumption to provoke natriuresis may indicate that dopa concentrations in commercially available beans do not raise renal dopamine sufficiently to stimulate sodium excretion, at least when beans are added to a moderate-sodium diet in healthy volunteers. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01064739."
2016,27022983,Precipitation of sword bean proteins by heating and addition of magnesium chloride in a crude extract.,"Sword bean (Canavalia gladiata) seeds are a traditional food in Asian countries. In this study, we aimed to determine the optimal methods for the precipitation of sword bean proteins useful for the food development. The soaking time for sword beans was determined by comparing it with that for soybeans. Sword bean proteins were extracted from dried seeds in distilled water using novel methods. We found that most proteins could be precipitated by heating the extract at more than 90 °C. Interestingly, adding magnesium chloride to the extract at lower temperatures induced specific precipitation of a single protein with a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa. The molecular weight and N-terminal sequence of the precipitated protein was identical to that of canavalin. These data suggested that canavalin was precipitated by the addition of magnesium chloride to the extract. Our results provide important insights into the production of processed foods from sword bean. "
2005,16314819,[Efficacy of peginterferon plus ribavirin for HIV-HCV co-infection. Results of the APRICOT study].,"Until the publication in 2004 of the Apricot, ACTG 5071, and ANRS Ribavic trials, data about the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and HCV were sparse. The international Apricot study included 868 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients naive of all HCV treatments. They were randomized into 3 groups for 48 weeks of hepatitis C treatment by peginterferon alpha-2a + ribavirin, or peginterferon alpha-2a + placebo, or interferon alpha-2a + ribavirin. Six months after treatment stopped, sustained virologic response (the principal efficacy criterion, intention-to-treat analysis) was observed in 40% of patients treated by peginterferon + ribavirin (29% for the nonresponsive genotype 1, and 62% for genotypes 2 and 3), 20% of those receiving peginterferon + placebo, and 12% of those in the group of nonpegylated interferon + ribavirin. This study also validated the positive and negative predictive values of viral load analyzed at 12 weeks of treatment; it was best for patients in genotypes 2 and 3. The factors associated with the best virologic response were a non-1 genotype and a low HCV viral load (< 800,000 IU/mL). As pointed out in the guidelines of the last European consensus conference on coinfection, the combination of peginterferon + ribavirin is currently the reference treatment for chronic hepatitis C. It should also be the preferred treatment for patients with HIV-HCV coinfection."
2015,25722156,Hydrophilic gallic acid-imprinted polymers over magnetic mesoporous silica microspheres with excellent molecular recognition ability in aqueous fruit juices.,"Hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for gallic acid (GA) were prepared with excellent recognition ability in an aqueous solution. The proposed MIPs were designed by self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) on magnetic mesoporous silica (Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2, MMS) using GA as template. Resulting Fe3O4@SiO2@mSiO2@MIPs (MMS-MIPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and evaluated by adsorption isotherms/kinetics and competitive adsorption. The adsorption behavior between GA and MMS-MIPs followed Langmuir and Sips adsorption isotherms with a maximum adsorption capacity at 88.7 mg/g and pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics with fast binding (equilibrium time at 100 min). In addition, MMS-MIPs showed rapid magnetic separation (10 s) and stability (retained 95.2% after six cycles). Subsequently, MMS-MIPs were applied for the selective extraction and determination of GA from grape, apple, peach and orange juices (4.02, 3.91, 5.97, and 0.67 μg/g, respectively). Generally, the described method may pave the way towards rationally designing more advanced hydrophilic MIPs."
2005,15536203,"Comparative effects of DHEA vs. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol on proliferation and gene expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.","Serum levels of the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) peak in men and women in the third decade of life and decrease progressively with age. Increasing numbers of middle-aged and older individuals consume over-the-counter preparations of DHEA, hoping it will retard aging by increasing muscle and bone mass and strength, decreasing fat, and improving immunologic and neurobehavioral functions. Because DHEA can serve as a precursor to more potent androgens and estrogens, like testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17beta-estradiol (E2), supplemental DHEA use may pose a cancer risk in patients with nascent or occult prostate cancer. The steroid-responsive human LNCaP prostate cancer cells, containing a functional but mutated androgen receptor (AR), were used to compare effects of DHEA with those of T, DHT, and E2 on cell proliferation and protein and/or gene expression of AR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), IGF-I, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins-2, -3, and -5, (IGFBPs-2, -3, and -5), and estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta). Cell proliferation assays revealed significant stimulation by all four steroids. DHEA- and E2-induced responses were similar but delayed and reduced compared with that of T and DHT. All four hormones increased gene and/or protein expression of PSA, IGF-IR, IGF-I, and IGFBP-2 and decreased that of AR, ERbeta, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3. There were no significant effects of hormone treatment on IGFBP-5 mRNA. DHEA and E2 responses were similar, and distinct from those of DHT and T, in time- and dose-dependent studies. Further studies of the mechanisms of DHEA effects on prostate cancer epithelial cells of varying AR status, as well as on prostate stromal cells, will be required to discern the implications of DHEA supplementation on prostatic health."
2016,26879487,Gastrointestinal modifications and bioavailability of brown seaweed phlorotannins and effects on inflammatory markers.,"Brown seaweeds such as Ascophyllum nodosum are a rich source of phlorotannins (oligomers and polymers of phloroglucinol units), a class of polyphenols that are unique to Phaeophyceae. At present, there is no information on the bioavailability of seaweed polyphenols and limited evidence on their bioactivity in vivo. Consequently, we investigated the gastrointestinal modifications in vitro of seaweed phlorotannins from A. nodosum and their bioavailability and effect on inflammatory markers in healthy participants. In vitro, some phlorotannin oligomers were identified after digestion and colonic fermentation. In addition, seven metabolites corresponding to in vitro-absorbed metabolites were identified. Urine and plasma samples contained a variety of metabolites attributed to both unconjugated and conjugated metabolites (glucuronides and/or sulphates). In both urine and plasma, the majority of the metabolites were found in samples collected at late time points (6-24 h), suggesting colonic metabolism of high-molecular-weight phlorotannins, with three phlorotannin oligomers (hydroxytrifuhalol A, 7-hydroxyeckol, C-O-C dimer of phloroglucinol) identified in urine samples. A significant increase of the cytokine IL-8 was also observed. Our study shows for the first time that seaweed phlorotannins are metabolised and absorbed, predominantly in the large intestine, and there is a large inter-individual variation in their metabolic profile. Three phlorotannin oligomers present in the capsule are excreted in urine. Our study is the first investigation of the metabolism and bioavailability of seaweed phlorotannins and the role of colonic biotransformation. In addition, IL-8 is a possible target for phlorotannin bioactivity. "
2013,24200784,The white-rot fungus pleurotus ostreatus transformant overproduced intracellular cAMP and laccase.,Transformation of Pleurotus ostreatus PC9 with the mutated heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit (Gα) gene resulted in higher laccase (Lac) activity and intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations as compared to those in wild-type PC9. The transformant also exhibited higher Lac activity than the wild type when cultured in a medium containing known Lac inducers CuSO4 and ferulic acid. 
2006,16477892,Nonhormonal therapies for hot flashes in menopause.,"Numerous reports in the medical literature and popular media have discussed the effectiveness of various nonhormonal agents in reducing menopausal hot flash symptoms. Data for these therapies are limited, and most of the studies have been conducted in women with a history of breast cancer. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine have been shown to reduce hot flashes by 19 to 60 percent and were well tolerated by study participants. Soy isoflavones reduced hot flashes by 9 to 40 percent in some trials, but most trials showed no difference compared with placebo. Black cohosh and red clover also have had inconsistent results, with some trials showing benefit and some no difference compared with placebo. Soy isoflavones, black cohosh, and red clover were well tolerated in clinical trials. Other agents that have been used to alleviate hot flashes include belladonna/ergotamine tartrate/phenobarbital combination, dong quai, evening primrose oil, gabapentin, ginseng, mirtazapine, trazodone, vitamin E, and wild yam, but few data regarding their effectiveness have been published. Further randomized controlled trials are needed."
2012,21791144,Repeated and long-term treatment with physiological concentrations of resveratrol promotes NO production in vascular endothelial cells.,"In the present study, we examined the effect of repeated and long-term treatment with resveratrol on NO production in endothelial cells as a model of routine wine consumption. Repeated treatment with resveratrol for 5 d resulted in an increase in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein content and NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant increase in functional eNOS protein content was observed with resveratrol, even at 50 nm. In contrast, eNOS phosphorylation was not stimulated and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not detected after resveratrol treatment. Both eNOS protein and mRNA expression were promoted by 50 nm-resveratrol in a time-dependent manner. Increased eNOS mRNA expression in response to resveratrol was not decreased by an oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182780, a PPARα inhibitor MK886 or a sirtuin inhibitor Salermide. However, a combination of ICI182780 and MK886 significantly inhibited resveratrol-induced eNOS mRNA expression. Salermide had no effect even in the presence of ICI182780 or MK886. These results demonstrate that resveratrol within the physiological range increases eNOS mRNA and protein expression through ER and PPARα activation, thereby promoting NO production in endothelial cells. eNOS induction might result from the accumulative effect of nanomolar concentrations of resveratrol. The present study results can account in part for the observation that cardiovascular benefits of red wine are experienced with routine consumption, but not with acute consumption."
2008,18449502,Propolis reverses acetaminophen induced acute hepatorenal alterations: a biochemical and histopathological approach.,"The present study has been conducted to evaluate the curative effect of propolis extract, a honey bee-hive product, against acetaminophen (APAP) induced oxidative stress and dysfunction in liver and kidney. Animals were challenged with APAP (2 g/kg, p.o.) followed by treatment of propolis extract (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) once only after 24 h. Release of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and serum bilirubin were increased, whereas hemoglobin and blood sugar were decreased after APAP administration. Antioxidant status in both the liver and kidney tissues were estimated by determining the glutathione, malondialdehyde content and activities of the CYP enzymes, which showed significant alterations after APAP intoxication. In addition, activities of adenosine triphosphatase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and major cell contents (total protein, glycogen and cholesterol) were also altered due to APAP poisoning. Propolis extract successfully reversed the alterations of these biochemical variables at higher dose. Improvements in hepatorenal histoarchitecture were also consistent with biochemical observations. The results indicated that ethanolic extract of propolis has ability to reverse APAP-induced hepatorenal biochemical and histopathological alterations probably by increasing the antioxidative defense activities due to various phenolic compounds present in it."
2005,15710792,"Ginkgo biloba and acetazolamide prophylaxis for acute mountain sickness: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Acute mountain sickness (AMS) commonly occurs when unacclimatized individuals ascend to altitudes above 2000 m. Acetazolamide and Ginkgo biloba have both been recommended for AMS prophylaxis; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba use. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of acetazolamide vs Ginkgo biloba for AMS prophylaxis.We randomized unacclimatized adults to receive acetazolamide, Ginkgo biloba, or placebo in double-blind fashion and took them to an elevation of 3800 m for 24 hours. We graded AMS symptoms using the Lake Louise Acute Mountain Sickness Scoring System (LLS) and compared the incidence of AMS (defined as LLS score > or =3 and headache).Fifty-seven subjects completed the trial (20 received acetazolamide; 17, Ginkgo biloba, and 20, placebo). The LLS scores were significantly different between groups; the median score of the acetazolamide group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group (P=.01; effect size, 2; and 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 3), unlike that of the Ginkgo biloba group (P=.89; effect size, 0; and 95% CI, -2 to 2). Acute mountain sickness occurred less frequently in the acetazolamide group than in the placebo group (effect size, 30%; 95% CI, 61% to -15%), and the frequency of occurrence was similar between the Ginkgo biloba group and the placebo group (effect size, -5%; 95% CI, -37% to 28%).In this study, prophylactic acetazolamide therapy decreased the symptoms of AMS and trended toward reducing its incidence. We found no evidence of similar efficacy for Ginkgo biloba."
2017,27507475,"Oxyresveratrol and ascorbic acid O/W microemulsion: Preparation, characterization, anti-isomerization and potential application as antibrowning agent on fresh-cut lotus root slices.","The purpose of this study is to prepare an oxyresveratrol (Oxy) microemulsion (ME) with improved Oxy's solubility and stability and to investigate its antibrowning effects on fresh-cut lotus root slices. The formula of OxyME consisted of ethyl butyrate, Tween 80, PEG400, and water with w/w of 4%, 10.67%, 5.33%, and 80%, respectively. Encapsulating Oxy into OxyME greatly increased its solubility and stability compared with that of in water. Strong antibrowning effects were observed on fresh-cut lotus root slices treated with OxyME, even better than 4-hexylresorcinol. The addition of ascorbic acid (VC) into OxyME greatly improved the Oxy stability in long-term storage and antibrowning effects on fresh-cut lotus root slices. However, the simultaneous addition of calcium chloride and VC did not obviously improve the antibrowning effects compared with the addition of VC alone. These results indicated that Oxy+VCME may be suitable as an antibrowning agent for fresh-cut vegetables. "
2011,21736787,A dairy product fermented by lactobacilli cancels the adverse effects of hypochlorhydria induced by a proton pump inhibitor on bone metabolism in growing rats.,"The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria induced by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration and intake of a dairy product fermented by lactobacilli (DFL) on bone metabolism in growing rats. Male rats, aged 3 weeks, were divided into two groups: a control group fed a casein-based diet and a group fed a DFL-based diet. Each group was fed its respective experimental diets for 9 d. At day 5 of the feeding period, each group was divided into two subgroups: one that received a saline injection and one that received a PPI injection. Rats were subcutaneously administered saline or PPI for 5 d. Faecal Ca excretion was determined from day 6 to day 9. At the end of the experiment, plasma and femurs were collected. Administration of PPI significantly decreased bone mineral density (shown by X-ray computerised tomography) and bone strength (shown by a three-point bending test) in the control group. Plasma osteocalcin, type I collagen C-telopeptides, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations were elevated by PPI administration in the control group. Faecal Ca excretion and urinary P excretion in the control group were remarkably increased by PPI administration. On the other hand, these adverse effects of PPI were not observed in the DFL group. These results suggest that hypochlorhydria-induced bone loss may result from high bone turnover induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism due to Ca malabsorption and that DFL intake cancels these adverse effects probably via improving Ca malabsorption in growing rats."
1992,1469614,[Synthesis and antitumor activities of conjugates of mitomycin C-polysaccharide from Tremella fuciformis].,"The conjugates of mitomycin C (MMC) with glucuronoxylomannan (AC) from Tremella fuciformis were synthesized by the use of spacers (glycine, glycylglycine, glycylglycylglycine). In i.p.-i.p. system the antitumor activity of the conjugates (MMC-G-ACP, MMC-GG-ACP, MMC-GGG-ACP) against P388 leukemia in mice was slightly lower than that of MMC by the evaluation of life span, ILS (%). In s.c.-i.p. system the antitumor activity of the conjugates against sarcoma 180 solid tumor in mice was similar to that of MMC, except for MMC-G-ACP. The reduction of the number of leukocytes caused by MMC was suppressed by attaching MMC to AC. The conjugates did not lower the cytotoxicity of MMC against L1210 mouse leukemia cells in vitro. The release rate of MMC from the conjugates in vitro (half time of MMC release: MMC-G-ACP, 8.8 h; MMC-GG-ACP, 3.1 h; MMC-GGG-ACP, 2.9 h) was much faster than that of MMC-dextran, and differed in the length of the spacer. The results would give useful information on macromolecular carriers in drug-delivery system."
2015,25749150,Effect of plantar subcutaneous administration of bergamot essential oil and linalool on formalin-induced nociceptive behavior in mice.,"This study investigated the effect of bergamot essential oil (BEO) or linalool, a major volatile component of BEO, on the nociceptive response to formalin. Plantar subcutaneous injection of BEO or linalool into the ipsilateral hindpaw reduced both the first and late phases of the formalin-induced licking and biting responses in mice. Plantar subcutaneous injection of BEO or linalool into the contralateral hindpaw did not yield an antinociceptive effect, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of BEO or linalool in the formalin test occurred peripherally. Intraperitoneal and plantar subcutaneous injection pretreatment with naloxone hydrochloride, an opioid receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated both BEO- and linalool-induced antinociception. Pretreatment with naloxone methiodide, a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonists, also significantly antagonized the antinociceptive effects of BEO and linalool. Our results provide evidence for the involvement of peripheral opioids in antinociception induced by BEO and linalool. These results suggest that activation of peripheral opioid receptors may play an important role in reducing formalin-induced nociception."
2015,25294016,"A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of siltuximab (anti-IL-6 mAb) and bortezomib versus bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","We compared the safety and efficacy of siltuximab (S), an anti-interleukin-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody, plus bortezomib (B) with placebo (plc) + B in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in a randomized phase 2 study. Siltuximab was given by 6 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. On progression, B was discontinued and high-dose dexamethasone could be added to S/plc. Response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed pre-dexamethasone by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. For the 281 randomized patients, median PFS for S + B and plc + B was 8.0 and 7.6 months (HR 0.869, P = 0.345), overall response rate was 55 versus 47% (P = 0.213), complete response rate was 11 versus 7%, and median overall survival (OS) was 30.8 versus 36.8 months (HR 1.353, P = 0.103). Sustained suppression of C-reactive protein, a marker reflective of inhibition of interleukin-6 activity, was seen with S + B. Siltuximab did not affect B pharmacokinetics. Siltuximab/placebo discontinuation (75 versus 66%), grade ≥3 neutropenia (49 versus 29%), thrombocytopenia (48 versus 34%), and all-grade infections (62 versus 49%) occurred more frequently with S + B. The addition of siltuximab to bortezomib did not appear to improve PFS or OS despite a numerical increase in response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma."
2012,22338073,Early undernutrition induces glucagon resistance and insulin hypersensitivity in the liver of suckling rats.,"Developing brains are vulnerable to nutritional insults. Early undernutrition alters their structure and neurochemistry, inducing long-term pathological effects whose causal pathways are not well defined. During suckling, the brain uses glucose and ketone bodies as substrates. Milk is a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet, and the liver must maintain high rates of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis to address the needs of these substrates. Insulin and glucagon play major roles in this adaptation: throughout suckling, their blood concentrations are low and high, respectively, and the liver maintains low insulin sensitivity and increased glucagon responsiveness. We propose that disturbances in the endocrine profile and available plasma substrates along with undernutrition-related changes in brain cortex capacity for ketone utilization may cause further alterations in some brain functions. We explored this hypothesis in 10-day-old suckling rats whose mothers were severely food restricted from the 14th day of gestation. We measured the plasma/serum concentrations of glucose, ketone body, insulin and glucagon, and hepatic insulin and glucagon responses. Undernutrition led to hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia to 84% (P < 0.001) and 144% (P < 0.001) of control values, respectively. Liver responsiveness to insulin and glucagon became increased and reduced, respectively; intraperitoneal glucagon reduced liver glycogen by 90% (P < 0.01) in control and by 35% (P < 0.05) in restricted. Cortical enzymes of ketone utilization remained unchanged, but their carrier proteins were altered: monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 increased: 73 ± 14, controls; 169 ± 20, undernourished (P < 0.01; densitometric units); MCT2 decreased: 103 ± 3, controls; 37 ± 4, undernourished (P < 0.001; densitometric units). All of these changes, coinciding with the brain growth spurt, may cause some harmful effects associated with early undernutrition."
1995,7486401,Effect of phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine on acute toxic mastitis in dairy cows.,"A double-blinded randomized prospective clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone for treatment of acute toxic mastitis in dairy cows. All cows were treated 4 times at 12-hour intervals by intramammary infusion of gentamicin (150 mg). A total of 45 dairy cows with toxic mastitis were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: group 1 (control), saline solution, IV; group 2, 1 g of flunixin meglumine, IV; or group 3, 4 g of phenylbutazone, IV. Physical examination and udder variables were assessed at initial examination and 24 hours later. Milk production was recorded at regular intervals from 1 week before until 10 weeks after development of mastitis. Rear quarters (34/45) were more commonly affected than front quarters. Thirty-five cows returned to the herd, 9 cows were culled, and 1 cow died. There were no significant differences among treatment groups in the need for further treatment or outcome. Klebsiella spp (18/45) and Escherichia coli (16/45) were the most common pathogens isolated by culture of milk from affected quarters. The overall bacteriologic cure rate on days 7 and 14 was 64 and 75%, respectively. At the time of initial examination, cows of the control group had higher rectal temperature than did cows of the flunixin group. At the examination 24 hours later, the rectal temperature of cows in all treatment groups was lower than the temperature at initial examination; at that time (24 hours), however, there were no significant differences in temperature among the treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2017,28189062,Batch and fixed bed adsorption of levofloxacin on granular activated carbon from date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) stones by KOH chemical activation.,"Granular activated carbon (KAC) was prepared from abundant Phoenix dactylifera L. stones by microwave- assisted KOH activation. The characteristics of KAC were tested by pore analyses, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption behavior of levofloxacin (LEV) antibiotic on KAC with surface area of 817m2/g and pore volume of 0.638cm3/g were analyzed using batch and fixed bed systems. The equilibrium data collected by batch experiments were well fitted with Langmuir compared to Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. The effect of flow rate (0.5-1.5ml/min), bed height (15-25cm), and initial LEV concentration (75-225mg/l) on the behavior of breakthrough curves was explained. The fixed bed analysis showed the better correlation of breakthrough data by both Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. High LEV adsorption capacity of 100.3mg/g was reported on KAC, thus being an efficient adsorbent for antibiotic pollutants to protect ecological systems."
2009,19073162,Resveratrol-mediated chemoprevention of diethylnitrosamine-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis: inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and lethal diseases. In view of the limited treatment and a grave prognosis of liver cancer, preventive control has been emphasized. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in grape skins, peanuts, berries and red wine, has been shown to possess potent growth inhibitory effects against various human cancer cells. Although resveratrol has been found to exhibit chemopreventive actions in experimentally induced skin, breast, colon and esophagus rodent tumors, chemopreventive potential of this dietary constituent has not been explored well against experimental liver cancer. We evaluated the inhibitory effect of resveratrol using a two-stage model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Initiation was performed by a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA, 200 mg/kg), followed by promotion with phenobarbital (0.05%) in drinking water. The rats had free access to food supplemented with resveratrol equivalent to 50, 100 or 300 mg/kg body weight/day. Resveratrol treatment was started 4 weeks prior to the initiation and continued for 20 weeks. Resveratrol dose-dependently reduced the incidence, total number and multiplicity of visible hepatocyte nodules. Mean nodular volume and nodular volume as percentage of liver volume were also inhibited upon resveratrol treatment. Histopathological examination of liver tissue confirmed the protective effect of resveratrol. Immunohistochemical detection of cell proliferation and assay of apoptosis indicated a decrease in cell proliferation and increase of apoptotic cells in the livers of resveratrol-supplemented rats. Resveratrol also induced the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, reduced anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, with a concurrent increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio with respect to DENA control. The present study provides evidence, for the first time, that resveratrol exerts a significant chemopreventive effect on DENA-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Resveratrol-induced apoptogenic signal during rat liver carcinogenesis may be mediated through the downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax expression. Due to a favorable toxicity profile, resveratrol can potentially be developed as a chemopreventive drug against human HCC."
2014,24176364,Preparative separation of conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) from fermented Camellia oleifera Abel cake by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) encapsulation using pH-zone-refining countercurrent chromatography.,"This paper concentrates on the separation of three conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers (trans-9,trans-11 CLA, trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA) by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) encapsulation using countercurrent chromatography from Camellia oleifera Abel cake fermented by lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus sp. LL-ZSDS001. The elution sequence of the CLA isomers, the mixing zones and mechanism of separation are discussed. The separation of 305.9mg of the crude sample yielded three isomeric compounds: 91.3mg of trans-9,trans-11 CLA, 84.1mg of trans-10,cis-12 CLA and 79.7mg of cis-9,trans-11 CLA at high purities of 98%, 94% and 96%, respectively.

2017,28449995,Melatonin in grapes and grape-related foodstuffs: A review.,"A decade has passed since melatonin was first reported in grapes in 2006. During this time, melatonin has not only been found in the berries of most wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars, but also in most grape-related foodstuffs, e.g. wine, grape juice and grape vinegar. In this review, we discuss the melatonin content in grapes and grape-related foodstuffs (especially wine) from previous studies, the physiological function of melatonin in grapes, and the factors contributing to the production of melatonin in grapes and wines. In addition, we identify future research needed to clarify the mechanisms of grape melatonin biosynthesis and regulation, and establish more accurate analysis methods for melatonin in grapes and wines."
2002,11754876,"Inhibition of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin E2 synthesis by gamma-mangostin, a xanthone derivative in mangosteen, in C6 rat glioma cells.","The fruit hull of mangosteen, Garcinia mangostana L., has been used for many years as a medicine for treatment of skin infection, wounds, and diarrhea in Southeast Asia. In the present study, we examined the effect of gamma-mangostin, a tetraoxygenated diprenylated xanthone contained in mangosteen, on arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in C6 rat glioma cells. gamma-Mangostin had a potent inhibitory activity of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release induced by A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore. The inhibition was concentration-dependent, with the IC50 value of about 5 microM. gamma-Mangostin had no inhibitory effect on A23187-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 extracellular signal regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase or on the liberation of [14C]-AA from the cells labeled with [14C]-AA. However, gamma-mangostin concentration-dependently inhibited the conversion of AA to PGE2 in microsomal preparations, showing its possible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). In enzyme assay in vitro, gamma-mangostin inhibited the activities of both constitutive COX (COX-1) and inducible COX (COX-2) in a concentration-dependent manner, with the IC50 values of about 0.8 and 2 microM, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that gamma-mangostin competitively inhibited the activities of both COX-1 and -2. This study is a first demonstration that gamma-mangostin, a xanthone derivative, directly inhibits COX activity."
1994,7973088,Action of zinc on enzymatic digestion and intestinal transport of sugar in the rabbit.,"The aim of the present work was to study whether zinc chloride added to the drinking water of rabbits affected the intestinal absorption of D-galactose and the activity of sucrase in the jejunum. The results showed that zinc decreased D-galactose absorption in the jejunal tissue. The effect appeared to be due mainly to an action on the active transport of the sugar by the mucosal border of the intestinal epithelium, because the zinc seemed not to affect its diffusion across the intestinal epithelium. Zinc was also shown to inhibit the (Na(+)-Ka+)-ATPase activity of the enterocyte, which might explain the inhibition of the Na(+)-dependent transport of D-galactose. Nevertheless, a possible direct action of the zinc ion on the Na(+)-dependent carrier cannot be discounted. Zinc did not alter the activity of sucrase in the jejunum of the rabbit."
2000,10830482,Molecular cloning and heterologous expression of pea seedling copper amine oxidase.,"The cDNA coding for copper amine oxidase has been cloned from etiolated pea seedlings (Pisum sativum). The deduced amino acid sequence, consisting of 674 residues including the signal peptide, agreed well with those reported for the enzymes from a different cultivar of P. sativum and other plant sources, except for several evolutionary replacements located mostly on the molecular surface. A heterologous expression system for the cloned pea enzyme was constructed with the yeast Pichia pastoris, using the AOX1 promoter and the yeast alpha-factor secretion signal. Adding copper to the culture medium increased the secretion of an active, quinone-containing enzyme. Furthermore, the inactive enzyme produced in a copper-deficient medium was activated considerably by subsequent incubation with excess cupric ions. These results strongly suggest that the Tyr-derived redox cofactor, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanylquinone (topa quinone, TPQ), is produced in the plant enzyme by post-translational modification that proceeds through the copper-dependent, self-processing mechanism, as in the enzymes from bacteria and yeast."
2011,25214347,Whey protein-based coatings on frozen Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): Influence of the plasticiser and the moment of coating on quality preservation.,"The effects of different whey protein concentrate coating formulations (with or without glycerol or sorbitol in two proportions) on frozen Atlantic salmon quality parameters were evaluated. The influence of the moment of coating application (before or after freezing) was also studied. The coating application after freezing increased the thaw yield, decreased the drip loss, and modified colour parameters of frozen and thawed fillets, in comparison with application before freezing. The moment of coating also influenced the colour of cooked fish fillets. The type of plasticiser affects the colour of thawed and cooked samples, but not the colour of frozen samples. The protein coatings delayed lipid oxidation of salmon fillets, providing better protection against it than water glazing, and this effect was more pronounced when glycerol instead of sorbitol was used in the coating formulation. WPC+glycerol (1:1) coating was the best for frozen Atlantic salmon protection. The sensory properties of salmon fillets were not modified by the use of this coating. "
1987,2436512,Isoprinosine and levamisole immunomodulation in artificially reared neonatal pigs.,"An experiment was conducted to determine the capability of isoprinosine (ISO) and levamisole (LEV) to augment delayed-type hypersensitivity and lymphocyte blastogenic reactions in artificially reared pigs. Sow-reared pigs (n = 15) were kept with their dams; artificially reared pigs (n = 15) were removed from sows within 2 days after parturition and reared artificially for 21 days. Isoprinosine was administered orally (75 mg/kg/day) from days 0 to 10. Levamisole (2 mg) was injected subcutaneously on days 5 and 10. Control pigs were given distilled water orally from days 0 to 10 and injected subcutaneously with 0.15M NaCl on days 5 and 10. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen were evaluated at week 2. The phytohemagglutinin skin-test responses were evaluated in all pigs at weeks 1 and 3 of the trial. Hematologic values, body weight, and mortality were evaluated each week. The skin-test responses and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses were lower (P less than 0.05) in artificially reared controls when compared with responses in sow-reared pigs. However, ISO and LEV enhanced (P less than 0.05) the responses in the artificially reared pigs to values comparable with those of the sow-reared controls. Body weight was greater (P less than 0.01) in sow-reared pigs than in artificially reared pigs; drug treatment did not influence weight gain. These data indicated that immunopotentiation of the cellular immune responsiveness of artificially reared pigs may be possible with ISO or LEV."
2008,26047443,"The novel trypsin Y from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) - isolation, purification and characterisation.","This report describes the isolation and partial characterization of the novel group III trypsin Y from the pyloric caeca of Atlantic cod. Other Atlantic cod trypsins have been used as food processing aids with good results. Trypsin Y was purified by p-aminobenzamidine affinity chromatography and characterized by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis, as well as by activity measurements towards synthetic substrates. Identification of trypsin Y was done with polyclonal antibodies raised towards the recombinant form of the enzyme and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Trypsin Y is the only group III trypsin isolated from its native source and characterized by biochemical methods. In accordance with the r-trypsin Y, the native enzyme shows dual substrate specificity, i.e. towards trypsin and chymotrypsin specific substrates. This, along with the high cold-adapted character of trypsin Y, may be valuable for its use as a processing aid for sensitive products such as seafood. "
2001,11157345,"Probiotics in foods not containing milk or milk constituents, with special reference to Lactobacillus plantarum 299v.","Lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. Species such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. In food, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy products whereas L. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. A probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in Sweden in 1994. The product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. It contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of L. plantarum 299v/L. The strain L. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. In humans, L. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. It can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. Should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. L. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. The mechanisms involved need to be clarified."
1999,10509757,In vitro and in vivo inhibition of human flavin-containing monooxygenase form 3 (FMO3) in the presence of dietary indoles.,"The effect of consumption of glucosinolate-containing Brussels sprouts on flavin-containing monooxygenase functional activity in humans was investigated in 10 healthy, male, non-smoking volunteers. After a 3-week run-in period, 5 volunteers continued on a glucosinolate-free diet for 3 weeks (control group), and 5 others consumed 300 g of cooked Brussels sprouts per day (sprouts group). Human flavin-containing monooxygenase activity was measured by determining the levels of urinary trimethylamine and trimethylamine N-oxide. In the control group similar trimethylamine to trimethylamine N-oxide ratios were observed, while in the sprouts group the trimethylamine to trimethylamine N-oxide ratios were increased 2.6- to 3.2-fold, and thus flavin-containing monooxygenase functional activity was decreased significantly. To investigate the molecular basis for the in vivo inhibition of functional human flavin-containing monooxygenase activity, in vitro studies were carried out examining the effect of acid condensation products of indole-3-carbinol, anticipated to be formed after transit of Brussels sprouts through the gastrointestinal system, on the prominent cDNA-expressed human flavin-containing monooxygenase form 3 enzymes. Two indole-containing materials were observed to be potent inhibitors of human flavin-containing monooxygenases, having Ki values in the low micromolar range. The results suggested that acid condensation products expected to be formed upon transit of Brussels sprouts materials through the gastrointestinal system were potent competitive inhibitors of human flavin-containing monooxygenase form 3 enzymes. The findings indicate that daily intake of Brussels sprouts may lead to a decrease in human flavin-containing monooxygenase activity, and this may have consequences for metabolism of other xenobiotics or dietary constituents."

2017,28554615,"Utilization of quercetin and quercetin glycosides from onion (Allium cepa L.) solid waste as an antioxidant, urease and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.","This study aimed to determine the flavonol glycosides from onion solid waste (OSW) using HPLC analysis, with antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities. We found considerable amount of quercetin-4'-O-monoglucoside (QMG: 254.85), quercetin-3,4'-O-diglucoside (QDG: 162.34), quercetin (Q: 60.44), and isorhamnetin-3-glucoside (IMG: 23.92) (mg/100g) dry weight (DW) of OSW. For OSW, the methanol and ethanol showed the strongest antioxidant activities, followed by ethyl acetate, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts. Among the flavonols, Q and QDG possessed higher antioxidant activities. OSW and flavonol glycosides displayed significant enzyme inhibitory activity, with IC50 values ranging from 12.5±0.11 to 32.5±0.28 for OSW, 8.2±0.07 to 16.8±0.02 for flavonol glycosides, and 4.2±0.05μg/mL for thiourea (positive control) towards urease; while 15.2±0.8 to 35.8±0.2 (μg/mL) for OSW, 10.5±0.06 to 20.8±0.05 (μg/mL) for flavonol glycosides, and 6.5±0.05μg/mL for allopurinol (positive control) towards xanthine oxidase, respectively. The OSW and flavonol glycosides may thus be considered as potential antioxidant and antigout agents."
2002,12135108,Carbon monoxide as a novel central pyrogenic mediator.,"Carbon monoxide (CO) are produced by heme oxygenase (HO), and HO was detected in hypothalamus. However, the roles of CO produced in hypothalamus was not fully elucidated. So, we tested the effects of CO on body temperature because preoptic-anterior hypothalamus was known as the presumptive primary fever-producing site. CO-saturated aCSF (4 microl, i.c.v.) and hemin (10 microg, i.c.v.) elicited marked febrile response. Pretreatment with indomethacin completely inhibited CO- and hemin-induced fever. Zinc protoporphyrin-IX (10 microg, i.c.v.) or ODQ (50 microg, i.c.v.) partially reduced hemin-induced febrile response. Dibutyryl-cGMP (100 microg, i.c.v.) produced profound febrile response and this febrile response was attenuated by indomethacin. These results indicate that endogenous CO may have a role as a pyrogenic mediator in CNS and CO-mediated pyresis is dependent on prostaglandin production and partially on activation of soluble guanylate cyclase."
1991,1858772,Warfarin skin necrosis: recurrence in the absence of anticoagulant therapy.,"Skin necrosis is a well-known yet rare complication of oral anticoagulant therapy. We report the unusual recurrence of lesions typical of warfarin skin necrosis in the absence of anticoagulant therapy. A 59-year-old woman developed skin necrosis while receiving prophylactic warfarin following the detection of a large left ventricular thrombus. The warfarin was discontinued and the lesions improved. One month later new areas of skin necrosis developed although the patient had received no further warfarin. Progressive congestive heart failure, poor nutrition, and prolonged oral antibiotic therapy preceded the recurrence. Vitamin K deficiency was present on admission. The potential role of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in the pathogenesis of anticoagulant-associated skin necrosis is discussed."
2017,28077129,Hypoglycemic and pancreatic protective effects of Portulaca oleracea extract in alloxan induced diabetic rats.,"Diabetes is a major public health concern. In spite of continuous new drug development to treat diabetes, herbal remedies remain a potential adjunct therapy to maintain better glycemic control while also imparting few side-effects. Portulaca oleracea has been traditionally used to manage several diseases due to the anti-oxidant and anti-atherogenic effects it imparts. To better understand the mechanisms associated with potential protective effect of P. oleracea extract against diabetes, alloxan-induced diabetic rats were used in this study.Forty Wistar rats (male, 7-8-wk-old, 140-160 g) were divided into four groups (n = 10/group): Group I (control), Group II (P. oleracea-treated; gavaged with P. oleracea extract daily [at 250 mg/kg] for 4 weeks), Group III (diabetic control; daily IP injection of alloxan [at 75 mg/kg] for 5 days) and Group IV (P. oleracea-pre-treated diabetic; gavaged with P. oleracea extract daily [at 250 mg/kg] for 4 weeks and then daily IP injection of alloxan [at 75 mg/kg] for 5 days). Body weight, food consumption, blood (serum) levels of glucose, C peptide, Hb A1C, insulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined for all groups.The results indicated that while Hb A1C, serum levels of glucose, TNF-α and IL-6 were all significantly decreased in the P. oleracea-pre-treated diabetic rats, these hosts also had significant increases in C peptide and insulin compared to levels in the counterpart diabetic rats. These results were confirmed by the histopathological assessments which showed marked improvement of the destructive effect on pancreatic islet cells induced by alloxan.P. oleracea extract is a general tissue protective and regeneartive agent, as evidenced by increasing β-cell mass and therefore improved the glucose metabolism. Thus, stimulation of Portulaca oleracea signaling in β- cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes prevention."
2009,19602861,[Sample preprocessing method for residual quinolones in honey using immunoaffinity resin].,"A sample preparation method was developed for determination of quinolones in honey using immunoaffinity resin. For this purpose, an immunoaffinity resin for quinolones was prepared by coupling a quinolone-specific monoclonal antibody to agarose resin. Honey samples diluted with phosphate buffer were reacted with immunoaffinity resin. After the resin was washed, quinolones were eluted with glycine-HCl. Quinolones in the eluate were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. No interfering peak was found on the chromatograms of honey samples. The recoveries of quinolones from samples were over 70% at fortification levels of 20 ng/g (for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) and 10 ng/g (for danofloxacin). The quantification limits of quinolones were 2 ng/g. This sample preprocessing method using immunoaffinity resin was found to be effective and suitable for determining residual quinolones in honey."
2010,20410591,Estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of phloridzin.,"Phloridzin, a phloretin 2'-beta-D-glucoside, belongs to dihydrochalcones and mainly exists in the fruits of Malus pumila Mill., Lithocarpus polystachyus REHD and the root skins, stems, tender leaves and fruits of Malus hupehensis. It has many pharmacological activities, such as regulating blood sugar level and blood pressure, protecting heart, scavenging of oxygen free radicals and antioxidant injuries. Thus, market demand of products containing phloridzin is increasing year by year. Our research results demonstrated that phloridzin is provided with a double directional adjusting function of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. It showed significant effects on the proliferation of estrogen sensitive estrogen receptor (ER) (+)MCF-7 cells in the absence of estrogen. When added with 17beta-estradiol, phloridzin showed antagonism on estradiol-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation, but it did not significantly affect proliferation of estrogen insensitive ER (-)MDA-MB-231 cells. Phloridzin induced beta-galactosidase activity in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Light increase of the uterine weight and serum estradiol content of mouse was observed when the glucoside was administered orally for 7 d. After oral administration, phloridzin was found mainly in the blood and a small part was metabolized to phloretin. Our investigation proved that phloridzin was distributed at the target organ and played the role of phytoestrogen."
2005,15613680,Dehydroepiandrosterone inhibits the amplification of glucocorticoid action in adipose tissue.,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) exerts beneficial effects on blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity in obese rodents and humans, resembling the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligands and opposing those of glucocorticoids; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Glucocorticoids are reactivated locally by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), which is currently considered as a promising target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we show that DHEA causes downregulation of 11beta-HSD1 and dose-dependent reduction of its oxoreductase activity. The effects of DHEA were comparable with those of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone but not additive. Furthermore, DHEA reduced the expression of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which stimulates the oxoreductase activity of 11beta-HSD1. These findings were confirmed in white adipose tissue and in liver from DHEA-treated C57BL/6J mice. Analysis of the transcription factors involved in the DHEA-dependent regulation of 11beta-HSD1 expression revealed a switch in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) expression. C/EBPalpha, a potent activator of 11beta-HSD1 gene transcription, was downregulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in liver and adipose tissue of DHEA-treated mice, whereas C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta, attenuating the effect of C/EBPalpha, were unchanged or elevated. Our results further suggest a protective effect of DHEA on adipose tissue by upregulating PPARalpha and downregulating leptin, thereby contributing to the reduced expression of 11beta-HSD1. In summary, we provide evidence that some of the anti-diabetic effects of DHEA may be caused through inhibition of the local amplification of glucocorticoids by 11beta-HSD1 in adipose tissue."
2015,26021373,Baicalein reduces the occurrence of cirrhotic endotoxemia by reducing intestinal mucosal apoptosis.,"The dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, is known in traditional Chinese medicine as Huang Qin (H. qin), and it has been officially and traditionally used in treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis in China. Baicalein (BA), a flavonoid originally isolated from H. qin, has shown a wide range of biological activities. This study was to evaluate whether baicalein, can reduce the intestinal mucosal cell apoptosis caused by cirrhotic endotoxemia and its possible mechanisms.For this purpose, compound factors modeling was used to establish endotoxemic cirrhotic rat model. Firstly, we evaluated endotoxin, ALT, AST and TBIL levels after the baicalein treatment (20 mg/kg, i.v.). To investigate the mechanism of baicalein effect on apoptosis, TUNEL assay was used to detect intestinal mucosal apoptosis. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression levels of gene Bcl-2 mRNA and Bax mRNA in intestinal mucosal tissues. Caspase-3 activity of intestinal tissue was detected with colorimetric method in our experiments.After treatment with BA, the serum endotoxin concentration, the intestinal mucosal apoptosis rate and the activity of caspase-3 of the baicalein group were significantly lower than that of the model and the glutamine group. The serum ALT, AST and TBIL concentration of the BA group were significantly lower than that of the model group. The body weight of the baicalein group was significantly lower than that of the normal group, but it was higher than that of the model group. Among the treatment groups, the mRNA level of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was the lowest in the model group and the highest in the baicalein group while the mRNA level of pro-apoptotic gene Bax was the lowest in the baicalein group and the highest in the model group.The present results demonstrated that baicalein could reduce the occurrence of cirrhotic endotoxemia partly by reducing intestinal mucosal apoptosis."
1995,7661457,Pharmacokinetics of caffeine in lactating dairy cows.,"Because caffeine is metabolized by the hepatic P-450 cytochrome oxidase system, clearance of caffeine is an excellent quantitative test of hepatic function in human beings. It is currently used in much the same way that creatinine clearance is used to assess renal function. Caffeine clearance was measured in lactating dairy cows initially to determine the suitability of caffeine clearance as an indicator of hepatic function in cattle. Pharmacokinetic variables of caffeine were studied in 6 adult lactating dairy cows after i.v. administration of a single dose of caffeine sodium benzoate (2 mg of caffeine/kg of body weight). Caffeine concentration was analyzed by use of an automated enzyme immunoassay. The lower limit of detection of the assay for caffeine in serum was 0.079 micrograms/ml. Serum caffeine concentration-time curves best fit an open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Harmonic mean elimination half-life was 3.8 (range, 2.6 to 6.9) hours, and total clearance was 0.118 (range, 0.090 to 0.197) L/kg/h. Milk caffeine concentration was similar to serum concentration 1.5 to 24 hours after caffeine administration. Adverse effects were not observed in cows given caffeine."

Alston (Myrtaceae). AuNPs and AgNPs obtained by both the extracts were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). NMR and FTIR spectra indicate that the saccharides and phenolics present in the S. jambos extracts were the major contributors responsible for the synthesis and stabilization of NPs. NPs were also synthesized by chemical methods and were compared for their antiplasmodial potential against chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and resistant (Dd2) strain of Plasmodium falciparum by using 24h schizont maturation assay. AgNPs synthesized by both the extracts showed higher antiplasmodial activity than the rest. Further, NPs synthesized by S. jambos extracts have shown insignificant cytotoxicity against human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and rat skeletal muscle cell line (L6), which proved their biocompatibility."
2017,28530609,Phenolic compounds of the Australian native herb Prostanthera rotundifolia and their biological activities.,"The chemical identity and bioactivities of phenolic components of the Australian native herb Prostanthera rotundifolia were studied. Phenolic compounds were extracted with 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol and purified by liquid chromatography. The antioxidant capacity of the extract and its inhibiting activity against α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase and hyaluronidase were determined. Phenolic compounds were identified by a combination of HPLC-PDA, LC-high resolution MS (LC-HRMS), LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Compared to spearmint, mint bush showed comparable antioxidant capacity, stronger inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase and comparable and lower activity on α-glucosidase and hyaluronidase, respectively. Major compounds identified were verbascoside (48.8%), 4-methoxycinnamic acid (36.4%), p-coumaric acid glucose ester (9.2%) and 1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl sinapate (5.6%), while caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, hesperidin and naringenin were present in trace quantities. 4-Methoxycinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid glucose ester and 1-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl sinapate were identified for the first time in the genus of Prostanthera."
2015,26196076,(-)Epigallocatechin-3-gallate prevents the reserpine-induced impairment of short-term social memory in rats.,"Reserpine has been confirmed to induce cognitive dysfunction and increase brain neural oxidative stress. Green tea catechins, particularly (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have strong antioxidative properties and can protect against numerous oxidative damages. In this study, we examined the possible protective effects of EGCG on reserpine-induced impairment of short-term memory in rats. Reserpine (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal)-induced memory impairment was assessed using the social recognition task method; locomotor activity and the olfactory discrimination ability were not altered as measured by an open-field test and an olfactory discrimination test, respectively. EGCG treatment (100 and 300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, for 7 days, starting 6 days before the reserpine injection) could improve the worsened social memory of reserpine-treated rats. Also, EGCG treatment reduced reserpine-induced lipid peroxidation and enhanced the antioxidation power in the hippocampi of reserpine-treated rats. These results suggest a protective effect of EGCG in treating reserpine-induced impairment of memory, most probably through its powerful antioxidative activities. Accordingly, EGCG may hold a clinically relevant value in preventing reserpine-induced cognitive dysfunction."
2017,28674047,Subinhibitory Concentrations of Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole Prevent Biofilm Formation by Acinetobacter baumannii through Inhibition of Csu Pilus Expression.,"Acinetobacter baumannii is emerging as a multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen of increasing threat to human health worldwide. Pili are important bacterial virulence factors, playing a role in attachment to host cells and biofilm formation. The Csu pilus, which is assembled via the chaperone-usher secretion system, has been studied in A. baumannii ATCC 19606. Here we show that, in opposition to previous reports, the common laboratory strain ATCC 17978 produces Csu pili. We found that, although ATCC 17978 was resistant to sulfamethoxazole (Smx) and trimethoprim (Tmp), subinhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics abolished the expression of Csu and consequently produced a dramatic reduction in biofilm formation by ATCC 17978. Smx and Tmp acted synergistically to inhibit the enzymatic systems involved in the bacterial synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is required for the synthesis of nucleotides. The effects of these antibiotics were partially relieved by exogenous THF addition, indicating that Smx and Tmp turn off Csu assembly by inducing folate stress. We propose that, for Acinetobacter, nanomolar concentrations of Smx and Tmp represent a ""danger signal."" In response to this signal, Csu expression is repressed, allowing biofilm dispersal and escape from potentially inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. The roles of antibiotics as signaling molecules are being increasingly acknowledged, with clear implications for both the treatment of bacterial diseases and the understanding of complex microbial interactions in the environment."
2015,25977015,"Harvest date affects aronia juice polyphenols, sugars, and antioxidant activity, but not anthocyanin stability.","The goal of this work was to characterize how the date of harvest of 'Viking' aronia berry impacts juice pigmentation, sugars, and antioxidant activity. Aronia juice anthocyanins doubled at the fifth week of the harvest, and then decreased. Juice hydroxycinnamic acids decreased 33% from the first week, while proanthocyanidins increased 64%. Juice fructose and glucose plateaued at the fourth week, but sorbitol increased 40% to the seventh harvest week. Aronia juice pigment density increased due to anthocyanin concentration, and polyphenol copigmentation did not significantly affect juice pigmentation. Anthocyanin stability at pH 4.5 was similar between weeks. However, addition of quercetin, sorbitol, and chlorogenic acid to aronia anthocyanins inhibited pH-induced loss of color. Sorbitol and citric acid may be partially responsible for weekly variation in antioxidant activity, as addition of these agents inhibited DPPH scavenging 13-30%. Thus, aronia polyphenol and non-polyphenol components contribute to its colorant and antioxidant functionality. "
2013,23561150,Tenderization effect of soy sauce on beef M. biceps femoris.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the tenderization effect of soy sauce on beef M. biceps femoris (BF). Five marinades were prepared with 4% (w/v) sodium chloride and 25% (w/v) soy sauce solutions (4% salt concentration) and mixed with the ratios of 100:0 (S0, pH 6.52), 75:25 (S25, 5.40) 50:50 (S50, 5.24), 25:75 (S75, 5.05), and 0:100 (S100, 4.85), respectively. The BF samples which were obtained from Hanwoo cows at 48 h postmortem (n=24) were marinated with five marinades for 72 h at 4°C (1:4 w/w), and the effects of soy sauce on tenderness were evaluated. Soy sauce marination resulted in a decrease in the pH value of the BF sample. However, there were no significant differences in the water holding capacity (P<0.05). The S100 treatment showed the significant (P<0.05) increase in collagen solubility and myofibrillar fragmentation index, contributing to decreased shear force compared to S0 (control). Reduction in intensity of few myofibrillar protein bands were observed for S100 treatment compared to control using SDS-PAGE. Scanning electron microscopy revealed breakdown of connective tissue surrounding muscle fibers of the S100 treatment. The tenderization effect of soy sauce may attribute various mechanisms such as increased collagen solubility or proteolysis which depend on soy sauce level in marinade."
2018,29870054,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Curcumin in regulating anti-inflammatory and epigenetic gene expression.,"Chronic inflammation is a key driver of cancer development. Nitrite levels, which are regulated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), play a critical role in inflammation. While the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin, a natural product present in the roots of Curcuma longa have been studied widely, the acute pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of curcumin in suppressing pro-inflammatory markers and epigenetic modulators remain unclear. This study evaluated the PK and PD of curcumin-induced suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation in rat lymphocytes. LPS was administered intravenously either alone or with curcumin to female Sprague-Dawley rats. Plasma samples were analysed for curcumin concentration and mRNA expression was quantified in lymphocytes. The relative gene expression of several inflammatory and epigenetic modulators was analysed. To investigate the relationship between curcumin concentration and iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 gene expression, PK/PD modeling using Jusko's indirect response model (IDR) integrating transit compartments (TC) describing the delayed response was conducted. The concentration-time profile of curcumin exhibited a bi-exponential decline, which was well described by a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. Importantly the results demonstrate that LPS induced gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers in lymphocytes, with peak expression at approximately 3 h and curcumin suppressed the gene expression in animals administered with LPS. These effects were well captured using the IDR model and an IDR model with the transit compartments. In summary, the PK/PD modeling approach could potentially provide a robust quantitative framework for evaluating the acute anti-inflammatory and epigenetic effects of curcumin in future clinical trials."
2009,19571388,Hepatoprotective effect of syringic acid and vanillic acid on concanavalin a-induced liver injury.,"The edible mushroom Lentinula edodes (shiitake) contains many bioactive compounds. In the present study, we cultivated L. edodes mycelia in solid medium and examined the hot-water extract (L.E.M.) for its suppressive effect on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced liver injury in mice. ConA injection into the tail vein caused a great increase in the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The intraperitoneal administration of L.E.M. significantly decreased the levels of the transaminases. L.E.M. contains many bioactive substances, including polysaccharides and glucan, which could be immunomodulators. Since ConA-induced liver injury is caused by the activation of T cells, immunomodulating substances might be responsible for the suppressive effect of L.E.M. L.E.M. also contains phenolic compounds that are produced from lignocellulose by mycelia-derived enzymes. The major phenolics in L.E.M., syringic acid and vanillic acid, were intraperitoneally injected into mice shortly before the ConA treatment. Similar to L.E.M., the administration of syringic acid or vanillic acid significantly decreased the transaminase activity and suppressed the disorganization of the hepatic sinusoids. In addition, the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and interleukin (IL)-6 in the serum increased rapidly, within 3 h of the ConA administration, but the administration of syringic acid or vanillic acid significantly suppressed the cytokine levels. Together, these findings indicate that the phenolic compounds in L.E.M. are hepatoprotective through their suppression of immune-mediated liver inflammation."
2014,25345748,Effect of maternal supplementation with seaweed extracts on growth performance and aspects of gastrointestinal health of newly weaned piglets after challenge with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88.,"In the present study, a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal supplementation with seaweed extracts ( - SWE v. +SWE, n 20) from day 83 of gestation until weaning (day 28) on post-weaning (PW) growth performance, faecal score, faecal enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) toxin quantification, intestinal histology and cytokine mRNA of unchallenged and ETEC-challenged pigs. Pigs were ETEC challenged on day 9 PW. There was a maternal treatment × challenge (SWE × ETEC) interaction effect on growth performance and faecal score (P< 0.05). Pigs from SWE-supplemented sows and ETEC-challenged (SE) had higher average daily gain (ADG) during 0-13 d PW and reduced faecal score during 0-72 h post-challenge than those from basal-fed sows and ETEC-challenged (BE) (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference between unchallenged pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows (SC) and basal-fed sows (BC) (P>0.10). Pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows had reduced heat-labile enterotoxin gene copy numbers than those from the basal-fed sows (P< 0.05). Maternal SWE supplementation increased the villus height in the ileum of pigs (P< 0.05). There was a SWE × ETEC interaction effect (P< 0.05) on IL-6 mRNA and a SWE × gastrointestinal (GI) region interaction effect (P< 0.05) on transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and TNF-α mRNA. IL-6 mRNA was down-regulated in SC pigs than BC pigs (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference in IL-6 mRNA between SE and BE pigs. The mRNA of TGF-β1 and TNF-α was down-regulated in the colon of pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows compared with those from the basal-fed sows (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference in TGF-β1 and TNF-α mRNA in the ileum between the pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows and basal-fed sows. In conclusion, maternal SWE supplementation improves ADG and the aspects of GI health of weaned pigs following an ETEC challenge."
2014,24423548,Formulating blackberry leaf mixtures for preparation of infusions with plant derived sources of sweeteners.,"Herbal mixtures composed of blackberry leaf and natural sweeteners (dried apples, prunes, figs, raisins, apricots, carrot and sweet potato, stevia leaves and liquorice root) were developed. Their nutritive and bioactive profile, biological activity and sensory properties were determined. Formulated mixtures exhibited lower total polyphenol content (259.09-350.00 mg GAE/L) when compared to plain blackberry leaf, but contained higher content of chlorogenic, ferulic, p-coumaric, rosmarinic acids and quercetin, as well as some macroelements (Ca, K, Mg) and microelements (Ba, Na). Stevia addition to formulated mixtures ensured higher polyphenolic content. Dried carrot exhibited the highest (0.988 g/g) and liquorice the lowest (0.087 g/g) content of total sugars but it contributed to the sweetness with 574.48 mg/L of glycyrrhizic acid derivatives. Plain blackberry leaf extract exhibited cytotoxic and antioxidative activity on human colon cancer cells. Formulated mixtures exhibited improved flavour profile and balanced sweetness in relation to plain blackberry leaf infusion."
2017,28258037,"The role of zinc deficiency-induced changes in the phospholipid-protein balance of blood serum in animal depression model by Raman, FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy.","Depression is a serious mental illness. To study the mechanisms of diseases and search for new, more effective therapies, animal models are used. Unfortunately, none of the available models does reflect all symptoms of depression. Zinc deficiency is proposed as a new animal model of depression. However, it has not been yet validated in a detailed manner. Recently, spectroscopic techniques are increasingly being used both in clinical and preclinical studies. Here we examined the effect of zinc deficiency and amitryptyline treatment on the phospholipid - protein balance in the blood serum of rats using Raman, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and UV-vis technique. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a zinc ample diet (ZnA, 50mg Zn/kg) or a zinc deficient diet (ZnD, 3mg Zn/kg) for 4 weeks. Then amitriptyline administration (AMI, 10mg/kg, i.p.) was started. After injecting the drug for 2-weeks, blood samples were collected and analyzed. It was found that zinc deficiency decreases both the level of phospholipids and proteins and also causes structural changes in their structures. In the ZnD group amitriptyline treatment influenced the protein level and structure. UV-vis spectroscopy combined with the second derivative calculated from the FTIR spectra provided information that the proteins in blood serum of rat fed with a low Zn diet regain their intact structure after amitriptyline medication. Simultaneously, the antidepressant therapy did not have any effect on the level of phospholipids in this group of rats. Additionally, our results show, that amitriptyline administration can change the structure of phospholipids in rats subjected to zinc ample diet. This altered structure of phospholipids was identified as shortening of carbon chains. Our findings indicate that the decreased level of zinc may be the cause of depressive disorders, as it leads to changes in the phospholipid-protein balance necessary for the proper functioning of the body. This study also shows possible new applications of spectroscopic techniques in the diagnosis of affective disorders, and maybe even identifies markers of depressive disorders."
2005,17877128,[Evaluation of the influence of sex hormones on homocysteine concentration in pre- and postmenopausal women].,"The aim of study was to evaluate the influence of sex hormones: estradiol (E), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA-S) and cortisol (F) on the serum homocysteine concentration (HCY) in 40 premenopausal (group M) and 80 postmenopausal (group K) women. The influence of E2 therapy (ET) on the serum HCY level in the women with surgical menopause was also estimated. The plasma HCY concentration in the group M was significantly higher that in group K. After ET serum HCY level decreased significantly. No correlations were found between serum HCY and E2 concentrations in the all groups. No correlations were observed between HCY and FSH, P, T and F concentrations in pre-and postmenopausal groups. There was a significant negative correlation between serum HCY and DHEA-S concentration in group K. This result may indicate, that high level of DHEA decreases HCY concentration. There was no correlation in group M, where the mean concentration of DHEA was lower than in group K. The results of study indicate, that menopause increases and ET decreases plasma HCY concentration. DHEA-S may inhibit plasma HCY concentration in premenopausal women. More studies are needed to elucidate these hypotheses."
2015,24993184,Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in rat and human liver microsomes associate with the metabolism of total coumarins in Fructus Cnidii.,"Fructus Cnidii (Cnidium) is isolated from the dry and ripe fruit of Cnidium monnier (L.) Cuss (umbelifera), an annual herb. It is demonstrated that the active constituents of Fructus Cnidii are coumarins, known as Total Coumarins of Cnidium Monnier (TCCM). Osthole (Ost) and imperatorin (Imp) are the most active constituents of TCCM which are usually regarded as the quality indicators of medicinal Fructus Cnidii. The aim is to study the metabolism of Fructus Cnidii effective monomer osthole and imperatorin in vitro by liver microsomes. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, CYP2D6 inhibitor qunidine, CYP2C8 inhibitor trimethoprim, CYP2C9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole, and CYP1A2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone were used to investigate the metabolism from incubation time, substrate concentration and liver microsomal concentration, respectively. The concentration of liver microsomes was 0.2 mg/ml. Ost (0.8/3.2/12.8 uM) was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min while Imp (1.6/6.4/19.2 uM) was incubated for 30 min. Qunidine, trimethoprim and α-naphthoflavone could significantly inhibit the disappearance of Imp; meanwhile ketoconazole, sulfaphenazole and qunidine could inhibit the disappearance of Ost. CYP1A, CYP2C are involved in the metabolism of Imp and CYP3A mediates the metabolism of Ost in rat liver microsomes. In human liver microsomes, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of Imp; CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of Ost at all the tested concentrations of Ost, while CYP2C9, CYP2D6 mediate the metabolism at high concentration of Ost.

2011,25212150,"Melatonin contents in mulberry (Morus spp.) leaves: Effects of sample preparation, cultivar, leaf age and tea processing.","The effects of sample preparation, cultivar, leaf age and tea processing on melatonin content of mulberry (Morus spp.) leaves were investigated. Sample preparation using ultrasonic technique in combination with solid phase extraction resulted in high recovery rate (76%), when compared to homogenisation in combination with liquid-liquid extraction procedure (12% recovery rate). The melatonin contents in mulberry leaves harvested from three major cultivars (Buriram 60, Sakonnakhon and Khunphai) grown in Thailand were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with fluorescence detector. The average melatonin content of the mulberry leaves cv. Buriram 60 (279.6ng/g dry weight (DW)) was higher than those of cv. Sakonnakhon (100.5ng/g DW) and cv. Khunphai (40.7ng/g DW). The melatonin contents of all cultivars tested were highest in the tip of the leaves, followed by that in the young leaves, whereas the lowest was found in the old leaves. The melatonin contents of the two types of tea produced from mulberry leaves cv. Buriram 60 were also determined. Heat treatment during tea processing decreased the melatonin content in mulberry leaves cv. Buriram 60 by approximately 87%, when compared to that of the fresh leaves. However, there were no significant differences between the melatonin contents of the mulberry leaf tea produced with blanching (mulberry green tea) and those produced without blanching (mulberry black tea).

2017,27693298,"Preparation, characterization and in-vivo evaluation of microemulsions containing tamoxifen citrate anti-cancer drug.","The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize a new nanocarrier for oral delivery of tamoxifen citrate (TMC) as a lipophilic oral administrated drug. This drug has low oral bioavailability due to its low aqueous solubility. To enhance the solubility of this drug, the microemulsion system was applied in form of oil-in-water. Sesame oil and Tween 80 were used as drug solvent oil and surfactant, respectively. Two different formulations were prepared for this purpose. The first formulation contained edible glycerin as co-surfactant and the second formulation contained Span 80 as a mixed surfactant. The results of characterization showed that the mean droplet size of drug-free samples was in the range of 16.64-64.62nm with a PDI value of <0.5. In a period of 6months after the preparation of samples, no phase sedimentation was observed, which confirmed the high stability of samples. TMC with a mass ratio of 1% was loaded in the selected samples. No significant size enlargement and drug precipitation were observed 6months after drug loading. In addition, the drug release profile at experimental environments in buffers with pH=7.4 and 5.5 showed that in the first 24h, 85.79 and 100% of the drug were released through the first formulation and 76.63 and 66.42% through the second formulation, respectively. The in-vivo results in BALB/c female mice showed that taking microemulsion form of drug caused a significant reduction in the growth rate of cancerous tumor and weight loss of the mice compared to the consumption of commercial drug tablets. The results confirmed that the new formulation of TMC could be useful for breast cancer treatment."
2014,25380621,Effect of Nigella sativa on immune response in treadmill exercised rat.,"In the present study the effect of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) ethanolic extract on cytokine profile in control, moderate and overtrained heavy exercised rat was examined.Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control sedentary (C), moderate trained (MT), (V = 20 m/min, 30 min/day, 6 days a week, for 8 weeks), overtrained (OT) (V = 25 m/min, 60 min/day, 6 days a week, for 11 weeks), control sedentary + N. sativa (NC), moderate trained + N. sativa (NM) and overtrained + N. sativa (NO). Immediately and 24 h after the last bout of exercise blood samples were obtained. The serum concentrations of TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-4 and IFNγ were measured by ELISA method.Immediately after exercise the following findings were observed; IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα concentration increased in OT and NC groups but Just IL-6 in MT groups compared with control (P< 0.05-P< 0.001). Serum level of IL-4 decreased in MT and NC (P< 0.05-P< 0.001) but IFNγ increased (P< 0.05) just in MT group vs control. In addition, circulatory levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-4 were higher in OT and NM groups but the IFNγ concentration was lower in the OT group than the MT group (P< 0.05-P< 0.01). The IFN-γ/IL4 ratio was significantly increased in MT and NC (P< 0.05-P< 0.01) while it decreased in OT group. There were not statistical differences in TNFα, IL-6, and IFNγ levels between different time intervals after exercise in all groups.Chronic administration of N. sativa may change pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines profiles. Also it may act as a balancing factor on Th1/Th2 lymphocytes in different exercise loads and act as an inhibitory factor on Th2 phenotype in control animals."
2013,23456691,Determination of plasma dibasic amino acids following trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacyl derivatization using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.,"A rapid analytical method was developed to quantify dibasic amino acids (ornithine, lysine and arginine) after two-step derivatization procedure with good sensitivity and specificity on human plasma. If early diagnosis has not been made, patients with inborn metabolic disorders such as HHH syndrome, Hyperornithinemia and dibasic aminoaciduria rapidly progress to sudden death, physical defect or mental retardation resulting in storage of the toxic material into the brain. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the analytical method for rapid screening and/or correct confirmation diagnosis. The formation of trimethylsilyl derivative of the carboxylic (COO-) functional group was performed by adding MSTFA. Five μL of methyl orange was added to the residue until the color changed into yellow. Consecutively, the trifluoroacyl derivative of the amino (-NH2) functional group was produced by adding MBTFA. Specific ions was chosen for quantification with following ions; m/z 166 and m/z 212 for ornithine, m/z 180 and m/z 395 for lysine, and m/z 292 and, m/z 519 for arginine. A calibration curve showed a linear relationship for the dibasic amino acids spiked to pooled normal plasma showing R(2) of 0.9955-0.9979 in the range of 0.1-600 ng investigated. The utility of the method for screening and diagnosis was demonstrated by recovery 80-125 % and reproducibility with RSD (9-17 %) at low, medium and high concentration fortified to pooled plasma. Collectively, the present study suggest that this method could be useful for diagnosis, screening, therapeutic monitoring of metabolic disorders on dietary therapy with excellent sensitivity and rapidity."
2019,31152699,Capsaicin inhibits the function of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and rat hippocampal neurons.,"Capsaicin is a naturally occurring alkaloid derived from Chili peppers fruits. Using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique in Xenopus oocyte expression system, actions of capsaicin on the functional properties of α7 subunit of the human nicotinic acetylcholine (α7 nACh) receptor were investigated. Ion currents activated by ACh (100 μM) were reversibly inhibited with an IC50 value of 8.6 μM. Inhibitory actions of capsaicin was independent of membrane potential. Furthermore, Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels expressed endogenously in oocytes were not involved in inhibitory actions of capsaicin. In addition, increasing the ACh concentrations could not reverse the inhibitory effects of capsaicin. Importantly, specific binding of [125I] α-bungarotoxin remained unaltered by capsaicin suggesting that its effect is noncompetitive. Whole cell patch-clamp technique was performed in CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons of rat hippocampal slices. Ion currents induced by choline, a selective-agonist of α7-receptor, were reversibly inhibited by 10 min bath application of capsaicin (10 μM). Collectively, results of our investigation indicate that the function of the α7-nACh receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in hippocampal interneurons are inhibited by capsaicin."
2007,17391562,The effects of maternal and infant vitamin A supplementation on vitamin A status: a randomised trial in Kenya.,"Postpartum vitamin A supplementation of mothers and infants is recommended, but the efficacy has been questioned. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Kenyan mother-infant pairs were randomised to maternal vitamin A (400,000 IU) or placebo <24 h postpartum, and infant vitamin A (100,000 IU) or placebo at 14 weeks. Milk retinol was determined at weeks 4, 14 and 26, and maternal and infant serum retinol at weeks 14 and 26. Infant retinol stores were assessed at week 26, using a modified relative dose response (MRDR) test. Among 564 women, serum retinol at 36 weeks gestation was 0.81 (SD 0.21) micromol/l, and 33.3% were<0.7 micromol/l. Maternal serum retinol was not different between groups, but milk retinol was higher in the vitamin A group: (0.67 v. 0.60 micromol/l; 0.52 v. 0.44 micromol/l; 0.50 v. 0.44 micromol/l at 4, 14 and 26 weeks, respectively). When expressed per gram fat, milk retinol was higher in the vitamin A group only at 4 weeks. Infant serum retinol was not different between groups. However, although most infants had deficient vitamin A stores (MRDR>0.06%) at 26 weeks, vitamin A to infants, but not mothers, resulted in a lower proportion of infants with deficient vitamin A stores (69 v. 78 %). High-dose postpartum vitamin A supplementation failed to increase serum retinol and infant stores, despite modest effects on milk retinol. Infant supplementation, however, increased stores. There is a need for a better understanding of factors affecting absorption and metabolism of vitamin A."
1996,8866829,Indole-3-carbinol and diindolylmethane as aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor agonists and antagonists in T47D human breast cancer cells.,"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a major component of Brassica vegetables, and diindolylmethane (DIM) is the major acid-catalyzed condensation product derived from I3C. Both compounds competitively bind to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor with relatively low affinity. In Ah-responsive T47D human breast cancer cells, I3C and DIM did not induce significantly CYP1A1-dependent ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity or CYP1A1 mRNA levels at concentrations as high as 125 or 31 microM, respectively. A 1 nM concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induced EROD activity in these cells, and cotreatment with TCDD plus different concentrations of I3C (1-125 microM) or DIM (1-31 microM) resulted in a > 90% decrease in the induced response at the highest concentration of I3C or DIM. I3C or DIM also partially inhibited (< 50%) induction of CYP1A1 mRNA levels by TCDD and reporter gene activity, using an Ah-responsive plasmid construct in transient transfection assays. In T47D cells cotreated with 5 nM [3H]TCDD alone or in combination with 250 microM I3C or 31 microM DIM, there was a 37 and 73% decrease, respectively, in formation of the nuclear Ah receptor. The more effective inhibition of induced EROD activity by I3C and DIM was due to in vitro inhibition of enzyme activity. Thus, both I3C and DIM are partial Ah receptor antagonists in the T47D human breast cancer cell line."
2004,15467907,Expression of transcription factor Oct-4 and other embryonic genes in CD133 positive cells from human umbilical cord blood.,"A significant number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) in human umbilical cord blood could serve as a reservoir for the placental vasculature, yet, their morphological and functional features are not completely understood. Here, we describe the characterization of purified CD133(+) progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood, a subset of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors that were grown in proliferation medium containing Flt3-ligand, thrombopoietin and stem cell factor. Following isolation and enrichment of the CD133(+) cells by immunomagnetic cell sorting, they remained non-adherent for up to 40 days in culture and expressed different pluripotency markers including Sox-1, Sox-2, FGF-4, Rex-1 and Oct-4.Oct-4 expression was confirmed by laser-assisted single cell picking with subsequent quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The expression of Oct-4 indicates a pluripotent phenotype of CD133(+) cells and appears to be of functional relevance: After three weeks in endothelial differentiation medium, suspended cells became adherent, developed an endothelial cell-like morphology, bound fluoresceine isothiocyanate-labeled Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1, took up acetylated Di-LDL, and expressed other endothelial markers such as PECAM-1 or VEGFR-2. Concomitantly, Oct-4 expression was significantly reduced. Moreover, following treatment with retinoic acid, CD133(+) cells exhibited neural morphology associated with the expression of beta-III-tubulin. CD133(+) cells were found to express the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG) receptor, detected by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. The recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin induced proliferation of the CD133(+) cells in a dose-specific manner. Our results indicate that CD133(+) HSPC from umbilical cord blood may have a greater differentiation potential than previously recognized and give rise to proliferative endothelial cells participating in placental vasculogenesis."
2004,15577221,Studies on interactions between functional foods or dietary supplements and medicines. IV. Effects of ginkgo biloba leaf extract on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine in healthy volunteers.,"The effects of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE), a widely used herbal dietary supplement in Japan, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine (NFP), a calcium-channel blocker, were studied using 8 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous oral ingestion of GBE (240 mg) did not significantly affect any of the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of either NFP or dehydronifedipine, a major metabolite of NFP, after oral administration of NFP (10 mg). However, the maximal plasma NFP concentrations in 2 subjects were approximately doubled by GBE, and they had severer and longer-lasting headaches with GBE than without GBE, with dizziness or hot flushes in combination with GBE. The mean heart rate after oral administration of NFP with GBE tended to be faster than that without GBE at every time point. Accordingly, it was concluded that GBE and NFP should not be simultaneously ingested as much as possible, and careful monitoring is needed when administering NFP concomitantly with GBE to humans."
2019,30519710,"Targeted disruption of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, via PI3K inhibitors, promotes growth inhibitory effects in oral cancer cells.","The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is the frequently altered in human cancer. This has led to the development and study of novel PI3K inhibitors for targeted therapy and also to overcome resistance to radiotherapy.The anti-tumour effects of PI3K inhibitors (PI-828, PI-103 and PX-866) in terms of cell proliferation, colony formation, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, invasion, autophagy, and pNF-κB/p65 translocation in SCC-4, SCC-9 and SCC-25 cells were studied by performing MTT, clonogenic, DAPI staining, propidium iodide staining, annexin-V binding, matrigel invasion, acridine orange staining and immuno-fluorescence assay. Western blot assay was performed to assess the alteration in the expression of various proteins.PI-828 and PI-103 treatment exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of growth and proliferation of OSCC cells with a concomitant induction of apoptosis, altered cell cycle regulation and decreased invasiveness (p < 0.01). PX-866 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy and a significant decrease in the invasiveness of oral cancer cells as compared to untreated cells (p < 0.01). These compounds significantly reduced expression of COX-2, cyclin-D1 and VEGF in the treated cells besides cytoplasmic accumulation of pNF-κB/p65 protein. In addition to PI3Kα, inactivation of downstream components, i.e. Akt and mTOR was seen.PI3K inhibitors such as PI-103, PI-828 and PX-866 may be developed as potential therapeutic agents for effective treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients, associated with activated PI3K/Akt pathway."
2017,29217165,"Anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities of a methanolic extract of Morinda citrifolia Linn. (noni) fruit in mice: Involvement of benzodiazepine-GABAAergic, serotonergic and adrenergic systems.","This study presents anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of a methanolic extract of Morinda citrifolia Linn. (noni) fruit (MMC) in well-established mouse models of anxiety and depression. The administration of MMC (1 g/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated anxiety-like behaviour in mice by increasing the percentage of time spent and number of entries in the open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and significantly enhanced the exploration in the light box in the light/dark test (LDT). The pre-treatment with flumazenil (6 mg/kg, i.p.) or bicuculline (3 mg/kg, i.p.) or WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized the anxiolytic-like effect elicited by MMC (1 g/kg, p.o.). These results suggest the possible involvement of benzodiazepine-GABAAergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the anxiolytic-like effect of noni fruit. Meanwhile, in the antidepressant study, the administration of MMC (0.5 and 0.75 g/kg, p.o.) and desipramine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, pre-treatment of mice with 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis) for four consecutive days or a single dose of WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg, i.p., 5HT1A receptor antagonist) or α-methyl-DL-tyrosine (AMPT; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of noradrenaline synthesis) significantly reversed the anti-immobility effect of MMC (0.5 g/kg, p.o.) in TST by indicating the specific involvement of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the antidepressant-like effect of noni fruit. Taken together, these findings suggest that MMC has both anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities to be resorted as a valuable alternative therapy for comorbid anxiety and depressive conditions."
2006,16628139,Response of CEDIA amphetamines assay after a single dose of bitter orange.,"Bitter orange has recently been substituted as an ingredient in many ""ephedra-free"" dietary supplements used for weight loss. The primary active ingredient in bitter orange is synephrine. Previous reports have documented false-positive results from ephedrine with urine amphetamine assays. Because of the similarity in chemical structure of ephedrine and synephrine, it is hypothesized that ingestion of a bitter orange supplement may have the potential to cause false-positive results with urine amphetamine assays. The purpose of this study was to determine the response of the CEDIA Amphetamines Assay after ingestion of bitter orange. Six healthy adult male volunteers were administered a single oral dose of Nature's Way Bitter Orange, a 900-mg dietary supplement extract standardized to 6% synephrine. Urine specimens were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 hours post-administration. Additional urine specimens were collected from 1 subject at 9, 12, and 15 hours after administration. All specimens were analyzed by the CEDIA Amphetamines Assay. Urine specific gravity and pH also were measured. All urine specimens demonstrated a negative response to the CEDIA Amphetamines Assay. Urine specific gravity ranged from 1.007 to 1.028, and pH ranged from 5.0 to 7.0; thus, reducing the possibility that the negative results were caused by diluted specimens or reduced excretion of synephrine into alkaline urine. This information will be of value when health care providers or those who interpret drug screens are asked to provide consultation regarding the interference of bitter orange supplements with the CEDIA Amphetamines Assay. A single-dose of Nature's Way Bitter Orange was not found to cause a false-positive response to the CEDIA Amphetamines Assay in 6 healthy adult male volunteers."
2011,20966169,The interplay between tissue plasminogen activator domains and fibrin structures in the regulation of fibrinolysis: kinetic and microscopic studies.,"Regulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) depends on fibrin binding and fibrin structure. tPA structure/function relationships were investigated in fibrin formed by high or low thrombin concentrations to produce a fine mesh and small pores, or thick fibers and coarse structure, respectively. Kinetics studies were performed to investigate plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis in the 2 types of fibrin, using wild-type tPA (F-G-K1-K2-P, F and K2 binding), K1K1-tPA (F-G-K1-K1-P, F binding), and delF-tPA (G-K1-K2-P, K2 binding). There was a trend of enzyme potency of tPA > K1K1-tPA > delF-tPA, highlighting the importance of the finger domain in regulating activity, but the differences were less apparent in fine fibrin. Fine fibrin was a better surface for plasminogen activation but more resistant to lysis. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy using orange fluorescent fibrin with green fluorescent protein-labeled tPA variants showed that tPA was strongly associated with agglomerates in coarse but not in fine fibrin. In later lytic stages, delF-tPA-green fluorescent protein diffused more rapidly through fibrin in contrast to full-length tPA, highlighting the importance of finger domain-agglomerate interactions. Thus, the regulation of fibrinolysis depends on the starting nature of fibrin fibers and complex dynamic interaction between tPA and fibrin structures that vary over time."
2014,24128571,Vitiquinolone--a quinolone alkaloid from Hibiscus vitifolius Linn.,"Phytochemical investigations of the powdered root of Hibiscus vitifolius Linn. (Malvaceae) was extracted successively with n-hexane and chloroform. Analysis of the n-hexane extract by GC-MS led to the identification of twenty-six components by comparison of their mass spectra with GC-MS library data. A novel quinolone alkaloid, vitiquinolone (5) together with eight known compounds viz. β-Amyrin acetate (1), n-octacosanol (2), β-Amyrin (3), stigmasterol (4), xanthyletin (6), alloxanthoxyletin (7), xanthoxyletin (8) and betulinic acid (9) were isolated from chloroform extract by column chromatography over silica gel. The structure of vitiquinolone was established on the basis of spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, 1D, 2D NMR and ESI-MS. The known compounds were identified on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data as reported in the literature. "
1996,8556699,Modulation of carcinogen-induced DNA damage and repair enzyme activity by dietary riboflavin.,"Formation of single strand breaks in nuclear DNA induced by hepatocarcinogens aflatoxin B1 and N-nitrosodimethylamine was observed to be more pronounced in rats maintained on a riboflavin-deficient diet compared to that on a normal diet. This increased damage was reversed on riboflavin supplementation. The induction of repair enzymes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA polymerase beta and DNA ligase was significantly higher in riboflavin-deficient rats following DNA damage caused by the administration of carcinogens. Riboflavin supplementation brought down the induction to the levels found in rats maintained on normal diet. Since damage to DNA and its altered repair may relate to carcinogenesis, modulation of these parameters by riboflavin suggests a potential chemopreventive role of this vitamin."
2002,12017748,[Pain management with herbal antirheumatic drugs].,"Herbal antirheumatics are indicated in painful inflammatory and degenerative rheumatic diseases. Their mechanism of action is broader than that of synthetic antirheumatics. Particular preparations from Devils's Claw with 50 to 100 mg of harpagoside in the daily dosage as well as a particular willow bark extract with 120 to 240 mg salicin in the daily dosage proved efficacy in a number of clinical studies including confirmatory ones. Exploratory studies indicate that these herbal antirheumatics were not inferior to the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib when treating acute exacerbations of chronic low back pain. For the proprietary nettle root extract IDS23 promising in vitro/in vivo results indicate an anti-inflammatory effect, however there are only 2 open uncontrolled clinical studies available and the proof of efficacy is still missing. Safety data in order to recommend use during pregnancy and lactation are only available for the herbal combination product Phytodolor prepared from aspen, ash and goldenrod. In principle, blackcurrent leaf with not less than 1.5% flavonoids may be an appropriate antirheumatic. Likewise, the seed oils of blackcurrent, evening primrose and borage offering at least 1 to 3 g gammalinolenic acid/day are recommendable. In case superiority versus placebo has been established, proprietary herbal antirheumatics should be administered before the conventional analgesics due to the lower incidence of adverse events."
2014,24476483,Wild blueberry consumption affects aortic vascular function in the obese Zucker rat.,"This study evaluates the effect of wild blueberry (WB) consumption on the biomechanical properties of the aorta in the obese Zucker rat (OZR), a model of the metabolic syndrome. Thirty-six OZRs and 36 lean controls (lean Zucker rats) were placed either on a WB-enriched or a control (C) diet for 8 weeks. Phenylephrine (Phe)-mediated vasoconstriction and acetylcholine (Ach)-mediated vasorelaxation in the aortic vessel were investigated, as well as the contribution of the nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways in each of the above responses by using specific inhibitors. Obese Zucker rats exhibited a reduced vasocontstrictor response to Phe and an exaggerated vasorelaxant response to Ach. The WB diet partially restored Phe-induced constrictor responses and attenuated Ach-induced relaxant responses in OZR. Plasma nitric oxide was significantly attenuated (22.1 ± 1.1 μmol·L(-1), WB vs 25.6 ± 1.4 μmol·L(-1), C, p ≤ 0.05) with the WB diet. Thromboxane A2 levels in the aortic effluent were not significantly affected in the WB diet group, while PGI2 concentration significantly increased (766.5 ± 92.2 pg·mg(-1) aorta in the WB vs 571.7 ± 37.8 pg·g(-1) aorta in the C group, p ≤ 0.05). Downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and COX2 expression in the OZR aorta was observed in the WB diet group. In conclusion, WB consumption altered the biomechanical properties of the OZR aorta by partially restoring the impaired Phe-induced constrictor responses and attenuating the exaggerated response to Ach-induced vasorelaxation.

2018,29091871,Hepatoprotective effect of berberine against methotrexate induced liver toxicity in rats.,"Hepatotoxicity is one of the major side effects of methotrexate (MTX), which restricts the clinical use of this drug. Berberine (BBR) is a natural compound with multiple pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the effect of BBR on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity was studied. A total number of 28 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups. Rats were pretreated with BBR orally with dose of 100mg/kg for 10 consecutive days and MTX (20mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administrated on the 9th day. Then on day 11, blood samples were collected to determine serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The extracted livers were used for histological examination, biochemical assays and real time PCR studies. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl (PC), nitric oxide (NO) levels, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities were assessed in hepatic tissue. In addition, the expression of SOD and PGx was measured using real-time PCR method in hepatic tissue. Results showed that MTX administration significantly increases AST, ALT and ALP levels (all p<0.001). It also, increases MDA, PC, NO levels and MPO activity (p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively). Moreover, MTX decreases hepatic GSH level, SOD, GPx and CAT activities (all p<0.001). Pre-treatment with BBR for 10days prevented some of these changes. Serum levels of AST and ALT decreased (all p<0.001). Hepatic MDA level decreased (p<0.001) and GSH level as well as GPx activity increased (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively). Our results indicated that BBR might be useful for prevention of the hepatotoxicity induced by MTX via ameliorative effects on biochemical and oxidative stress indices."
2005,16020506,"Clinical factors predictive of outcome with bortezomib in patients with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma.","Bortezomib, a potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor, affects the myeloma cell and its microenvironment, resulting in down-regulation of growth and survival signaling pathways and durable responses in patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. Potential associations between baseline parameters and outcomes with bortezomib were explored in 202 patients who received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 twice weekly for 2 weeks every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles in a phase 2 trial. Using European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria, the response rate (complete or partial response) to bortezomib alone was 27% and was not associated with sex, race, performance status, isotype, chromosome 13 deletion, number or type of previous therapies, or concentration of hemoglobin or beta2-microglobulin. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with lower response were being age 65 or older versus younger than 65 (19% vs 32%; P < .05) and plasma-cell infiltration in bone marrow greater than 50% versus 50% or less (20% vs 35%; P < .05). Factors that may be indicative of tumor burden (bone marrow plasma-cell infiltration greater than 50%, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia) were predictive of overall survival. Chromosome 13 deletion and elevated beta2-microglobulin, generally considered poor prognostic factors, were not predictive of poor outcome with bortezomib in this study."
2016,24870200,Influence of glycyrrhizin on permeability and elasticity of cell membrane: perspectives for drugs delivery.,"Glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid (GA) - triterpene glycoside extracted from licorice root - has been intensively studied over the past decade and is considered to be a potential drug delivery system. Glycyrrhizin was found to enhance the therapeutic effect of various drugs; however the detailed mechanism of these effects is still unknown and attracts the attention of researchers. In this work, we have made an attempt to clarify the mechanism of Glycyrrhizin activity on molecular and cellular level. The influence of GA on the functional properties of biomembranes was investigated via NMR spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) using human erythrocytes as a model system. GA was shown to increase the permeability (about 60%) and to decrease elasticity modulus of cell membranes (by an order of magnitude) even in micromolar concentrations. Changes on the erythrocyte surface were also detected by AFM. These results could provide a new insight on the mechanism of bioavailability enhancement of some drugs in the presence of glycyrrhizin, as well as the mechanism of its own biological activity. The role of cholesterol-glycyrrhizin binding in the observed effects is also discussed. "
1999,10419901,Basic fibroblast growth factor is expressed by CD19/CD11c-positive cells in hairy cell leukemia.,"Several features are characteristic for hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Among those are pancytopenia, bone marrow fibrosis, and the appearance of a defined tumor cell phenotype in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and spleen. Hairy cells (HC) coexpress antigens specific for B lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages and thus the malignant cell does not seem to be restricted to a defined lineage. When serum or bone marrow aspirate was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), specimen derived from HCL (serum: mean value, 29 pg/mL; BM aspirate: mean value, 641 pg/mL) contained significantly higher levels than those from healthy subjects. To study whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients suffering from HCL and healthy donors (HD) were capable of producing bFGF, culture supernatant (conditioned medium, [CM]) was tested for the presence of this cytokine. While bFGF was not detectable in cell cultures from HD, HCL-derived CM contained relatively high levels of bFGF. CM was successfully used for stimulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation, which could be inhibited by a neutralizing anti-bFGF antibody. Cellular activation by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or the combination of 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus calcium ionophore (Ca-Ip) led to an enhanced mRNA expression. Results of Western blot experiments showed that HC synthesize at least three isoforms (approximately 18, 23, and 25 kD), but only the 23-kD isoform is exported. To assess the nature of the producer cell, double immunofluorescence analysis using a bFGF-specific and an anti-CD11c monoclonal antibody (MoAb) was undertaken. The majority of cells scoring positive for CD11c were also reactive with the anti-bFGF MoAb. Furthermore, enrichment of CD19/CD11c-positive cells correlated with enhanced bFGF levels, thereby supporting the argument for HC being the producer cells of bFGF. A biological function of bFGF in HCL might be mediation of chemoresistance, as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA)-induced inhibition of cell proliferation can be reversed by bFGF. Endogenous bFGF production by HC is not affected by this purine analogue and 2-CdA-induced apoptosis is diminished in bFGF-producing HC as compared with normal PBMC. Therefore, bFGF expression by HC might be important for resistance to chemotherapy and survival of the malignant cells."
1986,3708723,Cytosolic activation of hematin-dependent microsomal monooxygenase activity in the lung.,"Additions of micromolar concentrations of hematin to washed rat pulmonary microsomal preparations resulted in marked (5-7-fold) increases in the NADPH-dependent generation of phenolic metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). 9-Hydroxy-BaP was identified as the major reaction product. Additions of pulmonary cytosolic fractions to microsomes produced no measurable effect but cytosol and hematin added together elicited 25-30-fold increases in total phenolic products. Cytosolic fractions from other tissues, including rat kidneys and perfused rat livers, were also highly effective in enhancing the hematin-mediated increases in monooxygenase activity. However, cytosol from human placental tissues was only minimally effective when either pulmonary or placental microsomes were utilized as enzyme source. Superoxide dismutase and catalase (alone or in combination) had no measurable effect on hematin-mediated increases. Horseradish peroxidase effectively inhibited the hematin-dependent reactions but hematin-independent reactions were inhibited with equal effectiveness. Carbon monoxide profoundly inhibited all hematin-mediated increases in metabolite formation. The activating cytosolic component was non-dialyzable, inactivated by trypsin and heat, and eluted in the void volume from Sephadex G-150 columns. This suggested that the cytosolic factor(s) responsible for the increased hematin-dependent oxidation was a protein(s) with a high molecular weight or perhaps an aggregate or oligomer of proteinaceous material. HPLC profiles indicated a major effect on the generation of phenolics; quinones were also increased but only minimal increases in diols were observed. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that hematin-mediated increases in pulmonary monooxygenase activity result from an increased association of a small pool of pulmonary P-450-apoprotein(s) with the hematin prosthetic group to result in increased levels of an unidentified holocytochrome(s) with a relatively high substrate turnover number. The current data suggest a quaternary interaction among P-450 apoprotein(s), heme prosthetic group, reaction products (particularly 3-hydroxy-BaP) and a cytosolic protein(s). We postulate that the mechanism of action of the cytosolic factor is to facilitate the interaction of hematin with the apocytochrome."
1999,10188978,Suppression of nitric oxide synthase and the down-regulation of the activation of NFkappaB in macrophages by resveratrol.,"Resveratrol, naringenin and naringin are naturally occurring flavonoids in grapes and grapefruits. The anti-inflammatory effects of these flavonoids have been well documented, but the mechanism is poorly characterized. High concentration of NO are produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in inflammation, and the prevention of the expression of iNOS may be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism. In this study, the effects of these flavonoids on the induction of NO synthase (NOS) in RAW 264.7 cells activated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 ng ml(-1)) were investigated. Resveratrol was found strongly to inhibit NO generation in activated macrophages, as measured by the amount of nitrite released into the culture medium, and resveratrol strongly reduced the amount of cytosolic iNOS protein and steady state mRNA levels. However, the inhibitory abilities of naringenin were lower, and the inhibitory abilities of naringin were almost negligible. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the activation of NFkappaB induced by LPS for 1 h was inhibited by resveratrol (30 microM). Furthermore, in immunoblotting analysis, cells treated with LPS plus resveratrol showed an inhibition of phosphorylation as well as degradation of IkappaBalpha, and a reduced nuclear content of NFkappaB subunits. The flavonoids may be of value for inhibiting the enhanced expression of iNOS in inflammation through down-regulation of NFkappaB binding activity."
2005,16392671,Hepatoprotective constituents of the edible brown alga Ecklonia stolonifera on tacrine-induced cytotoxicity in Hep G2 cells.,"In this study, ethanolic extracts from 18 seaweed variants were assessed for hepatoprotective activity against tacrine-induced cytotoxicity in Hep G2 cells. Only one of these, Ecklonia stolonifera Okamura (Laminariaceae), a member of the brown algae, exhibited promising hepatoprotective activity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the active ethyl acetate (EtOAc) soluble fraction obtained from the ethanolic extract of E. stolonifera, resulted in the isolation of several phlorotannins [phloroglucinol (1), eckstolonol (2), eckol (3), phlorofucofuroeckol A (4), and dieckol (5)]. Compounds 2 and 4 were determined to protect Hep G2 cells against the cytotoxic effects of tacrine, with EC50 values of 62.0 and 79.2 microg/mL, respectively. Silybin, a well characterized hepatoprotective agent, was used as a positive control, and exhibited an EC50 value of 50.0 microg/mL. It has been suggested that the phlorotannins derived from marine brown algae might prove useful sources in the development of novel hepatoprotective agents."
2014,24790007,Isolation and characterization of isopiperitenol dehydrogenase from piperitenone-type Perilla.,"Studying the biosynthesis of oil compounds in Perilla will help to elucidate regulatory systems for secondary metabolites and reaction mechanisms for natural product synthesis. In this study, two types of alcohol dehydrogenases, isopiperitenol dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (ISPD1 and ISPD2), which are thought to participate the oxidation of isopiperitenol in the biosynthesis of perilla, were isolated from three pure lines of perilla. Both ISPD1 and ISPD2 oxidized isopiperitenol into isopiperitenone with an oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) cofactor. ISPD1 used both isopiperitenol diastereomers, whereas ISPD2 used cis-isomer as a substrate. However, only ISPD2 was isolated from piperitenone-type perilla. These results suggests that in perilla, ISPD2 is related to the biosynthesis of piperitenone, which was formed via (-)-cis-isopiperitenol. "
2016,26299317,Grapefruit Juice and Statins.,"We determined the validity of current medical advice to avoid grapefruit juice consumption while taking 3 widely used statins. A daily glass of grapefruit juice increases blood levels of simvastatin and lovastatin by about 260% if taken at the same time (about 90% if taken 12 hours apart), and atorvastatin by about 80% (whenever taken). Simvastatin 40 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, and atorvastatin 10 mg daily reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in a 60-year-old man with an LDL cholesterol of 4.8 mmol/L by 37%, reducing ischemic heart disease risk by 61%. When simvastatin or lovastatin are taken at the same time as grapefruit juice, the estimated reduction in LDL cholesterol is 48%, and in heart disease is 70%. If the juice is taken 12 hours before these statins, the reductions are, respectively, 43% and 66%, and for atorvastatin, 42% and 66%. The increased rhabdomyolysis risk from grapefruit juice consumption due to the increased effective statin dose is minimal compared with the greater effect in preventing heart disease. Grapefruit juice should not be contraindicated in people taking statins. "
,14666716,Combined effects of resveratrol and paclitaxel on lung cancer cells.,"Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a phytoalexin found in grapes and other food products that can prevent cancer. We studied the in vitro biological activity of this compound by examining its effect on proliferation and inducing apoptosis in three lung cancer cell lines (A549, EBC-1, Lu65). Resveratrol inhibited the growth of A549, EBC-1 and Lu65 lung cancer cells by 50% (ED50) at concentrations between 5-10 microM. We also examined the combined effects in these cells of resveratrol and paclitaxel, an essential chemotherapeutic agent against lung cancer. Although simultaneous exposure to resveratrol plus paclitaxel did not result in significant synergy, resveratrol (10 microM, 3 days) significantly enhanced the subsequent antiproliferative effect of paclitaxel. In addition, resveratrol as well as paclitaxel induced apoptosis in EBC-1 and Lu65 cells, as measured by TUNEL and caspase assays, as well as flow cytometry. Resveratrol (10 microM, 3 days) similarly enhanced the subsequent apoptotic effects of paclitaxel. We examined the effects of resveratrol and paclitaxel on levels of p21waf1, p27kip1, E-cadherin, EGFR and Bcl-2 in EBC-1 cells. Resveratrol (10 microM, 3 days) prior to paclitaxel induced p21waf1 expression approximately 4-fold. These results suggest that resveratrol may be a promising alternative therapy for lung cancer and that lung cancer cells exposed to resveratrol have a lowered threshold for killing by paclitaxel."
2019,31387184,Effect of fatty acids from ethanol extract of Moringa oleifera seeds on kidney function impairment and oxidative stress induced by gentamicin in rats.,"Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside drug, used for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Despite its potency against bacterial infections, its clinical use is limited owing to nephrotoxicity effect. However, the study investigated the nephroprotective effect of fatty acids from ethanolic extract of Moringa oleifera seeds (EEMOS) against gentamicin-induced kidney injury in rats. Forty-five male Wistar rats, 100-160 g, were divided into 5 groups as follows: Group 1 (control), 5 rats, received 0.2 ml/100 g/day of propylene glycol orally for 28 days. Group 2, 10 rats, received 100 mg/kg/day (i.p) of gentamicin (GENT) for 8 days. Group 3-5, 10 rats each, treated with EEMOS orally for 28 days at graded doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively after GENT treatment. Twenty four after treatment, five rats from each group were sacrificed. The remaining 5 rats were sacrificed after 2 weeks recovery period from the drugs. The result showed that GENT elicited polyuria, elevated plasma creatinine, urea, and lower plasma electrolytes and creatinine clearance levels. Measurements of 24 h urinary output demonstrated marked decrease in creatinine and potassium levels in the GENT-treated group, whereas sodium level remain unchanged. Also, GENT caused significant decrease in superoxide dismutase and an increase in malondialdehyde levels in the kidney of the rats. Histopathological examination revealed evidence of necrosis of the kidney. Treatment with EEMOS significantly ameliorated the alterations caused by GENT in the plasma, urine and kidney homogenate of the rats. Hence, the mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids present in EEMOS were responsible for its renoprotective ability."
2009,19644845,Estimation of intragastric drug solubility in the fed state: comparison of various media with data in aspirates.,"The suitability of various media to forecast the solubility of ketoconazole and dipyridamole in the fed stomach at various periods after meal administration was evaluated. Solubilities were measured with the shake-flask method in gastric fluids aspirated 30, 60 and 120 min after administration of 500 ml Ensure plus to healthy fasted adults, in three sets of simulated gastric fluids based on milk, and in simple aqueous buffered media. Simple aqueous buffered media vastly underestimated the intragastric solubility of model compounds in the fed state. When using undigested milk-based media, the solubilities of model compounds in aspirates were also underestimated by a factor of 2.5-27. Solubility in milk digested with pepsin was useful for estimating the intragastric solubility of ketoconazole (within 20%) but overestimated the intragastric values of dipyridamole by a factor of 2-19. For both drugs, the solubility in milk digested with pepsin and lipase predicted the solubility in aspirates collected 60 min after meal administration, whereas at other times it overestimated the intragastric solubility (by a factor of <5). Both the use of biorelevant media and simulation of intragastric digestion are necessary for the prediction of drug solubility in the fed stomach. Milk digested with pepsin and lipase enabled the estimation of the intragastric solubility of dipyridamole and ketoconazole at 1 h after meal intake. Simulation of vesicle/micellar structures seems to be key for the prediction of intragastric solubility in the fed stomach."
2019,31126441,Hazelnut consumption improves testicular antioxidant function and semen quality in young and old male rats.,"The effects of hazelnut supplemented diet on the reproductive system of young and old male rats were investigated. Young male rats were grouped into young control group (YCG) and young hazelnut group (YHG). Old male rats were grouped into old control group (OCG), old hazelnut group (OHG), and old vitamin E group (OEG). While YCG and OCG were given rat feed, YHG and OHG were given rat feed supplemented with hazelnut (3 g/kg body weight). OEG was subjected to rat feed and administered vitamin E (50 mg/kg body weight). When YCG and OCG were compared, aging increased histopathological damage and decreased sperm quality. Hazelnut supplemented diet improved histopathological variables, sperm quality, seminal plasma and plasma oxidative stress, seminal plasma vitamin E, and plasma testosterone levels in both groups. The present work suggests that hazelnut supplemented diet significantly improves testicular antioxidant function and semen quality in old male rats."
2011,21600888,Ginsenoside Rb1 and its metabolite compound K inhibit IRAK-1 activation--the key step of inflammation.,"In the preliminary study, ginsenoside Rb1, a main constituent of the root of Panax ginseng (family Araliaceae), and its metabolite compound K inhibited a key factor of inflammation, nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) activation, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages. When ginsenoside Rb1 or compound K were orally administered to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfuric acid (TNBS)-induced colitic mice, these agents inhibited colon shortening, macroscopic score, and colonic thickening. Furthermore, treatment with ginsenoside Rb1 or compound K at 20mg/kg inhibited colonic myeloperoxidase activity by 84% and 88%, respectively, as compared with TNBS alone (p<0.05), and also potently inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, but increased the expression of IL-10. Both ginsenoside Rb1 and compound K blocked the TNBS-induced expressions of COX-2 and iNOS and the activation of NF-κB in mice. When ginsenoside Rb1 or compound K was treated in LPS-induced murine peritoneal macrophages, these agents potently inhibited the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines. Ginsenoside Rb1 and compound K also significantly inhibited the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), IKK-β, NF-κB, and MAP kinases (ERK, JNK, and p-38); however, interaction between LPS and Toll-like receptor-4, IRAK-4 activation and IRAK-2 activation were unaffected. Furthermore, compound K inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines more potently than did those of ginsenoside Rb1. On the basis of these findings, ginsenosides, particularly compounds K, could be used to treat inflammatory diseases, such as colitis, by targeting IRAK-1 activation."
2019,30990756,"Iodine in Edible Seaweed, Its Absorption, Dietary Use, and Relation to Iodine Nutrition in Arctic People.","Dietary iodine is important to human health, and both low and high iodine intake levels increase the risk of disease. Seaweed is rich in iodine and it is a common component in both Asian and in Arctic cuisines. While the intake and impact are known for Asian people, data are lacking for Arctic people. We aimed to (1) measure iodine content of dietary seaweeds in Greenland, (2) estimate iodine absorption, and (3) assess the impact on iodine intake in Arctic people. A hunter in East Greenland donated household seaweed for (1) measurement of iodine content and (2) ingestion of 45 g by each of eight individuals with subsequent urine collections. (3) In Ammassalik, 96% of 50-69-year-old Inuit reported on the frequency of intake of seaweed and provided a spot urine sample for iodine measurement. Seaweed species provided were Chondrus crispus and Ascophyllum nodosum. (1) The iodine content was 47 and 102 mg/g, respectively. (2) An estimated 1.1 and 1.9 mg of the ingested 2.1 and 4.6 of iodine in seaweed were excreted in the urine within 2 days. (3) More than two in three Inuit reported some dietary use, and 41% (109 of 268) reported a weekly intake of dietary seaweed, which was associated with iodine excretion. In conclusion, the iodine content of edible seaweeds in the Arctic is very high and bioavailable. Dietary intake contributed to the recommended iodine intake level, but marked variation in iodine excretion calls for evaluation of the impact on thyroid function."
1992,1553957,Marrow transplantation for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,"Between 1971 and 1990, nine patients ranging in age from 14-38 years received marrow transplants for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Six were transplanted for aplastic complications of PNH. Four of these were from HLA-identical siblings, and the patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide. One graft was form a syngeneic twin without conditioning, and one from a two HLA-antigen nonidentical father after conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Three of the four recipients of allogeneic marrow developed acute and two chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Five of six transplanted for severe aplastic anemia are long-term survivors with follow-up ranging from more than 6.2 to more than 19.1 years. The HLA nonidentical transplant recipient experienced graft rejection and died of a pulmonary hemorrhage. Three patients were transplanted for nonaplastic complications of PNH consisting of life threatening recurrent thromboses or refractory hemolysis. Two of these patients received marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings after conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. They are surviving with normal hemograms greater than 2.2 and greater than 2.5 years and had mild chronic GVHD which resolved, although one has biochemical evidence of PNH in 15% of the red cells. One received a syngeneic marrow graft without conditioning but reverted to PNH. He is alive greater than 8.6 years after transplantation. Marrow transplantation for aplastic complications of PNH is successful, well tolerated, and compatible with long-term survival when an HLA-identical sibling or a syngeneic donor is available. For patients without aplasia, one must weigh the complications of transplantation with the life threatening nature of thrombotic episodes and hemolysis."
1999,10588923,Cardioprotection by the phytoestrogen genistein in experimental myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury.,"1. Soybean phytoestrogens have no oestrogen agonist effects on the reproductive system and therefore it is reasonable to explore the potential of these naturally occurring plant oestrogens in the cardiovascular pathology. We therefore investigated the effects of genistein in a rat model of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. 2. Anaesthetized rats were subjected to total occlusion (45 min) of the left main coronary artery followed by 5 h reperfusion (MI/R). Sham operated rats were used as controls. Myocardial necrosis, myocardial myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), serum creatinine phosphokinase activity (CPK), serum and macrophage Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cardiac intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) immunostaining, cardiac mRNA for ICAM-1 evaluated by the means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR), ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial contractility (left ventricle dP/dt(max)) were evaluated. 3. Myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion in untreated rats produced marked myocardial necrosis, increased serum CPK activity and MPO activity both in the area-at-risk and in the necrotic area, reduced myocardial contractility, caused ventricular arrhythmias and induced a marked increase in serum and macrophage TNF-alpha. Furthermore myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury increased ICAM-1 expression in the myocardium. 4. Administration of genistein (1 mg kg(-1), i.v., 5 min after coronary artery occlusion) lowered myocardial necrosis and MPO activity in the area-at-risk and in the necrotic area, decreased serum CPK activity, increased myocardial contractility, decreased the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, reduced serum and macrophages levels of TNF-alpha and blunted ICAM-1 expression in the injured myocardium. Finally genistein added in vitro to peritoneal macrophages collected from untreated rats subjected to myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury significantly reduced TNF-alpha production. 5. Our data suggest that genistein limits the inflammatory response and protects against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury."
2016,26956696,Zinc Attenuates Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis in Diabetic Nephropathy Via Inhibition of HIF Through PI-3K Signaling.,"Evidence has demonstrated that hypoxia may have a central pathogenic mechanism in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of mature tubular epithelial cells in kidney is a contributor to the renal accumulation of matrix protein in DN and is highly associated with the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Zinc (Zn) has anti-fibrosis effects in liver and lungs. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of Zn on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis especially under hypoxic conditions and its association with DN. We found that Zn treatment blockaded tubular EMT and attenuated renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis by downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1α) in the kidneys of diabetic streptozotocin-treated mice. High glucose (HG)/hypoxic conditions stimulated EMT in renal tubular cells as indicated by the significant decrease in epithelial marker E-cadherin and ZO-1 while the increase in mesenchymal markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Zn supplement mainly prevented HG/hypoxic-induced HIF-1α accumulation and EMT marker changes. In co-treatment Zn with PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, inhibitor LY294002 prevented HG/hypoxic-induced HIF-1α increase and EMT changes, suggesting that Zn may mediate HG/hypoxic-induced EMT through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway. Therefore, we concluded that Zn had an important anti-fibrosis role under HG/hypoxic conditions, and a novel mechanism contributing to Zn protection on renal tubular epithelial cells from HG/hypoxia-induced EMT through activation of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, which subsequently leads to the downregulation of the expression of HIF-1α.

2016,26810212,"Chemical composition, antioxidant and anticholinesterase potentials of essential oil of Rumex hastatus D. Don collected from the North West of Pakistan.","Ethnomedicinally Rumex hastatus D. Don has been used since long for various ailments especially in neurological disorders. The reported data and the importance of Rumex genus demonstrate the vital medicinal value of R. hastatus.In the current investigational study, isolation of essential oil and its antioxidant and anticholinesterase assays were performed. The essential oil of R. hastatus was analyzed by GC-MS for the first time. The essential oil was evaluated for anticholinesterase and antioxidant assays. The anticholinesterase assay was conducted at various concentrations (62.5 to 1000 μg/ml) against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Similarly, the antioxidant potential was determined using DPPH and ABTS free radicals.The GC-MS analysis of essential oil showed 123 components. The result recorded for the anticholinesterase assays demonstrated a marked potential against AChE and BChE with IC50 values of 32.54 and 97.38 μg/ml respectively which were comparable with the positive control i.e., galanthamine (AChE, IC50 = 4.73 μg/ml and BChE, IC50 = 11.09 μg/ml). The antioxidant assays against DPPH and ABTS free radicals also exhibited significant scavenging potential with IC50 values of 3.71 and 6.29 μg/ml respectively, while for ascorbic acid the IC50 value was <0.1 μg/ml against both free radicals.Based on the current investigational studies, it may be concluded that R. hastatus is an effective source of essential oil's components having anticholinesterase and antioxidant potentials, which after subjecting to drug development may lead to novel drug candidates against neurodegenerative disorders."
2019,30551479,Sedative and hypnotic effects of Vaccinium bracteatum Thunb. through the regulation of serotonegic and GABAA-ergic systems: Involvement of 5-HT1A receptor agonistic activity.,"The present study was conducted to investigate the sedative and hypnotic activities of Vaccinium bracteatum Thunb. fruit (VBFW) in an animal model and to identify the underlying mechanisms of its action. VBFW exhibited sedative effects through a reduction in the locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT). In addition, VBFW significantly reduced the sleep latency and increased total sleep duration in pentobarbital-induced sleeping behaviors in mice. The effects of 4-Chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA) were studied in normal and serotonin-depleted mice. Additionally, the changes in the related serum corticosterone (CORT) and neurotransmitter levels were evaluated. Pretreatment with VBFW (50, and 100 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in the immobility time in the forced swim test (FST), while VBFW 100 plus PCPA treatment attenuated the change in immobility time observed following administration of VBFW alone. However, VBFW plus PCPA treatments did not significantly influence the changes in the locomotor activity that were induced by VBFW alone. The results suggest that VBFW leads to a decrease in the levels of serum CORT and norepinephrine in the hippocampus (HC) region (P < 0.01). Furthermore, PCPA treatment alone decreased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the HC (P < 0.05) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC; P < 0.05), while VBFW plus PCPA significantly increased the 5-HT levels in both the HC and the PFC (P < 0.05). In addition, we also found that VBFW showed a strong agonistic effect at the 5-HT1A receptor by activating 5-HT1A receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similarly, VBFW (30 and 100 μg/mL) significantly increased the intracellular Cl- influx through its effects on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA receptor) subunits (α5, β1, and β2) in primary rat cerebellar granule cells. Moreover, the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)65/67 protein was upregulated following VBFW treatment (30 and 100 μg/mL). The results of our study indicate that VBFW induces sedative and hypnotic effects by regulating the serotonergic and GABAA-ergic systems, which is possibly associated with 5-HT1A receptor agonistic activity. Additionally, this data suggests that VBFW up-regulates intracellular Cl- and GABAA receptor subunits as well as GAD65/67 protein levels."
2006,16310985,"Damage of zinc fingers in DNA repair proteins, a novel molecular mechanism in carcinogenesis.","Zinc finger motifs participate in protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions in many groups of proteins, including those involved in DNA repair. The Zn(II) ion, bonded tetrahedrally to cysteine thiolates and/or histidine imidazole groups, maintains the three-dimensional structure, crucial for the function of the domain. Zinc fingers can thus be compromised by a substitution of Zn(II) with another metal ion or by a release of Zn(II), due to the oxidation of thiolate donors. The latter may result from an action of redox-active metals or other oxidative agents. Studies in cell cultures and ex vivo demonstrated that soluble compounds of definite carcinogenic metals and metalloids, such as arsenic, cadmium and nickel, and putative carcinogens, including cobalt and lead, inhibit zinc finger containing DNA repair proteins. Further experiments demonstrated that these metals, as well as endogeneous oxidative substances, including hydrogen peroxide, nitrosoglutathione, and reducible selenium compounds damage or distort zinc finger domains. This reactivity can therefore be regarded as a novel molecular mechanism in carcinogenesis."
2002,12242608,Metallothionein and antioxidant enzymes in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with zinc.,"The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant animal model for Wilson's disease. It is known that an abnormal accumulation of Cu and Fe in the liver and low concentrations of both ceruloplasmin and Cu in the serum occur in these rats. The accumulation of Cu is explained by the defective expression of the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase gene, homologous to the gene for Wilson's disease (ATP7B). The aim of this work was to clarify the action mechanism of Zn, and to verify the role that this metal plays in LEC rats in short-term treatment experiments (1 and 2 weeks) on concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, metallothionein (MT), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh(8)dG) and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It is well known that Zn induces MT and has the ability to prevent redox-active metals, Cu and Fe, binding to and causing oxidative damage at active sites of Zn metalloenzymes and nonspecific binding sites on proteins. Zn administration reduces Cu and Fe transport from mucosal to serosal intestinal sides through competitive mechanisms. Our findings show that treatment with zinc acetate increases tissue Zn and MT contents and decreases Cu and Fe concentrations in the liver and kidneys, even if hepatic Zn and MT concentrations decrease with treatment period. Induction of MT synthesis by Zn contributes to the reduction in free radicals produced by Cu and Fe. We also observed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD)activity in liver decreases with treatment duration in association with the Cu and Fe liver decrease. However, the SOD activity in kidney increases in untreated rats at 2 weeks relative to those untreated for 1 week."
2013,23603294,Infliximab counteracts tumor necrosis factor-α-enhanced induction of matrix metalloproteinases that degrade claudin and occludin in non-pigmented ciliary epithelium.,"Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), effectively treats anterior uveitis, which can accompany Behçet's disease. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanism of this action. We examined human, non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPCECs), which make up the blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) in the uvea. We measured the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs in the presence or absence of TNF-α using quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 increased in the presence of TNF-α, and the addition of infliximab reversed the increase. The TNF-α effects were more attenuated when infliximab was added before than when it was added after TNF-α exposure. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that the protease activity of these MMPs was also increased in the presence of TNF-α and attenuated with infliximab. Immunostaining showed that MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 degraded claudin-1 and occludin in HNPCECs and in non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells of the swine ciliary body. In a monolayer of HNPCECs, we found that permeability was significantly increased with MMP treatment. Thus, TNF-α increased levels of MMPs in cells that form the BAB, and MMPs degraded components of the tight junctions in the BAB, which increased permeability through the cellular barrier. Furthermore, infliximab effectively attenuated the TNF-α-induced increases in MMP expression in cells that make up the BAB. These findings might suggest a basis for the clinical prevention of anterior uveitis."
2012,22019891,A clinical study on the short-term effect of berberine in comparison to metformin on the metabolic characteristics of women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent reproductive and metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance (IR). Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid extracted from Chinese medicinal herbs that has been used as an insulin sensitizer. BBR may have a potential therapeutic value for PCOS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of BBR in comparison to metformin (MET) on the metabolic features of women with PCOS.Eighty-nine subjects with PCOS and IR subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: BBR+compound cyproterone acetate (CPA; n=31), MET+CPA (n=30), and placebo+CPA (n=28) for 3 months. Clinical characteristics of the women and metabolic and hormonal parameters were assessed before and after the period of treatment.Treatment with BBR in comparison to MET showed decrease in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; P<0.01), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC; P<0.05) as well as increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; P<0.05). Similarly, treatment with BBR in comparison to placebo showed decrease in WHR, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment for IR, area under the curve of insulin, TC, LDLC, and TG (P<0.05) as well as increase in HDLC and SHBG (P<0.01).Intake of BBR improved some of the metabolic and hormonal derangements in a group of treated Chinese women with PCOS. Main effects could be related to the changes in body composition in obesity and dyslipidemia. Further controlled studies are needed for the assessment of the potential favorable metabolic effects of BBR in women with PCOS."
2018,29607931,Ginsenoside-Rg1 Protects against Renal Fibrosis by Regulating the Klotho/TGF-β1/Smad Signaling Pathway in Rats with Obstructive Nephropathy.,"Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1) is an agent isolated from Panax ginseng that exerts anti-fibrotic effects; however, the mechanism is still unclear. Herein, we investigated whether G-Rg1 administration can mitigate or reverse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis by regulating the Klotho/transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathway in rats. Sprague-Dawley male rats were subjected to UUO, and rats in the treatment group were administered G-Rg1 or G-Rg1 plus Klotho short hairpin RNA interference (shRNA), while rats in the control and model groups were administered vehicle for 14 d. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers and Klotho/TGF-β1 signaling molecules were examined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry showed that UUO induced increased pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 expression, overexpression of the mesenchymal marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and suppression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin. Moreover, Western blotting analysis indicated that UUO promoted TGF-β1 and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) expression (p<0.01), but blocked Klotho and Smad7 expression (p<0.01). After G-Rg1 administration, the UUO-induced TGF-β1 and p-Smad3 expression was suppressed (p<0.01), whereas the reduced Klotho and Smad7 expression was reversed (p<0.05), followed by amelioration of the EMT process. Intriguingly, the G-Rg1 effects were largely abrogated by Klotho knockdown. Furthermore, Klotho expression was upregulated by G-Rg1 treatment at the mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that G-Rg1 may be beneficial for ameliorating renal fibrosis by targeting Klotho/TGF-β1/Smad signaling in UUO rats."
2014,24799204,"The effect of postharvest calcium application in hydro-cooling water on tissue calcium content, biochemical changes, and quality attributes of sweet cherry fruit.","To improve storage/shipping quality of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), the effect of calcium chloride (CaCl2) added to hydro-cooling water on physiological and biochemical processes related to fruit and pedicel quality was investigated on two major cultivars. The fruit tissue Ca content increased up to 29-85% logarithmically for 'Sweetheart' and 39-188% linearly for 'Lapins' as CaCl2 rate increased from 0.2% to 2.0% at 0 °C for 5 min. The increase of fruit tissue Ca content was accompanied by reductions in respiration rate, ascorbic acid degradation, and membrane lipid peroxidation, which enhanced total phenolics content and total antioxidant capacity, and resulted in increases in fruit firmness and pitting resistance and decreases in titratable acidity loss and decay of both cultivars. Pedicel browning was inhibited by CaCl2 at 0.2% and 0.5%, but increased by higher rates at 1.0% and 2.0%, possibly via modifying membrane lipid peroxidation."
1998,9895422,Traditional fermentation increases goitrogenic activity in pearl millet.,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that millet might play a role in the etiology of endemic goiter. Recently, we showed that a traditional fermentation procedure of two pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum L. Lecke) cultivars grown in Sudan modified their effects on the weight of the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone profile in rats. In the present study, we report that this fermentation procedure reduced the ash contents of millet by about 40% and removed considerable amounts of Mg (>50%), Zn (27-39%) and K (45%). Other minerals (Ca, Fe, Cu) were not affected. Feeding of one fermented cultivar resulted in significant reduction in bone Mg and Zn contents, whereas feeding of the other fermented cultivar resulted in reduction of bone Mg only. Dietary Mg intake and bone Mg contents correlated negatively with serum T3. Groups fed the millet diets had higher serum Se level compared to those fed wheat or casein diets and feeding of fermented millet resulted in a further increase in serum Se level. Thus our data indicate that in rats the enhanced effects of millet on the thyroid induced by fermentation is likely related to removal of minerals from millet and/or chemical transformation of the goitrogens contained in millet."
2014,24588674,Uncoupling protein-2 mediates the protective action of berberine against oxidative stress in rat insulinoma INS-1E cells and in diabetic mouse islets.,"Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) may regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The current study investigated the effects of berberine, an alkaloid found in many medicinal plants, on oxidative stress and insulin secretion through restoration of UCP2 expression in high glucose (HG)-treated INS-1E cells and rat islets or in db/db mouse islets.Mouse and rat pancreatic islets were isolated. Nitrotyrosine, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 and UCP2 expression and AMPK phosphorylation were examined by Western blotting. Insulin secretion was measured by ELISA. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by confocal microscopy.Incubation of INS-1E cells and rat islets with HG (30 mmol·L(-1); 8 h) elevated nitrotyrosine level, reduced SOD-1 and UCP2 expression and AMPK phosphorylation, and inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. HG also increased mitochondrial ROS in INS-1E cells. Co-treatment with berberine inhibited such effects. The AMPK inhibitor compound C, the UCP2 inhibitor genipin and adenovirus ucp2 shRNA inhibited these protective effects of berberine. Furthermore, compound C normalized berberine-stimulated UCP2 expression but genipin did not affect AMPK phosphorylation. Islets from db/db mice exhibited elevated nitrotyrosine levels, reduced expression of SOD-1 and UCP2 and AMPK phosphorylation, and decreased insulin secretion compared with those from db/m(+) mice. Berberine also improved these defects in diabetic islets and genipin blocked the effects of berberine.Berberine inhibited oxidative stress and restored insulin secretion in HG-treated INS-IE cells and diabetic mouse islets by activating AMPK and UCP2. UCP2 is an important signalling molecule in mediating anti-diabetic effects of berberine."
2006,16921400,Delphinidin and cyanidin inhibit PDGF(AB)-induced VEGF release in vascular smooth muscle cells by preventing activation of p38 MAPK and JNK.,"Red wine polyphenols (RWPs) inhibit the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major pro-angiogenic and pro-atherosclerotic factor, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The aim of this study was to identify which red wine polyphenols were inhibitory and to determine the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects.Release of VEGF stimulated by platelet derived growth factor(AB) (PDGF(AB)), from human aortic VSMCs was measured by immunoassay and phosphorylation of kinases by Western blot analysis. The direct antioxidant properties of polyphenols were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance and the cellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by dichlorofluorescein.The inhibitory effect of RWPs on PDGF(AB)-induced release of VEGF was mimicked by delphinidin but not by quercetin, catechins, resveratrol, gallic acid or caffeic acid. In the anthocyanin class, not only delphinidin but also cyanidin prevented VEGF release whereas malvidin and peonidin were without effect. RWPs, delphinidin and cyanidin directly scavenged ROS and prevented the PDGF(AB)-induced formation of ROS in VSMCs. Malvidin and peonidin did not scavenge ROS but prevented the cellular formation of ROS. Although the p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK pathways have been involved in the PDGF(AB)-induced expression of VEGF, in our experiments, only phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK was inhibited by RWPs, delphinidin and cyanidin.Anthocyanins presenting a hydroxyl residue at position 3' are able to inhibit PDGF(AB)-induced VEGF expression by preventing activation of p38 MAPK and JNK in VSMCs."
2011,30634254,"Lipid components, fatty acid distributions of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in rice brans.","Endogenous tocochromanols in extracted lipids from rice brans of the five cultivars were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and were investigated in relation to the fatty acid (FA) distribution of triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL). The dominant tocols were α-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol, followed by α-tocotrienol and with much smaller amounts of γ-tocopherol and δ-tocotrienol. The lipids of these rice brans comprised mainly TAG (80.6-86.0wt.%), free FA (4.2-9.0wt.%), and phospholipids (5.5-6.7wt.%), whilst other components were also detected in minor proportions (0.2-2.1wt.%). The PL components included phosphatidyl choline (31.8-46.8wt.%), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (25.0-38.9wt.%) and phosphatidyl inositol (20.2-23.2wt.%). Comparison of these different cultivars showed, with a few exceptions, no significant differences (P>0.05) in FA distribution. FA distribution of TAG among the five cultivars was evident in the rice brans: unsaturated FA were predominantly concentrated at the sn-2 position and saturated FA primarily occupying the sn-1 or sn-3 position. These results suggest that the tocopherol content, lipid component, and FA distribution in rice brans are not dependent on the cultivation areas during the growing season."
2017,28055105,Restoration of perivascular adipose tissue function in diet-induced obese mice without changing bodyweight.,"We have recently shown that a reduced function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes crucially to obesity-induced vascular dysfunction in mice. The current study was conducted to test the hypothesis that vascular dysfunction in obesity can be reversed by in vivo improvement of PVAT eNOS activity.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks to induce obesity. During the last 4 weeks of HFD feeding, the obese mice were treated p.o. with the standardized Crataegus extract WS® 1442, which has been shown previously to improve eNOS activity.Diet-induced obesity in mice markedly reduced the vasodilator response of thoracic aorta to acetylcholine in wire myograph experiments. Strikingly, this vascular dysfunction was only evident in PVAT-containing aorta but not in PVAT-free aorta. In vivo treatment of obese mice with WS® 1442 had no effect on body weight or epididymal fat mass, but completely restored the vascular function of PVAT-containing aorta. Feeding a HFD led to a reduced phosphorylation and an enhanced acetylation of PVAT eNOS, both effects were reversed by WS® 1442 treatment.PVAT plays a key role in vascular dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice. Not obesity itself, but a PVAT dysfunction is responsible for obesity-induced vascular disorders. Improving PVAT function by pharmacological means (e.g. with WS® 1442) can ameliorate vascular function even without reducing body weight or fat mass.This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

2006,16840727,A randomized phase 2 study of lenalidomide therapy for patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.,"This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2 study evaluated 2 dose regimens of lenalidomide for relapsed, refractory myeloma. Seventy patients were randomized to receive either 30 mg once-daily or 15 mg twice-daily oral lenalidomide for 21 days of every 28-day cycle. Patients with progressive or stable disease after 2 cycles received dexamethasone. Analysis of the first 70 patients showed increased grade 3/4 myelo-suppression in patients receiving 15 mg twice daily (41% versus 13%, P = .03). An additional 32 patients received 30 mg once daily. Responses were evaluated according to European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. Overall response rate (complete, partial, or minor) to lenalidomide alone was 25% (24% for once-daily and 29% for twice-daily lenalidomide). Median overall survival in 30-mg once-daily and twice-daily groups was 28 and 27 months, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months on once-daily versus 3.9 months on twice-daily lenalidomide (P = .2). Dexamethasone was added in 68 patients and 29% responded. Time to first occurrence of clinically significant grade 3/4 myelosuppression was shorter in the twice-daily group (1.8 vs 5.5 months, P = .05). Significant peripheral neuropathy and deep vein thrombosis each occurred in only 3%. Lenalidomide is active and well tolerated in relapsed, refractory myeloma, with the 30-mg once-daily regimen providing the basis for future studies as monotherapy and with dexamethasone."
2009,19091365,Comparison of effect of high intake of magnesium with high intake of phosphorus and potassium on urolithiasis in goats fed with cottonseed meal diet.,"The effect of high intake of Mg on urolithiasis was compared with high intake of P and K in goats being fed with a cottonseed meal and rice straw diet. Eighteen wether goats were randomly allocated into group A, B and C evenly and fed with cottonseed meal and rice straw diet for three months. From day 60 onwards, KH(2)PO(4) and K(2)HPO(4) were provided via drinking water to goats in group B to increase the intake of P, K, and MgO to goats in group C to increase the intake of Mg. Blood and urine samples were collected to analyze the concentration of P, K, Mg and Ca, and the activity product (AP) of potassium magnesium phosphate (MKP) in urine was also calculated. The composition of calculi and urinary sedimentary crystals were examined by chemical qualitative analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the incidence of urolithiasis in group C (6/6) was higher than that in group A (1/6) and B (1/6) (P<0.05). The calculi were mainly composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) and partly composed of MKP. MKP presented in crystals of different phases in this experiment. The high intake of Mg contributed to a significant increase of plasma Mg, but additional P, K did not cause a further increase of plasma P, K. Urine P, K, Mg and Ca and AP of MKP in group C decreased significantly after the onset of urolithiasis. In conclusion, high intake of Mg was more important in inducing struvite calculi compared with high intake of K and P in goats under these feeding conditions. Cottonseed meal and rice straw with additional Mg is a good dietary model for inducing struvite calculi in castrated goats."
2001,11704635,Ginsenosides Rb1 and Re decrease cardiac contraction in adult rat ventricular myocytes: role of nitric oxide.,"1. Panax ginseng is used to enhance stamina and relieve fatigue as well as physical stress. Ginsenoside, the effective component of ginseng, regulates cardiovascular function. This study was to examine the effect of ginsenosides Rb1 and Re on cardiac contractile function at the cellular level. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rat hearts and were stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Contractile properties analysed included: peak shortening (PS), time-to-90%PS (TPS), time-to-90% relengthening (TR90), and fluorescence intensity change (DeltaFFI). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was determined by the 3H-arginine to 3H-citrulline conversion assay. 2. Both Rb1 and Re exhibited dose-dependent (1-1000 nM) inhibition in PS and DeltaFFI, with maximal inhibitions between 20-25%. Concurrent application Rb1 and Re did not produce any additive inhibition on peak shortening amplitude (with a maximal inhibition of 24.9+/-6.1%), compared to Rb1 or Re alone. Pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM) abolished the effect of Rb1 and Re. Both Rb1 and Re significantly (P<0.05) stimulated NOS activity concentration-dependently. 3. This study demonstrated a direct depressant action of ginsenosides on cardiomyocyte contraction, which may be mediated in part through increased NO production."
2016,25323694,Studies on pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of aminophylline in partridge chickens.,"Veterinary medicine plays a significant role in the development of animal husbandry. Drugs residual in food would follow the food-chain coming into human body, which might bring hidden dangers to people. Chicken is the prime source of meat food, whose quality is important for our life and health. Therefore, it is necessary to realize the withdrawal period and establish an efficient, sensitive and accurate method for monitoring the metabolic process of drugs in chicken body. In this paper, the pharmacokinetics of aminophylline in partridge chicken after intravenous and oral administration was investigated using a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method. Plasma concentration-time profiles of aminophylline were analyzed by a non-compartmental model using Topfit 2.0. Following intravenous and oral administration, the peak concentrations (C max) were found to be (16.5 ± 3.0) µg/mL at (0.08 ± 0) h and (7.4 ± 1.5) µg/mL at (1.83 ± 1.11) h, respectively. The elimination half-time (t 1/2) after intravenous and oral administration were, respectively, (13.1 ± 4.17) h and (11.65 ± 1.14) h. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were (209.6 ± 22.8) µg h mL(-1)(AUC0-t ) and (219.5 ± 28.3) µg h mL(-1) (AUC0→∞ ) after intravenous, and (165.1 ± 37.0) µg h mL(-1)(AUC0-t ) and (179.3 ± 35.6) µg h mL(-1) (AUC0→∞ ) after oral administration. Mean retention time (MRT) after intravenous and oral administration were, respectively, (14.06 ± 0.86) and (15.27 ± 0.62) h. The total clearance rates (CLtol) were (0.77 ± 0.10) mL min(-1) kg(-1) of intravenous and (0.97 ± 0.20) mL min(-1) kg(-1) of oral administration. The apparent distribution volume (V d) was (0.87 ± 0.27) and (0.97 ± 0.20) L kg(-1), respectively, for intravenous and oral administration. The absolute bioavailability (F) after oral administration was (83.1 ± 11.7) %. The results showed that aminophylline in partridge chickens had a longer elimination half-time, a smaller clearance rate, as well as a higher absolute bioavailability for oral administration. Therefore, aminophylline in partridge chickens produced a long healing efficacy and oral administration can achieve a good absorption which could meet the requirement."
2014,24799209,Pancreatic lipase selectively hydrolyses DPA over EPA and DHA due to location of double bonds in the fatty acid rather than regioselectivity.,"The enzymatic hydrolysis of canola, anchovy and seal oils with different types and amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids was measured using porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) to establish the fatty acid selectivity of PPL. Substrates were subjected to the same conditions of hydrolysis, with percent hydrolysis monitored using Iatroscan and fatty acid selectivity monitored using gas chromatography (GC). Regardless of their distribution on the glycerol backbone, as monitored by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were rapidly cleaved by PPL while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and stearidonic acid (STA) were hydrolysed more slowly. Results show that PPL preferentially hydrolyses ALA and DPA over EPA, DHA and STA, and this selectivity is due to fatty acid rather than regioselectivity. The primary structural factor associated with resistance to PPL appears to be the distance of the first double bond from the ester linkage being hydrolysed. "
2012,22750059,Niacin reduces plasma CETP levels by diminishing liver macrophage content in CETP transgenic mice.,"The anti-dyslipidemic drug niacin has recently been shown to reduce the hepatic expression and plasma levels of CETP. Since liver macrophages contribute to hepatic CETP expression, we investigated the role of macrophages in the CETP-lowering effect of niacin in mice. In vitro studies showed that niacin does not directly attenuate CETP expression in macrophages. Treatment of normolipidemic human CETP transgenic mice, fed a Western-type diet with niacin for 4 weeks, significantly reduced the hepatic cholesterol concentration (-20%), hepatic CETP gene expression (-20%), and plasma CETP mass (-30%). Concomitantly, niacin decreased the hepatic expression of CD68 (-44%) and ABCG1 (-32%), both of which are specific markers for the hepatic macrophage content. The decrease in hepatic CETP expression was significantly correlated with the reduction of hepatic macrophage markers. Furthermore, niacin attenuated atherogenic diet-induced inflammation in liver, as evident from decreased expression of TNF-alpha (-43%). Niacin similarly decreased the macrophage markers and absolute macrophage content in hyperlipidemic APOE*3-Leiden.CETP transgenic mice on a Western-type diet. In conclusion, niacin decreases hepatic CETP expression and plasma CETP mass by attenuating liver inflammation and macrophage content in response to its primary lipid-lowering effect, rather than by attenuating the macrophage CETP expression level."
2016,27402099,Effect of formulation variables on oral grittiness and preferences of multiparticulate formulations in adult volunteers.,"Multiparticulate formulations are composed of multiple solid dosage units which can be administered directly to the mouth or sprinkled on food. Oral grittiness (i.e. rough mouthfeel) may arise from the presence of particles in the mouth, limiting palatability. In this work, multiparticulate formulations were prepared by dispersion of spherical granules into orange flavoured vehicles thickened with hypromellose (HPMC) at different viscosities in order to assess oral perception of grittiness by a panel of thirty adults through direct scaling on a 100mm visual analogue scale. The effect of formulation factors such as particle size (90, 127, 263μm), amount of particles per 10ml (0.25, 0.50, 1.00g) and viscosity of the vehicle (0.08, 0.43, 2.80Pas) were investigated. Grittiness was increasingly perceived with increasing amount and size of particles. Increasing viscosity of the administration media had a masking effect on the perception of particles. Less gritty samples were generally regarded as 'more pleasant' by the participants of the study. However, samples dispersed in thickened vehicles seemed to be less preferred despite being less gritty; which could be ascribed to an unpleasant mouthfeel of the vehicle. In the design of multiparticulate formulations acceptable for a targeted patient group all these formulation factors will need to be considered and optimised. "
2000,10996663,Tolerance to cadmium hepatotoxicity by metallothionein and zinc: in vivo and in vitro studies with MT-null mice.,"The protective role of metallothionein (MT) in Cd-mediated hepatotoxicity was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Following injection of Cd (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous) hepatoxicity was significantly greater at 20 h in metallothionein-null (MT-/-) mice, compared with controls (MT+/+). The decrease in the blood and liver glucose concentrations correlated with the extent of hepatotoxicity, with blood glucose 43% lower in MT-/- mice. Zinc (50 microM) and/or Dex (1 microM) were used in hepatocyte cultures to raise MT 2-5-fold. When Cd at 10 microM was co-treated with Zn and/or Dex, lactate dehydrogenase (LD) leakage in the MT+/+ and MT-/- hepatocytes was reduced only when Zn was present. Cellular glutathione (GSH) was the same in control MT+/+ and MT-/- cultures and was uninfluenced by Zn and Dex. After treatment with 5 and 10 microM Cd, GSH levels were lower in MT-/- than MT+/+ hepatocytes in the control and Dex groups. Higher GSH concentrations were maintained in Zn co-treated cultures from both genotypes, indicating that the superior protective effect of Zn may in part derive from its influence on cellular GSH. Pre-treatment with Zn and/or Dex provided no further protection than co-treatment. Tolerance to brief (15 min) Cd exposure was also investigated in the presence of MT inducers including progesterone (100 microM). Zn, Dex and progesterone treated hepatocytes had less LD leakage than controls with Zn giving the greatest protection (LD leakage 18% of controls at 100 microM Cd). Zn pre-treated cells had higher cytosolic/particulate ratios of Cd. These findings demonstrate that MT protects primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes from short-term exposure to Cd. Zn enhances the protection through MT and non-MT mechanisms."
2001,11360489,Evaluation of the method for nifedipine administration for a rapid onset of clinical effect: a clinical study in normal volunteers.,"Nifedipine is frequently used for patients who require an immediate reduction of blood pressure elevated temporarily by various administration techniques including sublingual route without administrating intravenous infusion of vasodilator. A cross-over clinical study was conducted to investigate the optimal administration method of nifedipine for rapid management of hypertension. Four method of administering 10 mg nifedipine (the capsule was bitten and swallowed, sublingually with a hole in it or the contents administered orally or intranasally with a syringe) were evaluated with regarded efficacy, safety, and usefulness in 6 normal volunteers. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were correlated with the nifedipine serum concentration in each method. Nifedipine pharmacokinetic parameters differed among the 4 administration methods. Nifedipine was absorbed rapidly by not only intestinal mucosa but also the nasal or oral mucosa. The pharmacological effect of intranasal or sublingual administration was superior. However, mint oil which is present in nifedipine capsules stimulates nasal mucosa when administered intranasally. For clinical usage, nifedipine capsules in which a hole is made with a needle, administered sublingually, can be effectively and safely used for rapid management of systemic hypertension."
2007,17284857,Distribution of tocotrienols in rats fed a rice bran tocotrienol concentrate.,"To examine the distribution of rice bran tocotrienol (T3), we gave rice bran T3 to rats after considering an acceptable daily intake of vitamin E for humans. Male SD rats (5 weeks of age) were fed for 3 weeks on a commercial diet containing 6.4 mg of vitamin E per 100 g wt and additively received vitamin E or the vehicle (vitamin E-free corn oil) by oral intubation. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups depending on the type of test diet: control (vehicle), non-T3 (no T3 + 4.3 mg of tocopherol (TOC)/kg body weight (b.w.)/day), low-T3 (0.8 mg T3 + 3.5 mg TOC/kg b.w./day), and high-T3 (3.2 mg T3 + 1.1 mg TOC/kg b.w./day). The control rats and rats in the non-T3, low-T3, and high-T3 groups took 4.3 and 8.6 mg of vitamin E/kg b.w./day, respectively. Rice bran gamma-T3 was significantly distributed to the adipose tissue and increased from 1.1 to 10.2 nmol/g of adipose tissue according to the rice bran T3 intake."
2014,25510573,Effect of selected local medicinal plants on the asexual blood stage of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum.,"The development of resistant to current antimalarial drugs is a major challenge in achieving malaria elimination status in many countries. Therefore there is a need for new antimalarial drugs. Medicinal plants have always been the major source for the search of new antimalarial drugs. The aim of this study was to screen selected Malaysian medicinal plants for their antiplasmodial properties.Each part of the plants were processed, defatted by hexane and sequentially extracted with dichloromethane, methanol and water. The antiplasmodial activities of 54 plant extracts from 14 species were determined by Plasmodium falciparum Histidine Rich Protein II ELISA technique. In order to determine the selectivity index (SI), all plant extracts demonstrating a good antiplasmodial activity were tested for their cytotoxicity activity against normal Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell lines by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.Twenty three extracts derived from Curcuma zedoaria (rhizome), Curcuma aeruginosa (rhizome), Alpinia galanga (rhizome), Morinda elliptica (leaf), Curcuma mangga (rhizome), Elephantopus scaber (leaf), Vitex negundo (leaf), Brucea javanica (leaf, root and seed), Annona muricata (leaf), Cinnamomun iners (leaf) and Vernonia amygdalina (leaf) showed promising antiplasmodial activities against the blood stage chloroquine resistant P. falciparum (EC50 < 10 μg/ml) with negligible toxicity effect to MDBK cells in vitro (SI ≥10).The extracts belonging to eleven plant species were able to perturb the growth of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum effectively. The findings justified the bioassay guided fractionation on these plants for the search of potent antimalarial compounds or formulation of standardized extracts which may enhance the antimalarial effect in vitro and in vivo."
2001,11348576,Effects of the whole seed and a protein isolate of faba bean (Vicia faba) on the cholesterol metabolism of hypercholesterolaemic rats.,"The aim of the present work was to analyse the hypocholesterolaemic efficiency of a Vicia faba-protein isolate in relation to the intact legume. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the effects of this isolate were investigated. Hypercholesterolaemic rats were divided into three groups and fed high-fat diets rich in cholesterol-containing casein, whole seeds of Vicia faba or the protein isolate of faba beans as protein source, for 2 weeks ad libitum. The protein isolate was prepared by isoelectric precipitation and spray dried. Analyses of serum, liver and faeces, as well as of the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, were assessed by enzymatic methods. The rats fed on Vicia faba diets showed significantly lower body weights and energy intakes than rats fed on casein diets. The whole-seed diet induced a significant reduction in plasma triacylglycerol. Feeding rats on diets containing faba bean seeds, or the protein isolate, induced a significant decrease in plasma (LDL+VLDL)-cholesterol but not in HDL-cholesterol. Hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerol were also reduced. The hypocholesterolaemic effects of Vicia faba were not the result of a reduction in cholesterol synthesis as assessed from HMG-CoA reductase activity, but the result of an increase in steroid faecal excretion. The faba bean-protein isolate obtained under our experimental conditions was useful in improving the metabolic alterations induced by feeding with a hypercholesterolaemic diet compared with casein. The effectiveness of the whole seeds was higher than that of the protein isolate."
1998,9537613,Bioavailability of iron glycine as a fortificant in infant foods.,"The bioavailability of iron glycine added to a vegetable infant weaning food was compared with ferrous sulfate. Stable, isotopically labeled compounds (57Fe or 58Fe) were mixed into the midday meal (1.4 mg added Fe/serving) and fed to 9-mo-old infants on alternate days for 8 d. Bioavailability, expressed as a percentage of the dose consumed, was measured from isotopic enrichment of hemoglobin 14 d after the last test meal. There was no difference between iron glycine and ferrous sulfate (x+/-SEM): 9.0+/-0.7% and 9.9+/-0.8%, respectively. The effect of chelation was examined by measuring iron bioavailability of iron glycine and ferrous sulfate added to a high-phytate (310 mg/100 g) whole-grain cereal weaning food and comparing it with a lower-phytate (147 mg/100 g) vegetable food, as used in the first study. Both iron compounds had lower bioavailability from the high-phytate food, 5.2+/-0.5% for iron glycine and 3.8+/-0.9% for ferrous sulfate, than the lower-phytate food, 9.8+/-1.5% for iron glycine and 9.1+/-1.3% for ferrous sulfate. The results showed no significant difference in bioavailability between the two forms of iron when added to infant weaning foods, suggesting that the glycine complex was fully or partially dissociated in the gastrointestinal tract. It is concluded that chelation does not improve the bioavailability of iron in the presence of dietary inhibitors."
2012,22797325,Antibacterial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity of extracts and fractions of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) Benth. stem bark and Ageratum conyzoides Linn. leaves.,"Many species of plants in African countries are widely used in the rural communities where there is little or no access to modern medicine. However, the safety and effectiveness of these medicinal plants are poorly evaluated. The stem bark of Parkia biglobosa Jacq. and leaves of Ageratum conyzoides Linn. were investigated for their antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. The plant materials were extracted with 95% ethanol, and fractionated with petroleum ether, chloroform and ethyl acetate. The antibacterial effects of the extracts and fractions of the plant materials were assayed on the bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium perfringes. Ethanol extracts of P. biglobosa and A. conyzoides were screened for cytotoxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Two cancer cell lines (SK-MES 1 and SK-LU 1) and one normal cell line (human skin fibroblast cell line, FS5) were used for the screening of the extracts and the fractions obtained. The ethanolic extracts and fractions of P. biglobosa and A. conyzoides showed the best activity against E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA. All fractions of A. conyzoides leaves have no activity against P. aeruginosa. Human lung cancer cell lines (SK-LU 1 and SK-MES 1) and human skin fibroblast cell line (FS5 cells) were treated with various concentrations (3.9μg/ml-2mg/ml) of the extracts and fractions for 24h. SK-MES 1 cells are more susceptible to treatment with the plant fractions. All the fractions of A. conyzoides leaves and the petroleum ether fraction of P. biglobosa were cytotoxic to SK-MES 1 cells, which to some extent may support their traditional inclusion in herbal preparations for treatment of cancer. The overall results provided evidence that the studied plant extracts might be potential sources of new antibacterial and anticancer drug."
2018,29962406,Anticancer Efficacy of the Combination of Berberine and PEGylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in Meth A Sarcoma-Bearing Mice.,"Berberine, the main isoquinoline alkaloid obtained from traditional plants, e.g., Berberis, Coptis, Coscinium spps., etc., is known to exhibit anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the anticancer potential of berberine combined with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lip-DOX) was investigated. At first, the effect of berberine on endothelial cells was examined in vitro by use of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs): Berberine inhibited HUVEC growth with an IC50 at 24 h of about 144 µg/mL and that at 72 h of about 29 µg/mL. In contrast, less than 50 µg/mL berberine inhibited the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression to some extent after a 24-h incubation, suggesting that berberine suppressed angiogenic action under the condition of little cytotoxicity. Next, the in vivo anticancer activity of the combination of berberine (intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and PEG-lip-DOX (intravenously (i.v.)) was examined in Meth A sarcoma-transplanted BALB/c mice. The results showed that either berberine or PEG-lip-DOX exhibited antiproliferative activity against Meth A cells. Moreover, treatment with the combination of berberine and PEG-lip-DOX suppressed the tumor growth more strongly than that with berberine or PEG-lip-DOX alone. Based on these findings, the combination cancer chemotherapy with berberine and PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin may be beneficial for the treatment of cancer."
2010,20696143,Resveratrol modulates angiogenesis through the GSK3β/β-catenin/TCF-dependent pathway in human endothelial cells.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in angiogenesis due to its potent and specific ability to promote the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Resveratrol has been shown to have many health-benefiting effects, including the protection of cardiovascular system. In this study we examined the effect of resveratrol on angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We observed that resveratrol was able to modulate the expression of VEGF and the formation of vascular network in a biphasic pattern. While resveratrol at low concentrations, from 1 to 10μM, up-regulated the expression of VEGF and promoted angiogenesis, it had opposite effect at high concentrations (20μM and higher). The biphasic effect of resveratrol on angiogenesis was confirmed by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Up-regulation of VEGF expression depended on the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Correspondingly, GSK3β, a negative regulator of β-catenin, turned into a less active state (phosphorylated at Ser9) in cells exposed to 5μM of resveratrol, but became more active at 20μM. We demonstrated that both Akt and ERK signaling pathways, which are known to be critical for angiogenesis, became activated in response to 5μM of resveratrol and functioned to inactivate GSK3β. Our findings may have implications in the management of cardiovascular diseases and other conditions such as cancer by the use of resveratrol."
2005,15832823,Memory enhancing and neuroprotective effects of selected ginsenosides.,"The effects of ginsenosides Rg3(R), Rg3(S) and Rg5/Rk1 (a mixture of Rg5 and Rk1, 1:1, w/w), which are components isolated from processed Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae), on memory dysfunction were examined in mice using a passive avoidance test. The ginsenosides Rg3(R), Rg3(S) or Rg5/Rk1, when orally administered for 4 days, significantly ameliorated the memory impairment induced by the single oral administration of ethanol. The memory impairment induced by the intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine was also significantly recovered by ginsenosides Rg3(S) and Rg5/Rk1. Among the three ginsenosides tested in this study, Rg5/Rk1 enhanced the memory function of mice most effectively in both the ethanoland scopolamine-induced amnesia models. Moreover, the latency period of the Rg5/Rk1-treated mice was 1.2 times longer than that of the control (no amnesia) group in both models, implying that Rg5/Rk1 may also exert beneficial effects in the normal brain. We also evaluated the effects of these ginsenosides on the excitotoxic and oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell damage in primary cultured rat cortical cells. The excitotoxicity induced by glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was dramatically inhibited by the three ginsenosides. Rg3(S) and Rg5/Rk1 exhibited a more potent inhibition of excitotoxicity than did Rg3(R). In contrast, these ginsenosides were all ineffective against the H2O2- or xanthine/xanthine oxidase-induced oxidative neuronal damage. Taken together, these results indicate that ginsenosides Rg3(S) and Rg5/Rk1 significantly reversed the memory dysfunction induced by ethanol or scopolamine, and their neuroprotective actions against excitotoxicity may be attributed to their memory enhancing effects."
2019,30208279,Improving hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis as a postulated mechanism for the antidiabetic effect of Spirulina platensis in comparison with metformin.,"Various nutritional and medicinal potencies have been accredited to metabolites from the cyanobacteria, Spirulina platensis (Arthrospira platensis) sp. Hence, our study was designed to examine whether the Spirulina supplementation would possess beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in comparison with metformin. High-fat diet/low-dose streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) model was adopted and the diabetic rats were orally treated with metformin (200 mg/kg) or Spirulina (250 or 500 or 750 mg/kg) for 30 days. Spirulina ameliorated the HFD/STZ-induced elevation of fasting blood glucose, insulin, and hepatic enzymes. Moreover, Spirulina successfully rectified disrupted serum lipid profile and exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect via tumor necrosis factor-α and adiponectin modulation. On the molecular level, Spirulina reduced the expression of hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), confirming its lipotropic effect. Furthermore, Spirulina amended compromised hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis signaling by significantly increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. On almost all parameters, the highest dose of Spirulina showed the best effects, which were comparable to that of metformin. To our knowledge, our study is the first to attribute the various aspects of the effect of Spirulina to the SREBP-1c and PGC-1α/Tfam/mtDNA pathways in liver. The present results clearly proved that Spirulina modulated glucose/lipid profile and exhibited prominent anti-inflammatory properties through SREBP-1c inhibition and hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis enhancement. Thus, Spirulina can be considered as an add-on to conventional antidiabetic agents and might influence the whole dynamics of the therapeutic approaches in T2DM."
2017,28215206,Iodine intakes and status in Irish adults: is there cause for concern?,"I is an important mineral for health, required for the production of key thyroid hormones, which are essential for cellular metabolism, growth and physical development. Hence, adequate I is crucial at all stages of life, but imperative during pregnancy for fetal brain development and during a child's early life for neurodevelopment. Within Ireland, limited information exists on population I intakes and status. Therefore, the purposes of the present analysis were to estimate dietary I intakes and to analyse urinary iodine (UI) status using the cross-sectional National Adult Nutrition Survey 2008-2010 and the most recent Irish Total Diet Study. Median I intakes in the total population (n 1106) were adequate with only 26 % of the population being classified as below the estimated average requirement (EAR). Milk consumption was the major source of I in the diet, contributing 45 % to total intake. Likewise, median UI concentrations (107 µg/l) indicated 'optimal' I nutrition according to the WHO cut-off points. In our cohort, 77 % of women of childbearing age (18-50 years) did not meet the EAR recommendation set for pregnant women. Although I is deemed to be sufficient in the majority of adult populations resident in Ireland, any changes to the current dairy practices could significantly impact intake and status. Continued monitoring should be of priority to ensure that all subgroups of the population are I sufficient."
1999,10535759,Inhibitory effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells.,"Excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) may have cytotoxic effects through the formation of peroxynitrite with superoxide. The extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb) has been demonstrated to be a potent scavenger of free radicals. Although EGb has been shown recently to inhibit NO production in macrophages, its effect on NO production in endothelial cells is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which EGb affects NO production in a human endothelial cell line (ECV304). After cells were incubated with EGb (10-100 microg/mL) for 2 or 4 hr, the amounts of NO metabolites released by the cells were quantitated, and cellular NOS activities were determined following the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline. NOS protein expression was determined by western immunoblotting analysis. mRNA levels were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. EGb (50 microg/mL) caused a 30% reduction of NO metabolites released by endothelial cells. Following EGb treatment, cellular inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity was reduced by 28% with a concomitant reduction in the levels of iNOS protein mass and mRNA. There was no change in the activity or protein mass of constitutive NO synthase in these cells. EGb inhibited NO production by attenuating the level of iNOS mRNA in ECV304 cells. Selective inhibition of iNOS by EGb may be therapeutically relevant in modulating NO production in endothelial cells."
2014,25414433,The end of knight-errantry in GVHD studies.,"In this issue of Blood, Bolaños-Meade et al reported the results of the randomized phase 3 study Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMTCTN) 0802. It compared the addition of mycophenolate mofetil to steroids vs steroids/placebo to treat newly diagnosed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Unfortunately, it failed to show a significant difference in outcomes."
2014,24998345,Anti-Onchocerca activity and phytochemical analysis of an essential oil from Cyperus articulatus L.,"The lack of a safe and effective adult worm drug and the emergence of resistant animal parasite strains to the only recommended drug, the microfilaricide, ivermectin put many at risk of the devastating effects of the onchocerciasis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the acclaimed anti-Onchocerca activity of the roots/rhizomes of Cyperus articulatus in the traditional treatment of onchocerciasis in North Western Cameroon and to assess the plant as a new source of potential filaricidal lead compounds.Crude extracts were prepared from the dried plant parts using hexane, methylene chloride and methanol. The antifilarial activity was evaluated in vitro on microfilariae (Mfs) and adult worms of the bovine derived Onchocerca ochengi, a close relative of Onchocerca volvulus. The viabilities of microfilariae and adult male worms were determined based on motility reduction, while for the adult female worms the viability was based on the standard MTT/formazan assay. Cytotoxicity of the active extract was assessed on monkey kidney epithelial cells in vitro and the selectivity indices (SI) were determined. Acute toxicity of the promising extract was investigated in mice. Chemical composition of the active extract was unraveled by GC/MS analysis.Only the hexane extract, an essential oil exhibited anti-Onchocerca activity. The oil killed both the microfilariae and adult worms of O. ochengi in a dose manner dependently, with IC50s of 23.4 μg/ml on the Mfs, 23.4 μg/ml on adult male worms and 31.25 μg/ml on the adult female worms. Selectivity indices were 4, 4, and 2.99 for Mfs, adult males and adult females, respectively. At a single limit dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight, none of 6 mice that received the essential oil by gavage died. GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of terpenoids, hydrocarbons and fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives as components of the oil.The essential oil from the roots/rhizomes of Cyperus articulatus is active against O. ochengi microfilariae and adult worms in vitro in a dose dependent manner, hence may provide a source of new anti-filarial compounds. The results also support the traditional use of C. articulatus in the treatment of human onchocerciasis."
2020,31363990,"Zinc Supplementation Increased Bone Mineral Density, Improves Bone Histomorphology, and Prevents Bone Loss in Diabetic Rat.","Diabetic osteoporosis (DOP) is a complication of diabetes, with the characteristics of bone mineral density (BMD) reduction and bone structure destruction. Zinc was reported has a benefit effect on postmenopausal osteoporosise, it was also has hypoglycemic effect, whether zinc was beneficial on diabetes-induced osteoporosis has not been reported. So in the present study, we established a diabetic rat model by streptozotocin injection (60 mg/kg), and administered zinc sulfate by oral gavage to investigate the protective effects of zinc on DOP and the underline possible mechanism. Thirty six Sprague Dawley rats were divided into T1DM group (diabetic rats), control group (vehicle treatment), and T1DM-Zinc group (diabetic rats administered zinc sulfate 0.25 mg/kg by oral gavage). The bone histomorphological parameters, serum bone metabolism markers (including ALP, OPG, RUNX 2, and RANKL), BMD, and bone marrow adipocyte numbers were detected after eight weeks of zinc sulfate treatment. The results showed zinc sulfate administration (0.25 mg/kg/d) decreased blood glucose, increased the BMD, decreased serum ALP, and RANKL, increased serum OPG and RUNX 2 levels, as well as OPG/RANKL ratio of T1DM rats. Meanwhile, the bone histomorphological parameters, bone marrow adipocytes numbers were returned to be normal. The RUNX 2, and OPG mRNA expression levels in bone tissues of T1DM-Zinc group rats were increased after zinc sulfate treatment compared with the diabetic rats (P < 0.05). Those indicating that zinc sulfate can prevent DOP, the protective mechanism were mainly related to its hypoglycemic effect, bone marrow lipogenesis inhibition effect, OPG/RANKL ratio and RUNX 2 up-regulation effect."
2016,26781955,"Bioavailability of Cu, Zn and Mn from Mineral Chelates or Blends of Inorganic Salts in Growing Turkeys Fed with Supplemental Riboflavin and/or Pyridoxine.","An 84-day feeding trial was conducted in growing turkeys to measure the bioavailability of Cu, Zn and Mn from a commercial mineral chelate and corresponding inorganic salts in composite feeds containing supplemental riboflavin (B2) and/or pyridoxine (B6). A total of 320, 28-day-old British United Turkeys (BUT) were assigned to eight dietary treatments in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement comprising two trace mineral sources: chelated trace mineral blend (CTMB) and its corresponding inorganic trace minerals blend (ITMB) fed solely or with supplements of vitamin B2 (8 ppm) or B6 (7 ppm) or 8 ppm B2 + 7 ppm B6. Each treatment was replicated four times with 10 turkeys each. It was observed that turkeys fed with diets supplemented solely with ITMB elicited higher (P < 0.05) Zn excretion than their counterparts fed with diets containing ITMB with supplements of vitamins B2 and/or B6. Manganese retention was lower (P < 0.05) in turkeys fed with diets supplemented solely with ITMB than those fed with diets containing vitamins B2 and/or B6 additives. Combination of CTMB or ITMB with B6 improved (P < 0.05) the concentration of Mn in the liver and Cu in the bone. It was concluded that the minerals in CTMB were more available to the animals than ITMB. Furthermore, vitamins B2 and/or B6 supplementation improved the bioavailability of the inorganic Cu, Zn and Mn in growing turkeys and tended to reduce the concentration of these trace elements in birds' excreta.

2015,25851635,"Acute effects of calcium citrate with or without a meal, calcium-fortified juice and a dairy product meal on serum calcium and phosphate: a randomised cross-over trial.","Ca supplements, but not dietary Ca, have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This difference could be related to differences in their acute effects on serum Ca. We therefore examined the effects of Ca from different sources on serum Ca and phosphate in a randomised, cross-over trial of ten women (mean age of 69 years). Fasting participants received a single dose of 500 mg of Ca as citrate, citrate with a meal, fortified juice or a dairy product meal, with at least 6 d between each intervention. Blood was sampled before and 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after each intervention was ingested. Serum ionised and total Ca increased significantly from baseline over 6 h. Using calcium citrate fasting as a comparator, the elevations in ionised and total Ca were similar after fortified juice, delayed after calcium citrate with a meal and smaller after a dairy product meal. Serum phosphate and calcium-phosphate product increased from baseline after calcium citrate with a meal and after a dairy product meal, and they declined after calcium citrate fasting and after fortified juice. The elevations in serum Ca in the present study were only slightly different from those observed after the administration of 1000 mg of Ca in a previous study. These data indicate that different sources of Ca have different acute effects on serum Ca and support recommendations that dietary Ca might be safer than supplements. Whether these differences contribute to differences in cardiovascular risk requires further study."
1997,9308513,Mandrake toxicity. A case of mistaken identity.,"A 31-year-old man ingested an unknown amount of mandrake plant purchased at a local health food store and came to the emergency department with severe nausea and vomiting. He was hospitalized overnight but recovered uneventfully without obvious adverse systemic effects. This plant was almost certainly Podophyllum peltatum based on chromatographic identification of podophyllotoxin in a sample. However, the patient had mistakenly believed he was taking the anticholinergic and hallucinatory plant Mandragora officinarum, which is also known as mandrake. Other users of herbal substances and authors of the medical literature have also confused these 2 versions of mandrake. Given the growing popularity of alternative therapies, physicians should understand the distinction between these substances and should be aware of the medical effects of other commonly used herbal remedies."
2003,12682822,Experimental diabetes treated with ficus carica extract: effect on oxidative stress parameters.,"Parameters related to oxidative stress were studied in rats divided into 4 groups: streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (n=10), diabetic rats who received a single dose of a basic fraction of Ficus carica extract (n=14), diabetic rats who received a single dose of a chloroform fraction of the extract (n=10), and normal rats (n=10). Compared to normal animals, the diabetic animals presented significantly higher values for erythrocyte catalase normalized to haemoglobin levels (1.5+/-0.15 vs. 0.96+/-0.18 microg/mg) and for plasma vitamin E (73.4+/-43.9 vs. 12.0+/-1.6 mg/l), monounsaturated fatty acids (0.219+/-0.118 vs. 0.067+/-0.014 mg/ml), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 0.567+/-0.293 vs. 0.175+/-0.040 mg/ml), saturated fatty acids (0.779+/-0.262 vs. 0.401+/-0.055 mg/ml), and linoleic acid (0.202+/-0.086 vs. 0.106 +/-0.014 mg/ml). Both Ficus carica fractions tended to normalize the values of the diabetic animals' fatty acids and plasma vitamin E values. On studying the ratios of vitamins E and A to PUFA (129.4+/-77.5 diabetic and 68.8+/-9.1 microg/mg normal; 37.5+/-20.8 vs. 108.0+/-43.6 microg/mg) and to C18:2 (259.9+/-65.8 vs. 161.0+/-21.3 microg/mg; 68.3+/-37.9 vs. 252.7+/-102.1 microg/mg), we found statistically significant differences as a function of diabetes, with the vitamin E/C18:2 ratio being normalized by the administration of the chloroform fraction (to 152.1+/-80.3 microg/mg) and the vitamin A/C18:2 ratio being raised relative to the untreated diabetic rats by the administration of the basic fraction (91.9+/-14.5 microg/mg). Our work confirms that antioxidant status is affected in the diabetes syndrome, and that Ficus carica extracts tend to normalize it."
2016,26213018,Microencapsulation and storage stability of polyphenols from Vitis vinifera grape wastes.,"Wine production wastes are an interesting source of natural polyphenols. In this work, wine wastes extracts were encapsulated through vibration nozzle microencapsulation using sodium alginate as polymer and calcium chloride as hardening reagent. An experimental design approach was used to obtain calcium-alginate microbeads with high polyphenol content and good morphological features. In this way, the effect of pressure, frequency, voltage and the distance to the gelling bath were optimized for two nozzles of 150 and 300 μm. Long-term stability of the microbeads was studied for 6 months taking into account different storage conditions: temperatures (4 °C and room temperature), in darkness and in presence of light, and the addition of chitosan to the gelling bath. Encapsulated polyphenols were found to be much more stable compared to free polyphenols regardless the encapsulation procedure and storage conditions. Moreover, slightly lower degradation rates were obtained when chitosan was added to the gelling bath."
2003,12938569,[Premedication by thienopyridine before percutaneous coronary interventions in unstable angina].,"Ticlopidine or clopidogrel combined with aspirin decrease major cardiac events (Mace) after PTCA with stent implantation. It has not be proven yet that pretreatment by T or C was superior to conventional post-treatment, especially in unstable patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of thienopyridine pretreatment on the risk of Mace (death, Q wave myocardial infarction, need for repeat PTCA or surgery, angina recurrence, stent thrombosis) during the hospitalization period in a population prospectively included in 2 multicentre registries of patients undergoing placement of a S670 or S7 stent (Medtronic) implanted in native coronary arteries (> or = 3.0 mm). Among the 2929 patients included into the registries, 1205 had unstable angina (41%). 50.2% of the patients were pretreated by T or C (T = 15.7%, C = 34.5%); 85.5% received aspirin before the procedure; definition of pretreatment was the administration of drug at least 6 hours before stent implantation. GPIIb-IIIa antagonists were administered in only 13.9% of patients. Mace were observed in 2% of the patients. Factors correlated with Mace by univariate and multivariate analyses were: age > 73 years (RR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.05-5.36, P < 0.037), previous myocardial infarction (RR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.08-6.11, P < 0.034), pretreatment by T or C (RR: 0.389; 95% CI: 0.16-0.95, P < 0.038). In patients who did not receive GPIIb-IIIa antagonists, age > 73, and pretreatment by T or C were the only independent predictors of Mace."
2018,30259603,Thymoquinone inhibits the metastasis of renal cell cancer cells by inducing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.,"Thymoquinone (TQ, 2-methyl-5-isopropyl-1,4-benzoquinone), a bioactive constituent extracted from the seeds of Nigella sativa, has been proved to exert anti-tumor efficiency in various cancers. Autophagy is a self-digestion phenomenon, and its role in tumor formation and progression remains controversial. In the present study, we investigated the effects of TQ on renal cell cancer (RCC) cell lines (786-O and ACHN) using wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot analysis. We found that TQ effectively inhibited the metastatic capacity of RCC cells in vitro, which was also verified in a xenograft model. Meanwhile, we observed LC3 puncta and detected the expression of LC3 in TQ-treated RCC cells, and then found that autophagy was induced by TQ in 786-O and ACHN cell lines. In addition, TQ inhibited the migration and invasion as well as the EMT in RCC cells in an autophagy-dependent manner. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we detected the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. The results indicated that TQ inhibited the metastasis of RCC cells by inducing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy that aims at TQ-induced autophagy in RCC treatment."
2016,26776002,Agaricus bisporus and its in vitro culture as a source of indole compounds released into artificial digestive juices.,"The popularity of Agaricus bisporus results not only from the quality of the flavors, but also from the content of many substances of therapeutic properties. This paper presents a study on RP-HPLC determination of the content of indole compounds released from the lyophilized biomass from in vitro cultures of A. bisporus into artificial digestive juices at 37°C. A. bisporus in vitro cultures were grown on media enriched with zinc salts. The release of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan and l-tryptophan was found in the greatest number of samples. The content of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan in the investigated samples ranged from 86.62 to 531 mg/100g d.w. The amount of l-tryptophan was determined within the range of 1.63-4.68 mg/100g d.w. and for melatonin 0.43-0.64 mg/100g d.w. It was demonstrated for the first time that in vitro cultures of A. bisporus release indole compounds in conditions simulating the human digestive tract."
2017,28446500,"Protective effect of homovanillyl alcohol on cardiovascular disease and total mortality: virgin olive oil, wine, and catechol-methylation.","Background: Hydroxytyrosol is a phenolic compound that is present in virgin olive oil (VOO) and wine. Hydroxytyrosol-related foods have been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD).Objective: We investigated the associations between hydroxytyrosol and its biological metabolite, 3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol, also known as homovanillyl alcohol (HVAL), with CVD and total mortality.Design: We included 1851 men and women with a mean ± SD age of 66.8 ± 6 y at high risk of CVD from prospective cohort data. The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes; the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Twenty-four-hour urinary hydroxytyrosol and HVAL and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) rs4680 genotypes were measured.Results: After multivariable adjustment, all biomarkers were associated, as a continuous variable, with lower CVD risk, but only HVAL showed a strong inverse association (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.80) for the comparison between quintiles. Only HVAL, as a continuous variable, was associated with total mortality (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.95). Individuals in the highest quintile of HVAL compared with the lowest had 9.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 20.8) and 6.3 (95% CI: 2.3, 12.1) additional years of life or years free of CVD, respectively, after 65 y. Individuals with the rs4680GG genotype had the highest HVAL concentrations (P = 0.05). There was no association between COMT genotypes and events or interaction between COMT genotypes and HVAL concentrations.Conclusions: We report, for the first time to our knowledge, an independent association between high urinary HVAL concentrations and a lower risk of CVD and total mortality in elderly individuals. VOO and wine consumption and a high metabolic COMT capacity for methylation are key factors for high HVAL concentrations. The association that stems from our results reinforces the benefits of 2 key components of the Mediterranean diet (wine and VOO). This trial was registered at www.predimed.es as ISRCTN35739639."
2006,16462029,Effects of Ginkgo biloba extract feeding on salt-induced hypertensive Dahl rats.,"We previously demonstrated that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) produced vasodilation via the nitric oxide synthesis and release by increasing the intracellular calcium level in vascular endothelial cells of rats. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of dietary administration of GBE on the blood pressure and vascular tone of hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl) rats in order to evaluate its therapeutic actions and availability. Dahl rats were fed an 8.0% NaCl diet or an 8.0% NaCl plus 0.5% GBE diet for 24 d. The feeding of GBE did not change the heart rate, but significantly decreased systolic blood pressure. After 24 days' administration, the effects of GBE on the atria and aorta isolated from Dahl rats were examined. The GBE-containing diet did not affect the negative and positive actions of isolated atria that were produced by acetylcholine and isoproterenol, respectively. In the aortic preparations, the relaxation in response to acetylcholine was significantly potentiated by a GBE-containing diet. Sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unchanged by GBE-containing diet. These results demonstrated that GBE reduced salt-related elevation of blood pressure and restored the impaired acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in aortic segments."
2015,25442586,"Effect of organic acid pretreatment on some physical, functional and antioxidant properties of flour obtained from three unripe banana cultivars.","Unripe banana flour (UBF) obtained from organic acid pretreatment of pulp from three non-commercial cultivars were profiled for physical, functional and antioxidant properties. UBF showed marked significant differences (p<0.05) in colour (CIEL(∗)a(∗)b(∗) and CIELCH) and water holding capacity with no significant difference in oil holding capacity. The total polyphenol content (TPC) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) differed significantly with M-red UBF recording high TPC (1130.39 ± 27.26 mg GAE/100g d.w.) at 10 g/L citric acid pretreatment. Correlation analysis between TPC and DPPH showed very strong positive correlation for Mabonde UBF in citric and lactic acid pretreatment (r = 0.999, p < 0.01; r = 0.985, p < 0.01), while inverse correlation was recorded in M-red UBF for ascorbic and lactic acid pretreatment (r = -0.031; r = -0.137). Organic acid pretreatment enhances the physical and antioxidant properties of UBF hitherto absent in composite food formulations."
2019,30794781,Ginsenoside Rg1 attenuates protein aggregation and inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.,"Ginsenoside Rg1 (GS Rg1) is a glycosylated triterpenoid saponin extracted from Panax ginseng. We aim to investigate the impact of GS Rg1 on protein aggregation and inflammatory response in a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury model. Rats were administered different doses of GS Rg1 (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day) or nimodipine (1 mg/kg/day) for 5 consecutive days. Cerebral I/R injury was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h followed by a 22 h reperfusion period. Next, we examined the differences in infarct volume and neurological deficit via TTC staining and Longa's scoring, respectively. Furthermore, the differences in protein aggregates, proteasome, IκBα and NF-κB in the cerebral cortices were investigated through western blotting. The distribution of ubiquitin, proteasome and NF-κB in the neocortex were examined through immunohistochemistry. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA and proteasome activity was determined by fluorometric peptidaseassay. Treatment with GS Rg1 40 mg/kg resulted in a significantly lower infarct volume and improved the neurological deficit score as well as the histological appearance compared to the control I/R group (P < 0.05). GS Rg1 treatment resulted in significantly lower proinflammatory cytokine expressions and suppression of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB as well as the phosphorylation of IκBα (P < 0.01). Finally, GS Rg1 treatment decreased the proteasomal activity and protein aggregate accumulation in brain tissues (P < 0.01). Our results confirm the neuroprotective function of GS Rg1 at 40 mg/kg. This effect may be attributed to a decrease in ubiquitinated aggregates and a suppression of the inflammatory response after I/R insult."
2006,16137903,"Effect of gamma interferon on lung function of mustard gas exposed patients, after 15 years.","Bronchiolitis has been known to be among the main the pathological features of lung lesions in Mustard Gas (MG) exposed patients. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of interferon gamma-1b on the lung function in MG exposed patients with bronchiolitis.Thirty-six bronchiolitis patients, whose lung lesion had been diagnosed through High Resolution Computerized Tomography (HRCT) of the chest and also pathological study, were divided into two 18-member case and control groups. Both groups were receiving their conventional treatment (inhaled Felixotide and Servent). The case group were treated for 6 months with a combination of 200 microg of interferon gamma-1b (given three times per week subcutaneously) plus 7.5 mg of prednisolone (given once a day), while the control group received their previous conventional medications. Lung function was measured at base line and after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment.In case and control groups, Forced Expiratory Volume in first second (FEV1) did not have statistical differences at the base line (49.3 +/- 2.9 and 48.7 +/- 4.1, respectively = 0.6), whereas a significant increase was seen in the case group (66.3 +/- 5.4) compared control group (57.3 +/- 8.6) at the subsequent months (P = 0.001 for the difference between the groups). Similar pattern of increase was observed in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).The findings of this study indicate that a 6-month treatment with interferon gamma-1b plus a low-dose prednisolone is associated with an improvement in the lung function in mustard-gas exposed patients with bronchiolitis."
2017,28617535,Research on the protective effects of antioxidants on metabolic syndrome induced by thyroid dysfunction.,"This paper researches on the protective effects of antioxidants on metabolic syndrome induced by thyroid dysfunction. While the role of Lipoic acid (LA), Resveratrol (R) and Quercetin (Q) are recognized, the mechanisms for their ameliorative effects are partially understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MS among university workers and to examine the relationship with thyroid function and mechanisms for protective effects of LA, Resveratrol and Quercetin on the heart, kidneys and lungs.In the cross-sectional study, a total of 2273 university workers (1198 males and 1075 females) aged 22-60 participated. Anthropometric measurements (weight and height), blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipids, liver and kidney function tests were carried out, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and dityrosine levels were measured.A further evaluation of oxidative stress markers in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) compared with normal thyroid function showed the differences. Among middle-aged men with SCH (n = 467), MDA concentrations (8.11 ± 1.39 nmol/ml) were significantly higher euthyroid controls (7.34 ± 1.31 nmol/ml; n = 190) while AOPP, dityrosine and T-AOC levels were not different.It was demonstrated that prevalence of MS components was high. Targeting thyroid hormone restoration, inhibition of ACE and GSK3β via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway using LA, Resveratrol and Quercetin are potential novel therapeutic approaches for developing pharmaceuticals that could make significance in MS treatment."
2015,25419632,Salvianolic acid A shows selective cytotoxicity against multidrug-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells.,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause for incurable breast cancer. Salvianolic acid A (SAA), the hydrophilic polyphenolic derivative of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen/Red Sage), was examined for cytotoxicities to MDR MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and their parental counterparts. We have shown that SAA inhibited proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest at the S phase, and induced apoptosis dose dependently to the two kinds of cancer cells. However, the resistant cells were significantly susceptible to the inhibition of SAA compared with the parental cells. SAA increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 6.2-fold in the resistant cells, whereas the level of SAA-induced ROS changed only by 1.6-fold in their parental counterparts. Thus, the data showed that the selective cytotoxicity resulted from the hypersensitivity of the resistant cells to the strongly elevated ROS by SAA. In addition, SAA-triggered apoptosis was associated with increased caspase-3 activity, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, downregulated Bcl-2 expression, and upregulated Bax expression in the resistant cells. Moreover, SAA downregulated the level of P-glycoprotein, which was overexpressed in the resistant cells. This indicated that SAA modulated MDR. Furthermore, SAA showed higher antitumor activity than did doxorubicin in xenografts established from the resistant cells. The present work raised a possibility that SAA might be considered a potential choice to overcome MDR for the selective susceptibility of the resistant breast cancer cells to SAA treatment. "
1983,6869964,Influence of the estrous cycle on selected biochemical and cytologic characteristics of milk of cows with subclinical mastitis.,"The purpose in this experiment was to determine the relationship between subclinical mastitis and the estrous cycle. Subclinical mastitis was defined as a quarter in which milk had a somatic cell concentration greater than 500,000/ml and was bacteriologic culture-positive on 2 consecutive examinations. Normal quarters were defined as quarters from which milk had a somatic cell concentration less than 500,000/ml and was bacteriologic culture-negative on 2 consecutive examinations. Selected biochemical and cytologic characteristics of milk from 10 cows with subclinical mastitis were measured at 5-day intervals during the estrous cycle. Milk and blood progesterone concentrations were determined. Analysis of variance of dependent variables was performed, using a model with the following factors: cows, treatments, days of estrous cycle, and interaction of treatment with day of the estrous cycle. Treatment consisted of comparison of normal and subclinically mastitic quarters. Clinical signs of mastitis tended to occur more often during estrus (days 0 and 20) than during diestrus (day 10). Day of the estrous cycle was a significant source of variation for bovine serum albumin concentrations in milk. Somatic cell concentrations, electrical conductivity, milk bacterial concentrations, and log10 milk bacterial concentrations did not vary significantly during days of the estrous cycle. A significant treatment-by-day interaction occurred for milk progesterone concentrations; blood progesterone concentrations were not similarly affected. Milk progesterone concentrations for mastitic and normal quarters were similar at estrus (days 0 and 20) and metestrus (day 5). Milk progesterone concentrations for mastitic quarters were significantly decreased on day 15 of the estrous cycle, compared with values from normal quarters."
2006,16925582,"Effect of methotrexate treatment on expression levels of multidrug resistance protein 2, breast cancer resistance protein and organic anion transporters Oat1, Oat2 and Oat3 in rats.","The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, multidrug resistance protein 2 (Mrp2; Abcc2) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp; Abcg2), and organic anion transporters (Oats) mediate excretion of methotrexate (MTX) and many other drugs. However, it is not known whether MTX treatment leads to any changes in the expression of these transporters. We examined the effect of MTX treatment on expression of Mrp2, Bcrp and Oats in rats. MTX was single injected intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg, and then Western blot analysis was performed. The levels of Mrp2, Oat1 and Oat2 on day 1 after the treatment showed no significant change. Four days after injection of 150 mg/kg MTX, the Mrp2 levels in the liver and ileum, but not in the kidney, were markedly down-regulated to 20 +/- 3.6% and 8.9 +/- 3.8% (mean +/- SEM) of controls, respectively. Renal Oat1 and Oat3 were also down-regulated to 56.4 +/- 4.3% (Oat1) and 54.3 +/- 5.5% (Oat3) of controls. These effects of MTX were almost recovered by leucovorin which rescues normal cells from MTX toxicity. MTX treatment also decreased mRNA levels of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) to 65.5 +/- 17.9% and 59.6 +/- 14.5% of controls in the liver, respectively. MTX treatment has no apparent effect on expression levels of Bcrp, cytochrome P450 2B6 and 3A1. In conclusion, these data indicate that MTX treatment down-regulates expression levels of Mrp2, Oat1 and Oat3, and its effects are recovered by leucovorin."
2005,16236145,"Cadmium effects on brain acetylcholinesterase activity and antioxidant status of adult rats: modulation by zinc, calcium and L-cysteine co-administration.","We have previously reported that cadmium (Cd) as 3CdSO4 . 8H2O decreases rat brain total antioxidant status and L-cysteine (Cys) has a protective effect against it. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of subacute Cd administration, either alone or (almost simultaneously) with zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca) and Cys, on brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and brain total antioxidant status in male adult rats. All substances were administered intraperitoneally. Cadmium (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days) increased AChE activity (+46%; P<0.001) and decreased total antioxidant status (-29%; P<0.001). Zinc and Ca (both 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days) increased AChE activity (+18%; P<0.01 and +53%; P<0.001) and caused no changes on rat brain total antioxidant status. L-Cysteine (7 mg/kg/day for 14 days) impressively increased AChE activity (+185%; P<0.001) and augmented total antioxidant status (+26%; P<0.001). In the groups of Zn+Cd, Ca+Cd and Cys+Cd co-administration, AChE activity remained high (+42%; P<0.001, +41%; P<0.001 and +141%; P<0.001 respectively), while total antioxidant status returned to the saline control levels. L-Cysteine given before a toxic dose of Cd (5 mg/kg) resulted in high AChE activity (+85%; P<0.001), a total antioxidant status similar to the control values, and survival of the treated rats. In conclusion, Cd increased brain AChE activity and decreased brain total antioxidant status of adult male rats. Zinc, Ca and Cys, given just before Cd administration, modified the Cd-induced effects and restored rat brain total antioxidant status to the control levels."
2000,10971386,No impact of high-dose cytarabine on the outcome of patients transplanted for acute myeloblastic leukaemia in first remission. Acute Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,"High-dose cytarabine is currently used in combination with anthracycline in the treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Moreover, high-dose cytarabine has been reported to produce long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of patients, especially in certain subtypes of AML. However, it remains unknown whether the outcome of patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation is influenced by previous treatment with high-dose cytarabine. To this end, 1672 patients with AML in first remission who were reported to the Acute Leukaemia Working Party registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and who were transplanted between 1980 and 1995 were analysed according to the dose intensity of cytarabine given at induction and/or consolidation. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ABMT) was performed in 846 patients and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 826 patients. This study shows that the dose of cytarabine (Ara-C) given at induction and/or consolidation did not influence the relapse incidence in patients subsequently allografted or autografted. In addition, it did not give any advantage in terms of overall outcome. Therefore, high-dose (HD) Ara-C may not be needed for patients who have a planned stem cell transplantation (SCT) as post-remission therapy. Nevertheless, HD Ara-C may be utilized in certain subtypes of AML that are believed to be curable by chemotherapy alone."
1981,7212888,Lack of effect of fortified wine ingested during fasting and anticoagulant therapy.,"Because daily ingestion of 592 mL of table wine (12% ethanol by volume) during mealtime had no notable effect on long-term, ""therapeutic"" hypoprothrombinemia with racemic warfarin sodium in normal subjects, similar experiments were repeated using fortified wine (20% ethanol by volume) during fasting. For 21 days, seven normal subjects were given therapeutic levels of the anticoagulant racemic warfarin alone and with warfarin plus 296 mL/day of fortified wine during fasting. The blood-alcohol level of 296 mL of fortified wine ingested during fasting is equivalent to 1,646 mL of table wine ingested during mealtime. No significant difference occurred in the one-stage prothrombin activity or the plasma levels of warfarin in any subject. It is concluded that daily ingestion of fortified wine during fasting has no effect on therapeutic levels of hypoprothrombinemia of normal humans."
2003,12725453,Premenstrual syndrome.,"Premenstrual syndrome, a common cyclic disorder of young and middle-aged women, is characterized by emotional and physical symptoms that consistently occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Women with more severe affective symptoms are classified as having premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although the etiology of these disorders remains uncertain, research suggests that altered regulation of neurohormones and neurotransmitters is involved. Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder are diagnoses of exclusion; therefore, alternative explanations for symptoms must be considered before either diagnosis is made. The disorders can manifest with a wide variety of symptoms, including depression, mood lability, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, headache, and fatigue. Women with mild symptoms should be instructed about lifestyle changes, including healthy diet, sodium and caffeine restriction, exercise, and stress reduction. Supportive strategies, such as use of a symptom diary, may be helpful in diagnosing and managing the disorders. In women with moderate symptoms, treatment includes both medication and lifestyle modifications. Dietary supplements, such as calcium and evening primrose oil, may offer modest benefit. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline are the most effective pharmacologic agents. Prostaglandin inhibitors and diuretics may provide some relief of symptoms. Only weak evidence supports the effectiveness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, androgenic agents, estrogen, progesterone, or other psychotropics, and side effects limit their use."
2017,28056420,Synergistic effects of acarbose and an Oroxylum indicum seed extract in streptozotocin and high-fat-diet induced prediabetic mice.,"Prediabetes is defined as blood glucose levels above normal but below diabetes thresholds, and up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes if left untreated. Acarbose, the first FDA approved anti-prediabetes agent, has some disadvantages, such as reducing the risk of diabetes by only 36%, side effects and limited effects on complications. The aim of this study is to develop a new agent to treat prediabetes and to investigate the anti-prediabetes effects and mechanisms of acarbose and an Oroxylum indicum seed extract (OISE) in prediabetic mice. The combined drugs can reduce the dose of acarbose by 80% and reduce the risk of diabetes by 75%, which is one fold higher than acarbose monotherapy. The combined drugs showed synergistic anti-prediabetes effects and could be effective in preventing the complications of prediabetes. The combined drugs could improve glucose tolerance, improve lipid metabolism and reduce oxidative stress and tissue damage. For the mechanisms, the combined drugs can reduce synergistically postprandial hyperglycaemia by inhibiting α-glucosidase. Furthermore, baicalein in OISE was demonstrated to be a major component in reducing oxidative stress and chrysin was the primary compound that activated PPARγ."
1996,8862208,"Stability of acetazolamide, allopurinol, azathioprine, clonazepam, and flucytosine in extemporaneously compounded oral liquids.","The stability of drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied. Acetazolamide 25 mg/mL, allopurinol 20 mg/mL, azathioprine 50 mg/mL, clonazepam 0.1 mg/mL, and flucytosine 10 mg/mL were prepared in 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), and cherry syrup and placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The sources of the drugs were capsules and tablets. Six bottles were prepared per liquid; three were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. A sample was removed from each bottle initially and at intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. At least 94% of the initial drug concentration was retained in all the oral liquids for up to 60 days. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of the liquids, or in the pH. Acetazolamide 25 mg/mL, allopurinol 20 mg/mL, azathioprine 50 mg/mL, clonazepam 0.1 mg/mL, and flucytosine 10 mg/mL were stable for up to 60 days at 5 and 25 degrees C in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids."
2012,22771629,Notoginsenoside Ft1 promotes angiogenesis via HIF-1α mediated VEGF secretion and the regulation of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways.,"Notoginsenoside Ft1 (Ft1) is a saponin isolated from Panax notoginseng, which has been used traditionally for the treatment of trauma injuries in East Asia. Here we show that Ft1 is a novel stimulator of angiogenesis. The results show that Ft1 induces proliferation, migration, and tube formation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Ft1 increases translocalization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) from cytoplasm to nuclei, where it binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter, increasing the expression of VEGF mRNA and the subsequent secretion of the growth factor. Ft1 induces the activation of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Pharmacological inhibition with LY294002, wortmanin or PD98059 reduces Ft1-induced angiogenesis, indicating the important role played by these pathways. In addition, Ft1 induces phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and siRNA-mediated mTOR knockdown decreases tube formation, proliferation, transport of HIF-1α into nuclei and VEGF mRNA expression in response to Ft1. Finally, in vivo, Ft1 promotes the formation of blood vessels in Matrigel plug and wound healing in mice. Taken together, the present results reveal that Ft1 stimulates angiogenesis via HIF-1α-mediated VEGF expression, with PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades concurrently participating in the process."
,8297156,Inhibition of liver microsomal cytochrome P450 activity and metabolism of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine NNK by capsaicin and ellagic acid.,"The tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3- pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), present in tobacco and tobacco smoke, is metabolically activated by microsomal enzymes. In this study, we examined the effect of capsaicin and ellagic acid on the in vitro metabolism of NNK by hamster and rat liver microsomes. Capsaicin is the principal component of Capsicum fruits used widely throughout the world as a food additive. Ellagic acid, with reported anticarcinogenic properties, is found in various soft fruits and nuts. Both capsaicin and ellagic acid inhibited the major pathways of NNK-reduction, N-pyridine oxidation and a-hydroxylation by hamster liver microsomes. Capsaicin inhibited NNK-reduction and a-hydroxylation and ellagic acid inhibited N-oxidation and a-hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes. The effects of capsaicin and ellagic acid on isozymes of cytochrome P450 were observed in the hydroxylation reactions of the metabolism of the steroid hormone testosterone. Results of these experiments indicated that both capsaicin and ellagic acid strongly inhibited the constitutive enzymes CYP 2A2, 3A1, 2C11, 2B1, 2B2 and 2C6. This study suggests that capsaicin and ellagic acid, as naturally occurring dietary constituents, possess antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties through the inhibition of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes."
2011,21639405,The role of phytochemicals in the treatment and prevention of dementia.,"Dementia pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reaching epidemic proportions, yet they are not successfully managed by effective symptomatic treatments. Only five drugs have been developed to alleviate cognitive symptoms, and more effective and safe treatments are needed for both the cognitive symptoms and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). As two of these licensed drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors [ChEIs]) are naturally derived (galantamine and rivastigmine), the potential for plants to yield new therapeutic agents has stimulated extensive research to discover new ChEIs together with plant extracts, phytochemicals and their derivatives with other mechanistic effects relevant to dementia treatment. This review presents the potential and actual therapeutic strategies for dementia in relation to the known mechanisms of dementia pathology. Phytochemicals that have shown mechanistic effects relevant to the pathological targets in dementia are discussed, with an emphasis on those showing positive clinical trial evidence. Those phytochemicals discussed include the alkaloid physostigmine, a ChEI from the calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum), which has been used as a template for the development of synthetic derivatives that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, including the drug rivastigmine. Also discussed are other ChEI alkaloids including huperzine A, from Huperzia serrata, and galantamine, originally from the snowdrop (Galanthus woronowii); both alkaloids improve cognitive functions in AD patients. Other phytochemicals discussed include cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol) from Cannabis sativa, which are emerging as potential therapeutic agents for BPSD, and resveratrol (occurs in various plants) and curcumin (from turmeric [Curcuma longa]), which have been investigated for their pharmacological activities relevant to dementia and their potential effects on delaying dementia progression. The review also discusses plant extracts, and their known constituents, that have shown relevant mechanistic effects for dementia and promising clinical data, but require more evidence for their clinical efficacy and safety. Such plants include Ginkgo biloba, which has been extensively studied in numerous clinical trials, with most outcomes showing positive effects on cognitive functions in dementia patients; however, more reliable and consistent clinical data are needed to confirm efficacy. Other plants and their extracts that have produced promising clinical data in dementia patients, with respect to cognition, include saffron (Crocus sativus), ginseng (Panax species), sage (Salvia species) and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), although more extensive and reliable clinical data are required. Other plants that are used in traditional practices of medicine have been suggested to improve cognitive functions (e.g. Polygala tenuifolia) or have been associated with alleviation of BPSD (e.g. the traditional prescription yokukansan); such remedies are often prescribed as complex mixtures of different plants, which complicates interpretation of pharmacological and clinical data and introduces additional challenges for quality control. Evidence for the role of natural products in disease prevention, the primary but considerably challenging aim with respect to dementia, is limited, but the available epidemiological and clinical evidence is discussed, with most studies focused on ChEIs, nicotine (from Nicotiana species), curcumin, wine polyphenols such as resveratrol and G. biloba. Challenges for the development of phytochemicals as drugs and for quality control of standardized plant extracts are also considered."
2004,15467204,Induction of apoptosis by Saussurea lappa and Pharbitis nil on AGS gastric cancer cells.,"We performed this study to understand the molecular basis underlying the antitumor effects of Saussurea lappa, Pharbitis nil, Plantago asiatica and Taraxacum mongolicum, which have been used for herbal medicinal treatments against cancers in East Asia. We analyzed the effects of these medicinal herbs on proliferation and on expression of cell growth/apoptosis related molecules, with using an AGS gastric cancer cell line. The treatments of Saussurea lappa and Pharbitis nil dramatically reduced cell viabilities in a dose and time-dependent manner, but Plantago asiatica and Taraxacum mongolicum didn't. FACS analysis and Annexin V staining assay also showed that both Saussurea lappa and Pharbitis nil induce apoptotic cell death of AGS. Expression analyses via RT-PCR and Western blots revealed that Saussurea lappa, but not Pharbitis nil, increased expression of the p53 and its downstream effector p21Waf1, and that the both increased expression of apoptosis related Bax and cleavage of active caspase-3 protein. We also confirmed the translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Saussurea lappa and Pharbitis nil induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells, and these effects are correlated with down- and up-regulation of growth-regulating apoptotic and tumor suppressor genes, respectively."
1999,10530767,Effect of liquorice and glycyrrhizin on rat liver carcinogen metabolizing enzymes.,"We investigated the effect of single or repeated intake of conspicuous amounts of licorice root extract (LE, 3138 or 6276 mg/kg body weight (bw) per os) or its natural constituent glycyrrhizin (G, 240 or 480 mg/kg bw per os) on Sprague-Dawley rat liver monooxygenases. Whereas a single LE or G dose was unable to affect CYP superfamily, four daily doses induced CYP3A, CYP1A2 and to varying extents CYP2B1-linked monooxygenases. A boosting effect on testosterone 6beta- (CYP3A1/2, CYP1A1/2), 7alpha- (CYP1A1/2, CYP2A1), 16alpha- (CYP2B1, CYP2C11), 2alpha- (CYP2C11) and 2beta- (CYP3A1, CYP1A1) -dependent oxidases as well as on androst-4-ene-3,17-dione- (CYP3A1/2) -supported monooxygenases were also achieved. Harmful outcomes associated to CYP changes (e.g. cotoxicity, cocarcinogenicity and promotion) may be of concern."
2019,31036001,Papaver nudicaule (Iceland poppy) alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation through inactivating NF-κB and STAT3.,"Papaver nudicaule belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which is planted as an annual herbaceous species generally for ornamental purpose. Papaver rhoeas in the same family has been reported to have various pharmacological activities such as antioxidant and analgesic effects. In contrast, little is known about the pharmacological activity of Papaver nudicaule. In this study, the anti-inflammatory activity of Papaver nudicaule extracts and the action mechanisms were investigated in RAW264.7 macrophage cells.To investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of five cultivars of Papaver nudicaule with different flower color, samples were collected from their aerial parts at two growth stages (60 and 90 days) and their ethanol extracts were evaluated in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells by measuring nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production were also analyzed by RT-PCR and multiplex assays. Nuclear Factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways were examined using western blotting and luciferase reporter assays to reveal the action mechanism of Papaver nudicaule extracts in their anti-inflammatory activity.All of the Papaver nudicaule extracts were effective in reducing the LPS-induced NO, which is an important inflammatory mediator, and the extract of Papaver nudicaule with white flower collected at 90 days (NW90) was selected for further experiments because of the best effect on reducing the LPS-induced NO as well as no toxicity. NW90 lowered the LPS-induced PGE2 level and decreased the LPS-induced Nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). In addition, NW90 reduced the LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, NW90 inhibited the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and STAT3.These results indicate that NW90 may restrain inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB and STAT3, suggesting the potential therapeutic properties of Papaver nudicaule against inflammatory disease."
1999,10088878,Herbal remedies: adverse effects and drug interactions.,"A growing number of Americans are using herbal products for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The manufacturers of these products are not required to submit proof of safety and efficacy to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before marketing. For this reason, the adverse effects and drug interactions associated with herbal remedies are largely unknown. Ginkgo biloba extract, advertised as improving cognitive functioning, has been reported to cause spontaneous bleeding, and it may interact with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. St. John's wort, promoted as a treatment for depression, may have monoamine oxidase-inhibiting effects or may cause increased levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. Although St. John's wort probably does not interact with foods that contain tyramine, it should not be used with prescription antidepressants. Ephedrine-containing herbal products have been associated with adverse cardiovascular events, seizures and even death. Ginseng, widely used for its purported physical and mental effects, is generally well tolerated, but it has been implicated as a cause of decreased response to warfarin. Physicians must be alert for adverse effects and drug interactions associated with herbal remedies, and they should ask all patients about the use of these products."
2015,25862309,Does use of the polyene natamycin as a food preservative jeopardise the clinical efficacy of amphotericin B? A word of concern.,"Natamycin is a poorly soluble, polyene macrolide antifungal agent used in the food industry for the surface treatment of cheese and sausages. This use is not of safety concern. However, highly soluble natamycin-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes have been developed for the protection of beverages. This practice leads to high drug exposures exceeding the safety level. Apart from the definition of an acceptable daily dietary exposure to natamycin, its effect on the faecal flora as a reservoir for resistance has to be examined. Consumption of food to which natamycin has been added and mixed homogeneously, such as yoghurt, and in particular the addition of cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to beverages and wine generates high faecal natamycin concentrations resulting in high drug exposures of faecal Candida spp. Development of natamycin resistance has been observed in Candida spp. colonising the intestinal tract of patients following natamycin treatment of fungal infections. Horizontal gene transfer among different Candida spp. and within Aspergillus fumigatus spreads resistance. Therefore, it cannot be denied that use of natamycin for preservation of yoghurt and beverages may foster development of resistance to polyenes in Candida spp. "
2003,14730132,Enhancing effect of lipids and emulsifiers on the accumulation of quercetin metabolites in blood plasma after the short-term ingestion of onion by rats.,"The effects of co-ingested lipids and emulsifiers on the accumulation of quercetin metabolites in blood plasma after the short-term ingestion of onion by rats were investigated. Plasma extracts of rats that had been fed onion-containing diets for one and two weeks were analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection after a treatment with sulfatase/beta-glucuronidase. Almost all of the quercetin metabolites in the plasma were sulfate/glucuronide conjugates of quercetin and isorhamnetin. More than 4.6% (w/w) of soybean oil in the diets significantly enhanced the accumulation of quercetin metabolites in the plasma. Fish oil and beef tallow increased this to an extent similar to that with soybean oil, and lecithin was more effective than the other three lipids. Two emulsifiers, sodium caseinate and sucrose fatty acid ester, also showed an enhancing effect on the accumulation of quercetin metabolites. These results indicate that co-ingested lipids and emulsifiers could enhance the bioavailability of quercetin glucosides in onion."
1999,10330883,[Soft tissue augmentation for treatment of wrinkles and scars of the face].,"Facial wrinkles and scars can be corrected by injecting implants into the dermal connective tissue. Today, several substances can be used for this purpose. Injectable bovine collagen (Zyderm and Zyplast) has been used successfully for more than twenty years in some hundred thousand patients. Due to the xenogenity of the product a skin testing is required before augmentation. As the implant is degraded by the body's own mechanisms periodic maintenance injections are necessary. Gelatin matrix (Fibrel) was developed as an alternative to injectable collagen. It is mainly used for the correction of scars. The long term-correction seems to be better compared to collagen but a skin test must be performed as well. The most promising material for soft tissue augmentation today is hyaluronic acid and its derivatives. The substance is easy to handle and requires no previous skin testing. The efficacy is comparable to collagen. Apart from the biomaterials synthetic implants are still of interest. The augmentation with expanded polytetrafluorothylene (Gore-tex) requires a surgical procedure because a tubular implant is inserted undermeath the wrinkles. The correction is permanent, but scars and an asymmetrie of the face may be complications."
2011,20878552,Exogenously treated mammalian sex hormones affect inorganic constituents of plants.,"The present study was undertaken to reveal the changes in inorganic constituents of plants exposed to mammalian sex hormones (MSH). Chickpea leaves were sprayed with 10(-4), 10(-6), 10(-9), 10(-12), and 10(-15) M concentrations of progesterone, β-estradiol, and androsterone at 7th day after sowing. The plants were harvested at the end of 18 days after treatment of MSH solutions and the inorganic components determined using a wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy technique. At all of the concentrations tested, MSH significantly increased the contents of K, S, Na, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, P, Cu, and Ni. Interestingly, only Mn and Cl contents decreased. The maximum changes in the inorganic composition were recorded at 10(-6) M for plants treated with progesterone and 10(-9) M for plants treated with β-estradiol and androsterone."
2019,31469089,"Three-dimensional assembly of silver nanoparticles spatially confined by cellular structure of Spirulina, from nanospheres to nanosheets.","Three-dimensional (3D) ordered construction of nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted much attention in wide applications, however, techniques with respect to cost effective nanofabrication of well defined functional architectures is still lacking. To address this specific issue, a bio-interface confinement approach is proposed that precisely replicates the complex cellular structural features of microbes and integrates silver NP (SNP) building blocks into their 3D framework in a precise, low cost and mass production way. Herein, the SNPs with nanospheres and nanosheets structure were synthesized by way of electroless deposition using Spirulina as template. Results showed that SNPs were orderly assembled along the cellular structure, and the spatially confinement of cellular texture induced the transformation of SNPs from sphere to flake morphology during their continuous growth. The silver assembly not only shows good antibacterial activity, but also exhibits excellent surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance with the enhancement factor as high as 5.95 × 108 and good recuperability towards Rhodamine 6G. The fascinating SERS performance can be ascribed to the combined action of nanosheets morphology of SNPs, hierarchical nanostructure of the cellular structure, and the small interparticle spacing. This strategy provides an effective strategy for controllable and ordered 3D assembly of NPs by using the cellular texture."
2008,18806958,Synergistic immunostimulating activity of pidotimod and red ginseng acidic polysaccharide against cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression.,We investigated the synergistic effect of combined treatment with red ginseng acidic polysaccharide (RGAP) from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer and pidotimod in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The combination of pidotimod and RGAP restored concanavalin A-induced splenic T cell proliferation and LPS-stimulated B cell proliferation significantly. The production of nitric oxide from peritoneal macrophages was increased by the combinations. NK cell activity was increased by RGAP alone or in combination with pidotimod. A synergistic increase in the level of serum IL-12 and interferongamm was observed when the combination of the two was used. RGAP alone or in combination with pidotimod modulated the level of serum C-reactive protein to a near-normal level. These results indicate that combinations of pidotimod and RGAP are synergistic and suggest that combination therapy using pidotimod and RGAP for improving immune activity may provide an additional benefit over the use of the two drugs by themselves.
2003,14672873,Inhibitory effects of aqueous crude extract of Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) on chemical-induced genotoxicity in mice.,"Saffron (dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L.), was evaluated in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test for its possible protective effects against chromosomal damage induced by cisplatin (CIS), mitomycin-C (MMC) and urethane (URE). Three doses of saffron (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) were orally administered to mice for five consecutive days prior to administration of genotoxins under investigation. From the results obtained, it was evident that the administration of 50 and 100 mg saffron/kg body weight could significantly inhibit the in vivo genotoxicity of these genotoxins. However, all the three doses of saffron were effective in exerting a protective effect against urethane."
2010,19404565,Effects of high glucose and thiamine on the balance between matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in vascular cells.,"Pericyte survival in diabetic retinopathy depends also on interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which are degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Elevated glucose influences ECM turnover, through expression of MMP and their tissue inhibitors, TIMP. We reported on reduced pericyte adhesion to high glucose-conditioned ECM and correction by thiamine. We aimed at verifying the effects of thiamine and benfotiamine on MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP expression and activity in human vascular cells with high glucose. In HRP, MMP-2 activity, though not expression, increased with high glucose and decreased with thiamine and benfotiamine; TIMP-1 expression increased with high glucose plus thiamine and benfotiamine; MMP-9 was not expressed. In EC, MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression and activity increased with high glucose, but thiamine and benfotiamine had no effects; TIMP-1 expression was unchanged. Neither glucose nor thiamine modified TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 expression. TIMP-1 concentrations did not change in either HRP or EC. High glucose imbalances MMP/TIMP regulation, leading to increased ECM turnover. Thiamine and benfotiamine correct the increase in MMP-2 activity due to high glucose in HRP, while increasing TIMP-1."
2019,28853916,Vascular endothelial growth factor: An important molecular target of curcumin.,"The discovery of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), the key modulator of angiogenesis, has triggered intensive research on anti-angiogenic therapeutic modalities. Although several clinical studies have validated anti-VEGF therapeutics, with few of them approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), anti-angiogenic therapy is still in its infancy. Phytochemicals are compounds that have several metabolic and health benefits. Curcumin, the yellow pigment derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) rhizomes, has a wide range of pharmaceutical properties. It has also been shown to inhibit VEGF by several studies. In this review, we elaborate the effect of curcumin on VEGF and angiogenesis and its therapeutic application."
2015,26370834,Ameliorating effects of gypenosides on chronic stress-induced anxiety disorders in mice.,"Ethanol extract from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP) shows anti-stress and anxiolytic functions in mice, and also protects dopamine neurons in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, gypenosides (the gypenoside-enriched components of GP, GPS) have a protective effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. In this study, the ameliorating effects of GPS on chronic stress-induced anxiety disorders in mice were investigated.Mice were orally treated with GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) once a day for 10 days, followed by exposure to electric footshock (EF) stress (0.6 mA, 1 s every 5 s, 3 min). After the final administration of either GPS, water extract of GP (GP-WX) or ethanol extract of GP (GP-EX, positive control), the behavioral tests such as elevated plus-maze, marble burying and locomotor activity tests, and the biochemical parameters including dopamine, serotonin and corticosterone levels, and c-Fos expression were examined.Treatment with GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) increased the number of open arm entries and the time spent on open arms in elevated plus-maze which were reduced by chronic EF stress. GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) reduced the number of marbles buried which increased by chronic EF stress. In these states, the brain levels of dopamine and serotonin decreased by chronic EF stress and they were recovered by GPS. The serum levels of corticosterone increased by chronic EF stress were also reduced by GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg). Finally, chronic EF stress-induced c-Fos expression was markedly reduced by GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) in the brain. GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) also showed an equivalent efficacy on anxiolytic functions, as compared with GP-EX (50 mg/kg). However, GP-WX (50 mg/kg) showed a less effect on anxiety disorders than GP-EX (50 mg/kg) and GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg).These results suggest that GPS (100 and 200 mg/kg) has anxiolytic effects on chronic EF stress-induced anxiety disorders by modulating dopamine and serotonin neuronal activities, c-Fos expression and corticosterone levels. GPS may serve as a phytonutrient in chronic stress-induced anxiety disorders."
2016,27307703,Evaluation of wound healing properties of bioactive aqueous fraction from Moringa oleifera Lam on experimentally induced diabetic animal model.,"Diabetic foot ulcer is a serious complication of diabetes, which affects a significant percentage (15%) of diabetics and up to 15%-24% of those affected may require amputation. Therefore, the economic burden of diabetic foot ulcers is enormous and is associated with high cost of treatment and prolongs hospitalization. The present study was conducted to evaluate antibacterial and in vivo wound healing activities of an aqueous fraction of Moringa oleifera on a diabetic condition. Antibacterial activity testing was carried out using agar well and tube dilution techniques. The in vivo study was conducted using six groups of animals that comprise of one normal and diabetic control group each, three treatment groups of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% w/w aqueous fraction, and a positive control group (1% w/w silver sulfadiazine). Rats were induced with diabetes using a combination of streptozotocin 65 and 150 mg/kg nicotinamide daily for 2 days, and excision wounds were created and treated with various doses (0.5%, 1%, and 2% w/w aqueous fraction) daily for 21 days. Biophysical, histological, and biochemical parameters were investigated. The results of the study revealed that aqueous fraction possessed antibacterial activity through inhibition of growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli organisms. The topical application of aqueous fraction revealed enhancement of wound healing under sustained hyperglycemic condition for the duration of the experiment. This enhancement was achieved through decreased wound size, improved wound contraction, and tissue regeneration, as well as downregulation of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, and upregulation of an angiogenic marker vascular endothelial growth factor in wound tissue treated with various doses of aqueous fraction of M. oleifera. The findings suggest that aqueous fraction of M. oleifera containing Vicenin-2 active compound may accelerate wound healing in hyperglycemic condition. "
2010,20606313,Therapeutic effect of arctiin and arctigenin in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice infected with influenza A virus.,"Arctiin and its aglucone, arctigenin from the fruits of Arctium lappa L. showed potent in vitro antiviral activities against influenza A virus (A/NWS/33, H1N1) (IFV). Based on the data from time-of-addition experiments and on release tests of progeny viruses, arctigenin was assumed to interfere with early event(s) of viral replication after viral penetration into cells, and to suppress the release of progeny viruses from the host cells. Arctiin was orally effective against either IFV-inoculated normal or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated mice, being less effective as compared with oseltamivir. Noticeably, arctiin produced a larger amount of virus-specific antibody than those of control and oseltamivir in sera collected from 5-FU-treated mice. Furthermore, oral treatment of 5-FU-treated mice with arctiin did not induce any resistant viruses, although the same treatment with oseltamivir induced resistant viruses at a 50% frequency. When the combination of arctiin and oseltamivir was administered to normal mice infected with IFV, the virus yields in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and lungs were significantly reduced relative to those in the mice treated with arctiin or oseltamivir alone. Thus, monotherapy of arctiin or combined therapy of arctiin with oseltamivir would be another treatment option for influenza."
2003,14769237,Interaction between chloroquine sulphate and aqueous extract of Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) in rabbits.,"This study was carried out to investigate the effect of concurrent oral administration of aqueous leaf extract of Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) on the pharmacokinetic properties of chloroquine sulphate in experimental rabbits. The results indicated that concurrent administration of both agents resulted in a significant decrease in serum concentration, slower absorption and elimination as well as longer half-life of chloroquine sulphate. The highest relative decrease of 78.0% was recorded 4 hours after concurrent administration, while the smallest decrease (64.6%) occurred 24 hours after concurrent administration. Significant reductions were also noted in some pharmacokinetic parameters of chloroquine and included the area under the curve (71.9%), maximum serum concentration (69.8%), absorption rate constant (37.3%), elimination rate constant (53.9%), clearance rate (76.5%) and volume of distribution (47.2%). However, there was a pronounced increase in the half-life of the drug (125.7%)."
2008,18633203,[Simultaneous determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in milk by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry].,"A multiresidue method was developed for determination of nine aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, spectinomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, destomycin A, apramycin, and tobramycin) in milk by LC/MS/MS. The drugs were extracted with 0.01 mol/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate containing 2% trichloroacetic acid, and the extracted solution was cleaned on cation-exchange cartridge columns (Oasis WCX and Oasis MCX). LC separation was performed on a TSK-gel VMpak25 column (50 mmx2.0 mm i.d.) using gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Recoveries of the drugs spiked at 0.01 or 0.1 microg/g in milk ranged from 66.1 to 110.8%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 17.1%. Limits of quantification of the drugs in milk were 0.001 approximately 0.01 microg/g. This method was used for analysis of milk from a lactating cow treated for clinical mastitis with two intramammary infusions of kanamycin (KM). Milk samples were analyzed during the withdrawal times at 12-hour intervals. KM concentrations were lower than the Japanese provisional MRLs (0.4 microg/g) at 60 hours after infusion, and subsequently fell to 0.01 microg/g."
2014,24731313,"Relationships of flour solvent retention capacity, secondary structure and rheological properties with the cookie making characteristics of wheat cultivars.","The relationships of grain, flour solvent retention capacity (SRC) and dough rheological properties with the cookie making properties of wheat cultivars were evaluated. Cultivars with higher proportion of intermolecular-β-sheets+antiparallel β sheets and lower α-helix had greater gluten strength. The grain weight and diameter positively correlated with the proportion of fine particles and the cookie spread factor (SF) and negatively to the grain hardness (GH) and Na2CO3 SRC. The SF was higher in the flour with a higher amount of fine particle and with a lower Na2CO3 SRC and dough stability (DS). The breaking strength (BS) of cookies was positively correlated to lactic acid (LA) SRC, DS, peak time, sedimentation value (SV), G' and G″. Na2CO3 SRC and GH were strongly correlated. The gluten performance index showed a strong positive correlation with SV, DS, G' and G″. The water absorption had a significant positive correlation with sucrose SRC and LASRC. Cultivars with higher GH produced higher amount of coarse particles in flours that had higher Na2CO3 SRC and lower cookie SF. "
2012,22980851,Volatile organic compounds from a Tuber melanosporum fermentation system.,"A total of 59 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified from Tuber melanosporum fermentation: 53 from its fermented mycelia and 32 from the fermentation broth. Alcohol-derived compounds were predominant in both the fermentation mycelia and the broth, although long chain fatty acids and isoprenoids were, for the first time, also found in the mycelia. The intense wine bouquet properties of the broth arose from several specific flavor substances, including sulfur compounds, pyrazines, furans and jasmones. Comparing the VOCs identified in this work with those previously reported, our results are more similar to the composition of the Tuber fruiting-body than previous Tuber fermentations. The composition and accumulation of flavor volatiles (e.g., pyrazines, sulfur compounds, and esters) and major constituents (e.g., 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol) in this fermentation were significantly influenced by the sucrose concentration in the medium. The obtained information could therefore be useful in applications to convert the flavors of truffle mycelia similar to those of the fruiting-body by optimising the fermentation process."
2001,11600378,Marked potentiation of activity of beta-lactams against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by corilagin.,"We found that an extract of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi markedly reduced the MICs of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as oxacillin and cefmetazole, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We isolated the effective compound and identified it as corilagin. Corilagin reduced the MICs of various beta-lactams by 100- to 2,000-fold but not the MICs of other antimicrobial agents tested. The effect of corilagin and oxacillin was synergistic. Corilagin showed a bactericidal action when added to the growth medium in combination with oxacillin."
1992,1484350,[Pharmacological study on Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer. XIV. Effect of 70% methanolic extract from red ginseng on the cytocidal effect of mitomycin c against rat ascites hepatoma AH 130].,"The influence of the 70% methanolic extract (RMe) from Red Ginseng (a steamed and dried root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) on the antitumor activity of mitomycin C (MMC) against rat ascites hepatoma AH 130 was investigated. In the case of a solid tumor, RMe at oral doses of 200, 500 mg/kg showed an inhibitory effect, but RMe was ineffective in the case of an ascites tumor. MMC combined with RMe showed a stronger antitumor effect than MMC alone. Moreover, RMe inhibited the pulmonary metastases of the tumor cells, as well as the decrease of blood platelet counts and of the fibrinogen level induced by the infusion of the tumor cells in rats. Furthermore, RMe promoted the uptake of MMC into the tumor cells and enhanced in vitro the cytotoxicity of MMC against the cultured tumor cells."
2011,21744749,The effect of lavender oil on serum testosterone levels and epididymal sperm characteristics of formaldehyde treated male rats.,"In this study, the harmful effects of formaldehyde (FA) on serum testosterone levels and epididymal sperm characteristics were investigated. In addition, possible protective effect of lavender oil was evaluated.For this purpose, 21 adult male Wistar-Albino rats were used. The rats of group I was used as control group. The rats of group II were exposed FA (10 ppm/1 hour) for 35 days. The rats of group III inhaleted lavender oil (1 ml/1 hour) with FA.While the testosterone levels, the epididymal sperm concentration and the progressive sperm motility were significantly decreased, the abnormal sperm rate was significantly increased in FA treated group when compared to control group. However, in group III, the epididymal sperm concentration and the progressive sperm motility were significantly increased, the abnormal sperm rate was significantly decreased in comparison with the FA treated group.It can be expressed that serious damages occured via formaldehyde exposure in reproductive system and that the lavender oil had protective effects against these damages."
2006,17136324,Ursane triterpenoids inhibit atherosclerosis and xanthoma in LDL receptor knockout mice.,"In order to determine the mechanism of triterpenes, a class of secondary metabolites in plants, in modulating progression of vascular atherosclerotic lesions, we isolated three ursane triterpenoids (euscaphic acid, tormentic acid and 2alpha-hydroxyursolic acid) from aerial part of Salvia miltirrhiza Bge. and fed LDLr(-/-) mice the isolated compounds at a dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. for 24 weeks.The treated mice were raised with a cholesterol-enriched (1.25%) diet. Implying serum and aorta MCP-1 analysis, we found that all mice treated with the compounds exhibited a significant reduction of whole body and vascular inflammation.The reduction of macrophage cells' number in aortic atherosclerotic lesions suggests that triterpenes treatment results in the development of a more stable plaque phenotype. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships demonstrates that compounds with a beta-orientated hydrogen-bond forming group at C-3 exhibit more potent anti-atherogenic effect than the alpha-counterpart on the development of atherosclerosis and xanthoma. However, the biological activities of the compounds are significantly reduced when they have C-19 hydrogen-bonds.These Results suggest that down-regulation of MCP-1 is the main mechanism for antiatherogenic activity of triterpenes and MCP-1 might play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis and xanthoma."
2018,28421826,6-Gingerol improves testicular function in mice model of chronic ulcerative colitis.,"The persistent inflammation and oxidative stress at the local site in ulcerative colitis reportedly extend to the testes via systemic circulation resulting in testicular dysfunction. The influence of 6-gingerol (6G), a phenolic compound isolated from Zingiber officinale, on colitis-mediated testicular dysfunction in mice was investigated in this study. Chronic ulcerative colitis was induced in mice using 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for three cycles. Each cycle consisted of 7 consecutive days of exposure to DSS-treated water followed by 14 consecutive days of normal drinking water. 6G (100 mg/kg) or sulfasalazine (SZ; 100 mg/kg) was orally administered alone or in combination with DSS-treated water during the three cycles. SZ served as standard reference drug for colitis in this study. 6G significantly prevented the incidence of rectal bleeding, decrease in the body weight gain and colon mass index in DSS-exposed mice. 6G significantly prevented colitis-mediated decreases in luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone and decreases oxidative stress indices, pro-inflammatory cytokines and caspase-3 activity with concomitant augmentation of antioxidant enzymes activities, sperm characteristics, marker enzymes of testicular function and histoarchitecture in DSS-exposed mice. 6G exerted protective influence against ulcerative colitis-induced testicular damage via mechanisms involving its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."
2016,26934929,"Rhein 8-O-β-D-Glucopyranoside Elicited the Purgative Action of Daiokanzoto (Da-Huang-Gan-Cao-Tang), Despite Dysbiosis by Ampicillin.","Sennoside A (SA), the main purgative constituent of Daiokanzoto (da-huang-gan-cao-tang; DKT), is generally regarded as a prodrug that is transformed into an active metabolite by β-glucosidase derived from Bifidobacterium spp. It has been suggested that antibiotics would promote dysbiosis, and thereby inhibit the purgative activity of DKT. In this study, ampicillin was administered to mice for 8 d, and the changes in the SA metabolism of SA alone and of DKT were investigated. The results showed that the SA metabolism of SA singly continued to be inhibited by ampicillin, but that of DKT was activated from day 3 under the same conditions. In order to investigate the mechanism of SA metabolism activated by DKT in the mice administered ampicillin, changes in the SA metabolism were observed in the presence of rhein 8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (RG) in rhubarb and liquiritin in glycyrrhiza, both of which accelerated the SA metabolism. In fact, RG achieved an activation of SA metabolism similar to that by DKT. The purgative action of DKT, which was continued treatment of the ampicillin, was significantly greater than that by SA alone, and it was shown that RG was involved in this effect. We also analyzed changes in the intestinal microbiota before and after administration of ampicillin. No Bifidobacteria were detected throughout the treatment, but the population of Bacteroides was significantly increased after 3 d under the same conditions. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that the RG in DKT changed the function of Bacteroides and thereby allowed DKT to metabolize SA. "
1999,10442214,Effect of topically applied evening primrose oil on epidermal barrier function in atopic dermatitis as a function of vehicle.,"The aim of this study was to establish the effect on barrier function in atopic dermatitis of topical evening primrose oil in an amphiphilic and a stable water-in-oil emulsion. The studies were vehicle-controlled in two populations of 20 atopic subjects. Barrier function was assessed in terms of transepidermal water loss and stratum corneum hydration after a 4-week treatment period and a 1-week treatment-free period. A barrier function test with sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and nicotinic acid ester was also carried out. Evening primrose oil proved to have a stabilising effect on the stratum corneum barrier, but this was apparent only with the water-in-oil emulsion, not the amphiphilic emulsion. The choice of vehicle is therefore an extremely important factor in the efficacy of topically applied evening primrose oil."
2015,25053065,"Fluorescent labeling of cranberry proanthocyanidins with 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein (DTAF).","A novel methodology was developed to elucidate proanthocyanidins (PAC) interaction with extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). PAC inhibit ExPEC invasion of epithelial cells and, therefore, may prevent transient gut colonization, conferring protection against subsequent extra-intestinal infections, such as urinary tract infections. Until now PAC have not been chemically labeled with fluorophores. In this work, cranberry PAC were labeled with 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino) fluorescein (DTAF), detected by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We report single and double fluorescent-labeled PAC with one or two chlorine atoms displaced from DTAF in alkaline pH via nucleophilic substitution. Fluorescent labeling was confirmed by fragmentation experiments using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Fluorescent labeled PAC were able to promote ExPEC agglutination when observed with fluorescence microscopy. DTAF tagged PAC may be used to trace the fate of PAC after they agglutinate ExPEC and follow PAC-ExPEC complexes in cell culture assays. "
2019,30582422,Nutritional characterization of sake cake (sake-kasu) after heat-drying and freeze-drying.,"Sake cake contains rice-derived components, as well as cell components and metabolites of Aspergillus oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, the effect of food processing on sake cake (sake-kasu) ingredients was investigated. Sake cake, obtained through brewing liquefied rice, was heat-dried (HD) or freeze-dried (FD) and analyzed. There were no differences in the amounts of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamin B6, choline, betaine, nicotinic acid, β-glucan and resistant proteins in HD and FD. There was also no difference in the amount of hydrolyzed amino acids in HD and FD, but many free amino acids were observed in HD. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) was found to be abundant in FD. Meanwhile, nucleic acid-related components were found to be increased in HD, which seems to be due to the degradation of microbial metabolites. When considering the health benefits of sake cake, it is necessary to pay attention to the effects of processing method.

1998,9522962,Qualitative analysis of human milk produced by women consuming a maize-predominant diet typical of rural Mexico.,"The milk composition of women on a typical rural Mexican diet was compared with that secreted by American women, consuming a diet typical of affluent countries. Milk concentrations of free fatty acids, cholesterol, total amino acids, and selected key minerals were analyzed at 4 or 6 months postpartum. The total milk fat concentration was lower in the Otomi (22.7 +/- 6.7 mg/g milk) than in the American women (31.3 +/- 5.4 mg/g milk, p = 0.001). Although the absolute concentration did not differ, cholesterol, expressed in terms of total lipid, was higher in the Otomi milk (3.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.7 mg/g fat, p = 0.005). Saturated medium-chain (C10:0-C14:0) and unsaturated intermediate-chain fatty acids (C16:1 and C18:2) were higher in the Otomi than in the American milk (p < 0.03). The concentrations of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 were significantly lower in Otomi than in American milk. The milk concentrations of protein and nonprotein nitrogen were comparable between the two groups. The concentrations of serine, proline, cystine, methionine, and tryptophan were higher in the Otomi than in the American milk (p < 0.05-0.001). The concentrations of valine and isoleucine were significantly lower in the Otomi milk (p = 0.05). Expressed per gram of milk protein, the cystine, methionine, lysine, and tryptophan concentrations were higher, and the glutamine/glutamate, valine, isoleucine, and arginine levels were lower in the Otomi milk. The concentrations of phosphorus and copper were lower in the Otomi than in the American milk at 4 months postpartum (p = 0.05). These differences in milk fatty acid and amino acid patterns and mineral content are unlikely to affect infant growth, but may have other biological consequences yet to be ascertained."
2013,24065243,Better leukemia-free and overall survival in AML in first remission following cyclophosphamide in combination with busulfan compared with TBI.,"Cyclophosphamide combined with total body irradiation (Cy/TBI) or busulfan (BuCy) are the most widely used myeloablative conditioning regimens for allotransplants. Recent data regarding their comparative effectiveness are lacking. We analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research for 1230 subjects receiving a first hematopoietic cell transplant from a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or from an unrelated donor during the years 2000 to 2006 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR) after conditioning with Cy/TBI or oral or intravenous (IV) BuCy. Multivariate analysis showed significantly less nonrelapse mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.86; P = .007), and relapse after, but not before, 1 year posttransplant (RR = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.08-0.65; P = .006), and better leukemia-free survival (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.88; P = .003) and survival (RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52-0.88; P = .003) in persons receiving IV, but not oral, Bu compared with TBI. In combination with Cy, IV Bu is associated with superior outcomes compared with TBI in patients with AML in first CR. "
1999,10597120,Comparison of 24-hour intragastric pH using four liquid formulations of lansoprazole and omeprazole.,"The results of previous studies evaluating the effect of four liquid formulations of proton-pump inhibitors on 24-hour intragastric pH are described. Patients with a gastrostomy who were resident in a Veterans Affairs medical center or its affiliated nursing home were eligible for enrollment in one of four open-label studies in which each patient served as his own control. Patients underwent 24-hour intragastric pH studies before and after receiving seven consecutive days of one of the following liquid formulations of a proton-pump inhibitor administered once daily: omeprazole granules 20 mg in orange juice, lansoprazole granules 30 mg in orange juice, simplified omeprazole suspension 20 mg, and simplified lansoprazole suspension 30 mg. The suspensions were prepared with 10 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution. Mean intragastric pH was measured, as was the time pH stayed above 3.0 and 4.0 during the 24-hour period. Six to 14 patients participated in each study. The mean posttreatment pH was 4.9+/-0.8, 4.7+/-0.6, 4.1+/-1.5, and 5.1+/-1.1 for omeprazole granules in orange juice, lansoprazole granules in orange juice, simplified omeprazole suspension, and simplified lansoprazole suspension, respectively. Both drugs in orange juice maintained pH above 4.0 longer than 14 hours and above 3.0 for close to 20 hours, which are the levels deemed optimal for healing erosive esophagitis and duodenal ulcers, respectively. Simplified lansoprazole suspension maintained pH above those thresholds for the optimal times, but simplified omeprazole suspension did not (20 and 15 hr above 3.0, 17 and 12 hr above 4.0 for lansoprazole and omeprazole, respectively). Further development of liquid formulations of proton-pump inhibitors may have important implications for the treatment of acid-related diseases in patients, including children, who are unable to swallow capsules."
2009,19761039,Effect of Hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats.,"Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations. The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day. On day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min. Reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of Hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects. Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH), an index of oxidative stress process. Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD, CAT and GSH levels. The results of the present study suggested that Hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress."
2004,14989701,In vitro metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone by canine hair follicle cells.,"The metabolism of radioactive dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone was studied in dermal papilla cells (DPC) and dermal fibroblasts (DFB) derived from hair follicles from two different body sites (head, flank) of four male, castrated beagle dogs. Thin layer chromatography was used for separation, and autoradiography for identification of the radioactive metabolites. DHEA was metabolized mainly to 11 alpha-OH-testosterone and only to a minor extent to 11 alpha-OH-androstenedione and another unidentified metabolite. The highest percentage of metabolization of DHEA was found in DFB of the head. Testosterone was metabolized only to a minor extent (less than 10%) to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and epiandrosterone and there was no significant difference between either the two cell types or the two locations. These results clearly show that the metabolization of androgens in canine DPC and DFB is different from that observed in cells from the human hair follicle."
2006,16923224,"Replacing dietary fish oil by vegetable oils has little effect on lipogenesis, lipid transport and tissue lipid uptake in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).","In order to investigate the effects of dietary lipid sources on mechanisms involved in lipid deposition, two groups of rainbow trout were fed from first-feeding to the commercial size of 1 kg (for 62 weeks) with two diets differing only by lipid source: 100% fish oil or 100% blend of vegetable oils (55% rapeseed oil, 30% palm oil, 15% linseed oil). The activities and levels of gene expression of lipogenic enzymes (fatty acid synthetase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) in liver and of lipoprotein lipase in perivisceral adipose tissue, white muscle and liver were determined. Transport of lipid was studied by determining lipid composition of plasma and lipoprotein classes. We also examined the clearance of LDL by assaying the level of LDL receptor gene expression in several tissues. Total replacement of dietary fish oil by the blend of vegetable oils did not affect growth of rainbow trout and did not modify muscle lipid content. Hepatic lipogenesis and lipid uptake in perivisceral adipose tissue, white muscle and liver were also not modified by dietary treatments. Diets containing the blend of vegetable oils induced a decrease in plasma cholesterol and LDL. In trout fed the vegetable oils diet, expression of LDL receptor gene in the liver was down-regulated."

(bearberry leaf) on the antiallergic and antiinflammatory activities of dexamethasone ointment].,"Effects of water extract (UW-ext) from the leaf of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng (Bearberry leaf) on the antiallergic and antiinflammatory activities of dexamethasone ointment were investigated. One or 2% UW-ext ointment did not inhibit the ear swelling by picryl chloride-induced contact dermatitis (PC-CD) and carrageenin-induced paw edema. UW-ext augmented the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone ointment (0.005 or 0.025%) on these allergic and inflammatory models, but not the side effect of it. These results suggest that Bearberry leaf increases the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the allergic and inflammatory models."
1996,8600756,Effect of pH on in vitro potency of amantadine against Plasmodium falciparum.,"Amantadine is a monoprotic weak base that inhibits intraerythrocytic growth in in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum, specifically chloroquine-resistant strains. Changes in the external PH of the medium are expected to result in a shift in the relative proportion of ionized and unionized species of amantadine by virtue of the weak base characteristic of the drug, influencing passage of the drug through the membrane. The ability of amantadine to alkalinize the food vacuole was determined using the accumulation of acridine orange as a vacuolar probe. Drug sensitivity following alteration of the pH gradient was assessed using the hypoxanthine method. Amantadine was able to alkalinize the food vacuole in the millimolar range; however, since its antimalarial activity is in the micromolar range, alkalinization of the food vacuole is not the primary action of the drug. The pH of the medium profoundly influenced susceptibility to chloroquine; the log of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were linearly dependent on the external pH in both chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive strains. Log IC50 values of amantadine exhibited a linear dependence on external pH in the chloroquine-sensitive strain, but in the chloroquine-resistant strain, a nonlinear parabolic function was found with the minimum IC50 at pH 7.03. Ammonium chloride did not interfere with the antimalarial activity of amantadine. The presence of the amine group on the hydrocarbon cage is essential for the activity of amantadine in Plasmodium falciparum. These results suggest factors in addition to pH gradient are involved in the effect of amantadine, possibly interactions with membrane phospholipids."
2017,28427461,Inhibitory activities of selected Sudanese medicinal plants on Porphyromonas gingivalis and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and isolation of bioactive compounds from Combretum hartmannianum (Schweinf) bark.,"Periodontal diseases are one of the major health problems and among the most important preventable global infectious diseases. Porphyromonas gingivalis is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium which has been strongly implicated in the etiology of periodontitis. Additionally, matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) is an important factor contributing to periodontal tissue destruction by a variety of mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the selected Sudanese medicinal plants against P. gingivalis bacteria and their inhibitory activities on MMP-9.Sixty two methanolic and 50% ethanolic extracts from 24 plants species were tested for antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis using microplate dilution assay method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The inhibitory activity of seven methanol extracts selected from the 62 extracts against MMP-9 was determined by Colorimetric Drug Discovery Kit. In search of bioactive lead compounds, Combretum hartmannianum bark which was found to be within the most active plant extracts was subjected to various chromatographic (medium pressure liquid chromatography, column chromatography on a Sephadex LH-20, preparative high performance liquid chromatography) and spectroscopic methods (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)) to isolate and characterize flavogalonic acid dilactone and terchebulin as bioactive compounds.About 80% of the crude extracts provided a MIC value ≤4 mg/ml against bacteria. The extracts which revealed the highest potency were: methanolic extracts of Terminalia laxiflora (wood; MIC = 0.25 mg/ml) followed by Acacia totrtilis (bark), Ambrosia maritima (aerial part), Argemone mexicana (seed), C. hartmannianum (bark), Terminalia brownii (wood) and 50% ethanolic extract of T. brownii (bark) with MIC values of 0.5 mg/ml. T. laxiflora (wood) and C. hartmannianum (bark) which belong to combretaceae family showed an inhibitory activity over 50% at the concentration of 10 μg/ml against MMP-9. Additionally, MMP-9 was significantly inhibited by terchebulin with IC50 value of 6.7 μM.To the best of our knowledge, flavogalonic acid dilactone and terchebulin were isolated from C. hartmannianium bark for the first time in this study. Because of terchebulin and some crude extracts acting on P. gingivalis bacteria and MMP-9 enzyme that would make them promising natural preference for preventing and treating periodontal diseases."
2018,29334666,Effects of Berberine chloride on the liver of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in albino Wistar rats.,"The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effect of Berberine chloride (BC) on the liver of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rat. Diabetic rats were treated with BC (50 mg/kg b.w) or glibenclamide (6 mg/kg b.w), daily for 45 days. After BC treatment in diabetic rats, there was a significant (P < 0.05) decline in the levels of hepatic markers, lipid peroxidation markers such as lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B-p65 (phospho-NF-κB p65), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as pro-apoptotic mediators such as Bax and cytochrome c. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and vitamin C, as well as anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were observed in the liver of BC treated diabetic rats. Thus, from these findings, it can be concluded that the administration of BC notably recovered the liver from hyperglycemia induced antioxidant imbalance, inflammation and apoptosis as well as rectified the imbalance in carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes."
2016,26948633,Changes in antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity of black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) protein isolates due to germination and enzymatic digestion.,"Germination is an inexpensive process to improve the nutritional properties of legumes. The effect of germinating black bean seeds on the production of cotyledon protein hydrolysates (CPH) with antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities was analyzed in this research. After simulated enzymatic digestion, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of CPH obtained from germinated black beans was lower than that observed for raw cotyledons. There were no significant differences among CPH cellular antioxidant activities (CAA), except for the high CAA of the 120 min hydrolysate obtained from one day germinated black bean cotyledons. The most significant changes due to germination and enzymatic hydrolysis were observed for the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages. The NO synthesis inhibition observed for raw CPH was reduced after simulated gastrointestinal digestion but for germinated samples the inhibition was doubled. Peptides derived from cell wall proteins produced during germination could be responsible of antiinflammatory activity."
2016,27847209,"In-vivo study for anti-hyperglycemic potential of aqueous extract of Basil seeds (Ocimum basilicum Linn) and its influence on biochemical parameters, serum electrolytes and haematological indices.","The study introduced anti-hyperglycemic influence of aqueous extract of Ocimum basilicum seeds (AEOBS) in Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats and estimating its potential to ameliorate altered level of biochemical parameters, serum electrolytes level and haematological indices along with its effect on body weight of treated rats. The albino rats were selected to observe oral glucose tolerance test by oral intake of aq. glucose solution (4g/kg, body weight) in normal rats and estimation of blood glucose level after administration of AEOBS at 250mg/kg, 500mg/kg and standard drug glibenclamide at 0.6mg/kg, body weight. Antidiabetic activity was evaluated in chronic study models by STZ induced diabetes in rats followed by blood glucose estimation. Chronic study model was selected to carry out further studies to evaluate the effect of AEOBS at 250mg/kg, 500mg/kg and standard drug on body weight, alterations in biochemical parameters including AST, ALT, ALP, total bilirubin and total protein, alterations in serum electrolytes like Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3- along with estimation of haematological indices like red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and basophils. AEOBS significantly reduced the blood glucose level of diabetic rats at both doses. Body weight was also improved significantly. Similarly, the levels of biochemical parameters, serum electrolytes, and haematological indices were significantly ameliorated at both doses of AEOBS. The histopathological results revealed reconstitution of pancreatic islets towards normal cellular architecture in rats treated with AEOBS. The results illustrated that AEOBS have eminent antidiabetic potential in STZ effectuated diabetes in rats and can be extensively used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus-II and its associated complications including anaemia, diabetic nephropathy, liver dysfunction, and immunosuppression."
2018,30270328,Anti-cataract Effect of Resveratrol in High-Glucose-Treated Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.,"Resveratrol, which is a polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, and other plants, has health benefits for various chronic diseases. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of resveratrol on cataract formation in diabetic rats. Male Wistar rats (7-week-old) were treated with streptozotocin, and the streptozotocin-treated animals were administered 5% D-glucose in drinking water to promote the formation of cataracts by inducing severe hyperglycemia. Resveratrol supplementation (10 or 30 mg/kg/d) in drinking water was initiated immediately after induction of diabetes was confirmed. The full lens images of the horizontal plane were captured with the digital camera system which we developed. Cataract formation was assessed by an observer-based scoring method and by quantitative analysis of digital images of the lens. Cataracts at the peripheral region of the lens were detected 2 weeks after induction of hyperglycemia and progressed depending on the length of the diabetic period. The majority of them developed severe cataracts after 9 weeks of hyperglycemia. Resveratrol did not prevent the appearance of diabetic cataracts but significantly delayed the progression of cataracts compared with controls. The contents of sorbitol and protein carbonyls in lenses of diabetic rats were higher than those of control rats. Resveratrol suppressed the increase in protein carbonyls, but not of sorbitol, in diabetic lenses. These results suggest that resveratrol delays the progression of diabetic cataracts partially through attenuation of oxidative damage to lens proteins. Resveratrol may be beneficial in preventing the progression of diabetic cataracts."
1995,7725372,Immunoreactivity of endogenous digitalis-like substances in cord blood sera studied with antidigitoxin monoclonal antibodies.,"The presence of digitoxin-like immunoreactive substances, whose nature is yet unknown, has been demonstrated in the umbilical cord blood. We selected six antidigitoxin monoclonal antibodies (MAb) having different specificity profiles concerning digitoxin analogs and steroid hormones. These antibodies were tested in a digitoxin radioimmunoassay (RIA). With the help of this technique, we measured the concentrations of apparent digitoxin in the cord blood drawn either at birth or in utero from mothers not undergoing any digitalis treatment. In the cord blood of newborns, the concentrations of apparent digitoxin, measured by the two MAbs that have the highest cross-reactions with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (123A23 and 145A41), were two or three times higher than with the other antibodies. In the fetal cord blood, where the concentration of DHEA is five to seven times lower than that observed at birth, these antibodies revealed a threefold lower concentration of apparent digitoxin than that observed in blood drawn at birth. Furthermore, MAbs that had similar specificities towards digitoxin analogs and steroids showed different measurements of digitoxin-like concentrations. These observations suggest that digitoxin-like immunoreactive compounds detected by the RIA may constitute a group of different molecules, one of which would be the DHEA."
1995,8546287,The influence of anaesthetic technique upon the immune response to hysterectomy. A comparison of propofol infusion and isoflurane.,"Earlier studies on propofol have shown increased percentages of T helper cells after minor surgery. In this study, the effects of propofol infusion anaesthesia on the immune response were compared with those of combined isoflurane anaesthesia in 30 patients (median age 47 years, ASA 1-2) undergoing major surgery. The total dose of propofol in the propofol infusion group of 15 women was 860 mg (range 540-1520 mg) and the median end-expiratory isoflurane concentration in the combined isoflurane group of 15 women was 0.6% (range 0.5-0.8). The following were measured; leucocyte and differential counts; percentages of lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16 and HLA-DR+CD3); phytohaemagglutinin-, concanavalin A-, and pokeweed mitogen-induced and unstimulated lymphocyte proliferation; plasma interleukin-6; serum group II phospholipase A2, C-reactive protein and cortisol concentrations. Measurements were made pre-operatively, at the end of the operation and on the first and fifth postoperative days. No statistically significant overall differences were observed in the immune response between the groups. The serum cortisol response was weaker in the propofol group than in the isoflurane group (p < 0.05). Time-related changes were seen within the groups."
2016,26593602,Extraction of bioactive carbohydrates from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) external bracts using microwave assisted extraction and pressurized liquid extraction.,"Microwave assisted extraction (MAE) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) methods using water as solvent have been optimized by means of a Box-Behnken and 3(2) composite experimental designs, respectively, for the effective extraction of bioactive carbohydrates (inositols and inulin) from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) external bracts. MAE at 60 °C for 3 min of 0.3 g of sample allowed the extraction of slightly higher concentrations of inositol than PLE at 75 °C for 26.7 min (11.6 mg/g dry sample vs. 7.6 mg/g dry sample). On the contrary, under these conditions, higher concentrations of inulin were extracted with the latter technique (185.4 mg/g vs. 96.4 mg/g dry sample), considering two successive extraction cycles for both techniques. Both methodologies can be considered appropriate for the simultaneous extraction of these bioactive carbohydrates from this particular industrial by-product. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that these techniques are applied for this purpose."
2012,22634503,Modulation of arsenic-induced epidermal growth factor receptor pathway signalling by resveratrol.,"Arsenic (As) is both a human carcinogen and an effective anticancer drug. These aspects of arsenic toxicity develop as a consequence of arsenic-induced oxidative stress and modifications to signal pathway activity which alter gene expression. Resveratrol (RVL) a food antioxidant found in grapes and other fruits, exhibits anti-carcinogenic properties by reducing oxidative stress and restoring signal pathway control. This study investigated the impact of RVL on arsenite [As(III)]-induced cell signalling in HaCaT keratinocytes by assaying phosphorylation status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling intermediates and measuring changes in expression of Phase II and DNA repair biomarkers. As(III) exposure produced dose-dependent toxicity which was associated with increased activation of EGFR pathway intermediates, cSrc, Rac1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Arsenic-mediated ERK1/2 activation negatively regulated DNA polymerase beta expression and up regulated heme-oxygenase-1 at toxic concentrations. RVL treatment modulated As(III)-mediated ERK1/2 activation by shifting the balance of cSrc regulatory domain phosphorylation. These effects significantly altered the response of the EGFR pathway to growth factor-induced stimulation. Our research provides evidence that treatment with pharmacologically relevant doses of RVL influences cellular responses to As(III), largely due to RVL-mediated changes to Src and ERK1/2 activation."
2017,28274411,Alternative natural seasoning to improve the microbial stability of low-salt beef patties.,"The meat industry is seeking new strategies to reduce the sodium content of meat products without shortening their shelf-life. Natural seasonings as salt alternatives are more appreciated than chemical preservatives and also enable the incorporation of interesting nutrients. The present work studies the potential of a new red wine pomace seasoning (RWPS), derived from wine pomace, to inhibit spoilage growth in beef patties with different salt levels (2%, 1.5% and 1%) held in storage at 4°C. The use of RWPS (2% w/w) improved the microbial stability of the patties, delaying total aerobic mesophilic, and lactic acid bacteria growth, especially in samples with low salt levels. Satisfactory results were obtained in modified-atmosphere and air-packaged patties. RWPS also enabled the incorporation of fiber and phenolic compounds, and increased potassium and calcium levels. In summary, RWPS presented an interesting potential as a seasoning in meat products, enabling salt reduction without compromising their microbial stability."
2017,29053606,Lung Toxicity of Condensed Aerosol from E-CIG Liquids: Influence of the Flavor and the In Vitro Model Used.,"The diffusion of e-cigarette (e-CIG) opens a great scientific and regulatory debate about its safety. The huge number of commercialized devices, e-liquids with almost infinite chemical formulations and the growing market demand for a rapid and efficient toxicity screen system that is able to test all of these references and related aerosols. A consensus on the best protocols for the e-CIG safety assessment is still far to be achieved, since the huge number of variables characterizing these products (e.g., flavoring type and concentration, nicotine concentration, type of the device, including the battery and the atomizer). This suggests that more experimental evidences are needed to support the regulatory frameworks. The present study aims to contribute in this field by testing the effects of condensed aerosols (CAs) from three main e-liquid categories (tobacco, mint, and cinnamon as food-related flavor), with (18 mg/mL) or without nicotine. Two in vitro models, represented by a monoculture of human epithelial alveolar cells and a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture of alveolar and lung microvascular endothelial cells were used. Cell viability, pro-inflammatory cytokines release and alveolar-blood barrier (ABB) integrity were investigated as inhalation toxicity endpoints. Results showed that nicotine itself had almost no influence on the modulation of the toxicity response, while flavor composition did have. The cell viability was significantly decreased in monoculture and ABB after exposure to the mints and cinnamon CAs. The barrier integrity was significantly affected in the ABB after exposure to cytotoxic CAs. With the exception of the significant IL-8 release in the monoculture after Cinnamon exposure, no increase of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) release was observed. These findings point out that multiple assays with different in vitro models are able to discriminate the acute inhalation toxicity of CAs from liquids with different flavors, providing the companies and regulatory bodies with useful tools for the preliminary screening of marketable products."
2008,18358599,"Anti-tumor actions of major component 3'-O-acetylhamaudol of Angelica japonica roots through dual actions, anti-angiogenesis and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte activation.","We recently demonstrated that two chalcones isolated from Angelica keiskei roots have anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities through the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, but the anti-tumor substances of Angelica japonica roots are unknown. We attempted to clarify the anti-tumor action and its mechanisms of a major component 3'-O-acetylhamaudol isolated from A. japonica roots. We first examined the effects of 3'-O-acetylhamaudol on tumor growth in colon 26-bearing mice. Furthermore, we examined the effects of 3'-O-acetylhamaudol on angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression in tumors). 3'-O-Acetylhamaudol (25 and 50 mg/kg, twice daily) inhibited the tumor growth in colon 26-bearing mice. Although 3'-O-acetylhamudol had no effect on the VEGF production and HIF-1alpha in colon 26 cells, it (10 microM) inhibited the VEGF-induced angiogenesis and VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in HUVECs. 3'-O-Acetylhamaudol has anti-tumor effects mediated through dual mechanisms, i.e., anti-angiogenic actions and the modulation of the immune system in the spleen and small intestine in tumor-bearing mice."
2016,27608856,"The Korean herbal medicine, Do In Seung Gi-Tang, attenuates atherosclerosis via AMPK in high-fat diet-induced ApoE(-/-) mice.","Do In Seung Gi-Tang (DISGT) is an herbal mixture of traditional Korean medicine that is composed of Rheum undulatum Linne, Prunus Persica (L.) Batsch, Conyza canadensis L., Cinnamomum Cassia Presl, and Glycytthiza uralensis Fischer (8: 6: 4: 4: 4 ratio). We investigated the effect of DISGT on vascular inflammation and lipid accumulation in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice.ApoE(-/-) mice that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with DISGT (300 mg/kg/day) or statin (10 mg/kg/day) for 16 weeks. Serum lipid levels were analyzed. Oil Red O staining was used to evaluate atherosclerotic lesions and lipid accumulation in the aorta and liver, respectively. The expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], and E-selectin), fatty acid synthase (FAS), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) in the aorta or liver tissues was measured by western blot analysis. Lipid synthesis and inflammatory responses were assessed by immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin & eosin staining, respectively.Treatment of HFD-fed mice with DISGT significantly lowered body weight, liver weight, and the levels of lipids, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Glucose levels were also lowered. In the aorta, DISGT attenuated atherosclerotic lesions and reduced the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Moreover, DISGT decreased lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and FAS levels, and it activated AMPK and reduced ACC expression in liver tissues.The beneficial, anti-lipolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects of DISGT were mediated by the AMPK pathway. As a result, the expression of inflammatory factors was reduced. Our data provide evidence that DISGT may have strong therapeutic potential in treating vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis."
2001,11749812,Chemo- and radio-protective effects of polysaccharide of Spirulina platensis on hemopoietic system of mice and dogs.,"To observe polysaccharide of Spirulina platensis (PSp) on the hematopoietic system of mouse and dogs which were damaged by injection of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and 60Co-gamma irradiation.CTX and 60Co gamma ray were used to induce bone marrow damage, and the experimental animals were ig with different dose of PSp in vivo, after 12-d and 21-d administration, the whole blood cells and nucleated cells in bone marrow were measured, and the DNA in bone marrow were inspected by UV-spectrophotometer.CTX and 60Co-gamma irradiation induced hemopoietic system damage in mice and dogs, respectively. PSp 30, 60 mg/kg increased the level of the white cells in blood and nucleated cells and DNA in bone marrow in mice but had no effects on red cells and hemoglobins. PSp 12 mg/kg increased the level of red cells, white cells, and hemoglobins in blood and nucleated cells in bone marrow in dogs (P < 0.01), and the effects of PSp 60 mg/kg were better than that of berbamine hydrochloride 60 mg/kg.PSp has chemo-protective and radio-protective capability, and may be a potential adjunct to cancer therapy."
2003,14504132,Activation and proliferation signals in primary human T lymphocytes inhibited by ergosterol peroxide isolated from Cordyceps cicadae.,"Effects of ergosterol peroxide (C28H44O3; Cpd 6A) from Cordyceps cicadae on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cell proliferation were studied in primary human T cells. The results showed that Cpd 6A suppressed T-cell proliferation for about 24 h after stimulation with PHA. Cell cycle analysis indicated that Cpd 6A arrested the cell cycle progression of activated T cells from the G1 transition to the S phase. To localize the point in the cell cycle where arrest occurred, a set of key regulatory events leading to the G1/S boundary, including the expression of cyclins D2, E, A1, and B1, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and activating protein-1 (AP-1), was examined. Cpd 6A suppressed, in activated T lymphocytes, the production and mRNA expression of cyclin E, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of AP-1 proteins, consisting of c-Fos and c-Jun, in activated T lymphocytes was decreased by Cpd 6A. The kinetic study indicated that the inhibitory effects of Cpd 6A on IL-2 mRNA expressed in T cells might be related to blocking c-Fos protein synthesis. T-cell proliferation after Cpd 6A treatment was partially restored by addition of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. These suppressant effects of Cpd 6A on T-cell proliferation, activated by PHA, appeared to be mediated, at least in part, through the inhibition of early gene transcripts, especially those of cyclin E, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4, and by arresting cell cycle progression in the cells."
2019,31090920,Reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation for younger patients with myelofibrosis.,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a curative procedure for myelofibrosis. Elderly people are mainly affected, limiting the feasibility of myeloablative regimens. The introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) made alloSCT feasible for older patients. Nevertheless, the incidence of myelofibrosis is not negligible in young patients, who are theoretically able to tolerate high-intensity therapy. Very few data are available about the efficacy of RIC-alloSCT in younger myelofibrosis patients. This study included 56 transplanted patients aged <55 years. Only 30% had a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor, the others were transplanted from a fully-matched (36%) or partially-matched (34%) unrelated donor. All transplants were conditioned according the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation protocol: busulfan-fludarabine + anti-thymocyte globulin, followed by ciclosporin and mycophenolate. One patient experienced primary graft failure. Incidence of graft-versus-host disease grade II-IV was 44% (grade III/IV 23%). One-year non-relapse mortality was 7% and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 19%. After a median follow-up of 8·6 years, the estimated 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) was 68% and 82%, respectively. Patients with fully-matched donor had a 5-year OS of 92%, in contrast to 68% for those with a mismatched donor (P = 0·03). The most important outcome-determining factor is donor HLA-matching. In conclusion, RIC-alloSCT ensures optimal engraftment and low relapse rate in younger myelofibrosis patients, enabling the possibility of cure in this group."
2018,29222649,Effect of Oral Zinc Supplementation on the Thiol Oxido-Reductive Index and Thiol-Related Enzymes in Seminal Plasma and Spermatozoa of Iraqi Asthenospermic Patients.,"A thiol group plays an essential role in sperm metabolism and the antioxidative defense state. Zinc is the second most abundant element in the human body, following iron. The present study was conducted to study the effect of zinc supplementation on the characteristics of semen along with thiol and thiol-related enzymes in semen of asthenospermic patients. Semen samples were obtained from 60 fertile and 60 asthenospermic men, from couples who had consulted the infertility clinic of Babil Hospital (Hillah city, Iraq). The subfertile group was treated with zinc; every participant took two 220 mg capsules of zinc sulfate per day for 3 months. Semen samples were obtained (before and after zinc supplementation). The levels of reduced thiol, oxidized thiol, thiol oxido-reductive index, and thiol-related enzymes activities were determined in spermatozoa and seminal plasma of patients and healthy groups. Oxidized thiol levels were significantly higher in the infertile patients compared to that in the fertile group. Conversely, reduced thiol level, sulfhydryl oxidase activity, and glutathione peroxidase activity significantly decreased in the infertile patients compared to that in the fertile group. Oxidized thiol levels, reduced thiol levels, and thiol-related enzymes activities of the infertile patients were restored to normal values after treatment with zinc. However, reduced and oxidized thiol levels in spermatozoa did not change significantly in the group treated with zinc. The quantitative values for RSH/RSSR and thiol-related enzymes may provide useful means to qualitatively express the oxidant/antioxidant balance in clinical and epidemiologic studies. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02985905."
1983,6614680,Oral zinc therapy for Wilson's disease.,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation that is fatal if untreated. Because penicillamine, the established treatment, is toxic in a substantial number of patients, we studied the efficacy of zinc treatment. We induced a negative or neutral copper balance in five out of five patients with Wilson's disease who were receiving no therapy other than zinc. Zinc acetate was given every 4 hours during the day, and the patient was not allowed to eat for 1 hour before and 1 hour after each dose. Oral zinc therapy, used according to our regimen, may now be considered in the treatment of patients with penicillamine intolerance. However, it is premature to convert patients to zinc therapy if they tolerate penicillamine well. The efficacy of zinc therapy in the initial removal of the copper burden in acutely ill patients with Wilson's disease has not yet been evaluated."
2005,15927932,Antioxidant properties of Momordica Charantia (bitter gourd) seeds on Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.,"The aim of the present study is to investigate the antioxidant activities of the aqueous extract of seeds of two varieties, namely a country and hybrid variety of Momordica charantia (MCSEt1 and MCSEt2) respectively in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of both the seed extracts at a concentration of 150 mg/kg b.w for 30 days showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose, hepatic and renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides. The treatment also resulted in a significant increase in reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats. The results clearly suggest that seeds of Momordica charantia treated group may effectively normalize the impaired antioxidant status in streptozotocin induced-diabetes than the glibenclamide treated groups. The extract exerted rapid protective effects against lipid peroxidation by scavenging of free radicals there by reducing the risk of diabetic complications. The effect was more pronounced in MCSEt1 compared to MCSEt2."
2017,28655305,Effect of pomegranate extracts on brain antioxidant markers and cholinesterase activity in high fat-high fructose diet induced obesity in rat model.,"To investigate beneficial effects of Pomegranate seeds oil (PSO), leaves (PL), juice (PJ) and (PP) on brain cholinesterase activity, brain oxidative stress and lipid profile in high-fat-high fructose diet (HFD) induced-obese rat.In vitro and in vivo cholinesterase activity, brain oxidative status, body and brain weight and plasma lipid profile were measured in control rats, HFD-fed rats and HFD-fed rats treated by PSO, PL, PJ and PP.In vitro study showed that PSO, PL, PP, PJ inhibited cholinesterase activity in dose dependant manner. PL extract displayed the highest inhibitory activity by IC50 of 151.85 mg/ml. For in vivo study, HFD regime induced a significant increase of cholinesterase activity in brain by 17.4% as compared to normal rats. However, the administration of PSO, PL, PJ and PP to HDF-rats decreased cholinesterase activity in brain respectively by 15.48%, 6.4%, 20% and 18.7% as compared to untreated HFD-rats. Moreover, HFD regime caused significant increase in brain stress, brain and body weight, and lipid profile disorders in blood. Furthermore, PSO, PL, PJ and PP modulated lipid profile in blood and prevented accumulation of lipid in brain and body evidenced by the decrease of their weights as compared to untreated HFD-rats. In addition administration of these extract protected brain from stress oxidant, evidenced by the decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Protein carbonylation (PC) levels and the increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels.These findings highlight the neuroprotective effects of pomegranate extracts and one of mechanisms is the inhibition of cholinesterase and the stimulation of antioxidant capacity."
2015,25683332,"Arsenite stress variably stimulates pro-oxidant enzymes, anatomical deformities, photosynthetic pigment reduction, and antioxidants in arsenic-tolerant and sensitive rice seedlings.","Contamination of arsenic (As) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddies and subsequent uptake by rice plants is a serious concern, because rice is a staple crop for millions of people. Identification of As toxicity and detoxification mechanisms in paddy rice cultivars would help to reduce As-associated risk. Arsenic tolerance and susceptibility mechanisms were investigated in 2 differential As-accumulating rice genotypes, Triguna and IET-4786, selected from initial screening of 52 rice cultivars as an As-tolerant and an As-sensitive cultivar, respectively, on the basis of root and shoot length during various arsenite (AsIII) exposures (0-50 μM). Indicators of oxidative stress, such as pro-oxidant enzymes (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase and ascorbate oxidase) and nitric oxide, were more numerous in the sensitive cultivar than in the tolerant cultivar. Arsenic-induced anatomical deformities were frequent in the sensitive cultivar, showing more distorted and flaccid root cells than the tolerant cultivar. Chlorophyll and carotenoid synthesis were inhibited in both cultivars, although the decline was more prominent in the sensitive cultivar at higher doses of As. Furthermore, the tolerant cultivar tolerated As stress by producing more antioxidants, such as proline, sustaining the ratio of ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity as well as As detoxifying enzymes arsenate reductase, whereas these respective metabolic activities declined in sensitive cultivar, resulting in greater susceptibility to As toxicity."
2005,15635159,Proteoglycans released from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cell layers by sodium spirulan are both perlecan and biglycan.,"Sodium spirulan (Na-SP) is a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from the blue-green alga Spirulina platensis. Na-SP has anticoagulant and fibrinolytic properties in vitro, including activation of heparin cofactor II, enhancement of vascular endothelial cell fibrinolytic activity and stimulation of endothelial proteoglycan (PG) release. In the present study, we investigated the types of endothelial PGs whose release is stimulated by Na-SP. Na-SP stimulated the PG release in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, heparin, dextran sulfate and hyaluronan stimulated the release of heparan sulfate PGs rather than chondroitin/dermatan sulfate PGs, whereas the release of both types of PGs was strongly stimulated by Na-SP. Sepharose CL-6B chromatography of [35S]sulfate-labeled PGs showed that PGs were partially released after partial degradation of the core proteins without a change in chain length of the glycosaminoglycan chains after Na-SP treatment. On the other hand, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis of the PG core proteins indicated that the Na-SP-releasable PGs are both a large heparan sulfate PG, perlecan, and a small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate PG, biglycan, without change in the size of the core proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that Na-SP stimulates the endothelial release of both perlecan and biglycan with the intact structures, possibly by mechanisms different from those of heparin, dextran sulfate and hyaluronan; a part of the PG core proteins may be degraded after Na-SP treatment. Since perlecan and biglycan have antithrombin activities, the present data support the hypothesis that Na-SP may enhance local anticoagulant activity in the liquid phase on the endothelium via stimulation of endothelial PG release."
2000,10840163,Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) in human head and neck cancer cells.,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but the mechanism of their regulation is not clearly understood. Recently, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to be associated with cancer invasion and metastasis. We hypothesized that GM-CSF may upregulate MMP-2 and/or MT1-MMP expression in HNSCC cells, and may thereby influence their ability to invade and metastasize. We studied the effects of GM-CSF on the production of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in HNSCC cell lines SAS and HSC-2. Gelatin zymography of conditioned media derived from HNSCC cells revealed a major band of 68 kDa, which was characterized as proMMP-2. GM-CSF stimulated the production of proMMP-2 in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF for 24 h increased the proMMP-2 activity 3.4-fold in SAS cells and 2.3-fold in HSC-2 cells compared with untreated controls. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that GM-CSF led to elevated mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in both cell lines. The results identify GM-CSF as a regulator of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression in certain types of HNSCC, and suggest that GM-CSF may contribute to the invasiveness of HNSCC through the regulation of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression."
2015,25348868,Protective effects of resveratrol oligomers from Vitis amurensis against sodium nitroprusside-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.,"Nitric oxide (NO) induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, and has been implicating in a variety of neuronal pathological process. Thus, there is much interest in identifying natural substances which have protective effects against damage induced by nitrosative stress. The roots of Vitis amurensis have been used as traditional medicine and contain structurally diverse resveratrol oligomers with various biological activities. However, there have been few studies on the protective effect of resveratrol oligomers against neurotoxic reactive nitrogen species. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of two resveratrol oligomers from V. amurensis, vitisin A and heyneanol A, against NO-induced toxicity. Additionally, their antioxidant activities were determined by measuring NO and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability. Both vitisin A and heyneanol A reduced cell death and DNA fragmentation induced by sodium nitroprusside in SH-SY5Y cells. The present study indicates that radical scavenging activities of vitisin A and heyneanol A contribute to protecting neuronal cells against nitrosative stress. "
2009,19376089,Zinc supplementation attenuates ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced liver stellate cell activation by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by influencing intracellular signaling.,"Zinc has been reported to prevent and reverse liver fibrosis in vivo; however, the mechanisms of its action are poorly understood. We therefore aimed to determine the antifibrotic potential of zinc.Assessed was the influence of preincubation of rat HSCs with 30 microM ZnCl2 on ethanol- (in the presence of 4-methyl pyrazole (4-MP)) or acetaldehyde-induced toxicity, apoptosis, migration, expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (alpha-SMA) and procollagen I, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) production. Intracellular signals such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) induced by ethanol and its metabolite were also assessed.30 microM zinc protected HSCs against ethanol and acetaldehyde toxicity and inhibited their apoptosis. Zinc inhibited the production of ROS by HSCs treated with ethanol and acetaldehyde and inhibited their migration. Zinc also inhibited ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha production. Zinc down-regulated ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced production of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and decreased the activity of MMP-2. In ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced HSCs, zinc inhibited the activation of the p38 MAPK as well as the JNK transduction pathways and phosphorylation of IkappaB and Smad 3.The results indicated that zinc supplementation inhibited ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced activation of HSCs on different levels, acting as an antioxidant and inhibitor of MAPK, TGF-beta and NFkappaB/IkappaB transduction signaling. The remarkable inhibition of several markers of HCS activation makes zinc a promising agent for antifibrotic combination therapies."
2006,20021015,Development of functional fish feed with natural ingredients to control heavy metals.,"The effects of two natural ingredients, Chinese parsley (CP) and chitosan (CT), on growth, accumulation, and excretion of cadmium in fish body and preservation of essential trace metals in the body were investigated by using rainbow trout that had been fed cadmium-added diet, low and high concentration, for 3 weeks. This pretest confirmed that cadmium was accumulated in the liver, kidney, and intestine of the test fish. The cadmium level of the fish, fed diet with CP or CT, was decreased by 18% and 24%, respectively, compared to that of the fish given the control diet. But CP and CT did not have an influence on normal growth of test fish and the levels of essential trace metals in the body. In addition, the level of cadmium was higher in liver than kidney in the high-cadmium dietary group, indicating the Cd level in kidney follows that of liver as kidney lies in the final stage of metabolism. The cadmium accumulation in the fish body was supposed to be reduced, by giving CP to increase the solubility of Cd to body fluid by conjugation into metallothioneins (MTs), while CT was supposed to be responsible for the physical adsorption of cadmium ions by glucosamine groups."
2016,27278683,Interaction of Citrus Juices with Cyclosporine: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant with narrow therapeutic window, metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and minimally by cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5). Citrus juices such as grapefruit juice (GFJ), orange, lemon, pomelo and lime were known to interact with cyclosporine in several randomized controlled trials. The present review is a systematic compilation and quantitative synthesis on the changes of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics with concomitant citrus juice administration.Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of any citrus juice on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine comparing with water or placebo in healthy volunteers using appropriate search strategies. Percent mean difference with standard error was used to assess the magnitude of difference in the following outcome measures: area under curve from time of drug administration to 24 h (AUC0-24), area under curve from time of drug administration to infinity (AUC0-∞), maximum concentration (C max), time to achieve C max (T max), elimination half-life (T 1/2), clearance (CL), volume of distribution and frequency for adverse drug reactions following administration of cyclosporine. RevMan 5.3 software was used to assess heterogeneity (by I2 statistics), use random-effects model and generate pooled results and Forest plot.A total of 57 studies were obtained with the search strategy, of which seven were found eligible to be included in the present review. The pooled percent mean difference [95 % CI] for GFJ in comparison to controls for AUC0-24, AUC0-∞, C max and T max of cyclosporine was observed to be 53 [43, 64], 53 [45, 62], 24 [12, 36] and 19 [12, 26], respectively. Similarly, pomelo juice was found to significantly increase both AUC0-∞ and C max with the pooled percent mean difference [95 % CI] as 23 [13, 32] and 25 [1, 50], respectively but decrease T 1/2 {-8 [-15, -1]} of cyclosporine. Orange juice did not alter any of the pharmacokinetic parameter of cyclosporine significantly.Citrus juices especially GFJ and pomelo juice were found to significantly increase the plasma exposure of cyclosporine while orange juice did not exhibit any significant interaction with cyclosporine."
2016,27754445,L-Asparaginase Isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris Seeds Exhibited Potent Anti-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Effects In-Vitro and Low Immunogenic Properties In-Vivo.,"Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginases have been used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, clinical hypersensitivity reactions and silent inactivation due to antibodies against E. coli-asparaginase, lead to inactivation of these preparations in most cases.Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity and antitumor effects ofa novel L-asparaginaseenzyme, isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris seeds (P-Asp) on the ALL cell line (Jurkat). The immunogenicity of the enzyme was also evaluated in-vivo and results were compared to commercially available enzymes of microbial sources. The data demonstrated that P-Asp has an enhanced anti-proliferative effect on ALL cells as detected by the WST-8 cell viability assay kit. Cells treated with P-Asp also exhibited a higher degree of early apoptosis compared with asparaginase from Escherichia coli (L-Asp) or its pegylated form Pegasparagas (PEG-ASP) that induced higher rates of late apoptosis and necrosis as detected by an Annexin V/Propidium iodide binding assay. In-vivo experiments indicated that mice treated with P-Asp had less distinct allergenic responses than other bacterial enzyme preparations as indicated by lower serum concentrations of IgG, IgE, IgM and mMCP-1 compared with other treated groups. In conclusion, P-Asp can be considered as a promising candidate for use in the treatment of ALL."
2019,30551527,Comparison of antidiabetic effects of saponins and polysaccharides from Momordica charantia L. in STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice.,"Saponins as small organic molecules and polysaccharides as biomacromolecules are the main bioactive substances of Momordica charantia L. (M. charantia) with anti-hyperglycemic activities. This study was aimed to fully compare the antidiabetic effects and the potential mechanism of saponins (SMC) and polysaccharides (PMC) from M. charantia in STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice with high-fat diet. Three dosages of SMC (L-SMC: 20 mg/kg, M-SMC: 40 mg/kg, H-SMC: 80 mg/kg) have a certain of therapeutic effect on type 2 diabetic mice, and M-SMC (40 mg/kg) is the optimal dosage for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. The results showed that oral administration of SMC, especially M-SMC (40 mg/kg) compared to PMC (500 mg/kg), could significantly restore the body weight, reduce fasting blood glucose levels, ameliorate insulin resistance and increase the proportion of hepatic phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)/total protein. The above results proved that hypoglycemic mechanism of SMC might involve in the AMPK/NF-κB signal pathway by activating AMPK phosphorylation and regulating the energy metabolism of the body. However, oral administration of PMC could significant improve the antioxidant capacity by increasing the level of SOD and decreasing the level of MDA, and alleviate the STZ-induced organ tissues (kidney and pancreas), which proved that the hypoglycemic mechanism of PMC might by repairing the pancreatic β cells damaged by STZ."
2005,15997099,A red wine vinegar beverage can inhibit the renin-angiotensin system: experimental evidence in vivo.,"A new beverage made of red wine vinegar and grape juice (Budo-no-megumi) was developed for people who wish to take effective amount of both polyphenols and vinegar. Since the beverage was recently demonstrated to exert hypotensive effect in rats, we analyzed its underlying mechanisms in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and the blood pressure and lead II ECG were continuously monitored (n=6). The effects of recommended volume of the beverage (3 ml/kg, p.o.) on the renin-angiotensin system were assessed in vivo. At the basal control state, the increase in the mean blood pressure induced by the angiotensin I (1 microg/kg, i.v.) and norepinephrine (0.3-3 microg/kg, i.v.) were +57+/-2 and +36+/-8 mmHg, respectively. Sixty minutes after the administration of the beverage, the angiotensin I-induced pressor response decreased to +45+/-7 mmHg at 60 min (p<0.05), whereas no significant change was detected in the norepinephrine-induced pressor response. In another parallel series of the experiment using Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6), the serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was 39.4+/-1.2 IU/l at basal control state, which was slightly but significantly decreased to 37.0+/-1.4 IU/l at 60 min after the administration of the beverage (p<0.01). These results suggest that previously described hypotensive action of the beverage may be partly induced by the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme."
2019,31182169,"Effects of feed iodine concentrations and milk processing on iodine concentrations of cows' milk and dairy products, and potential impact on iodine intake in Swiss adults.","The contribution of milk and dairy products to daily iodine intake is high but variable in many industrialised countries. Factors that affect iodine concentrations in milk and dairy products are only poorly understood. Our aim was to: (1) assess the effect of feed iodine concentration on milk iodine by supplementing five groups of five cows each with one of five dosages from 0-2 mg iodine/kg DM; (2) quantify iodine losses during manufacturing of cheese and yogurt from milk with varying iodine concentrations and assess the effect of cellar-ripening; and (3) systematically measure iodine partitioning during heat treatment and skimming of milk. Milk iodine reached a near-steady state after 3 weeks of feeding. Median milk iodine (17-302 μg/l for 0-2 mg iodine/kg DM) increased linearly with feed iodine (R2 0·96; P < 0·001). At curd separation, 75-84 % of iodine was lost in whey. Dairy iodine increased linearly with milk iodine (semi-hard cheese: R2 0·95; P < 0·001; fresh cheese and yogurt: R2 1·00; P < 0·001), and cellar-ripening had no effect. Heat treatment had no significant effect, whereas skimming increased (P < 0·001) milk iodine concentration by only 1-2 μg/l. Mean daily intake of dairy products by Swiss adults is estimated at 213 g, which would contribute 13-52 % of the adults' RDA for iodine if cow feed is supplemented with 0·5-2 mg iodine/kg DM. Thus, modulation of feed iodine levels can help achieve desirable iodine concentrations in milk and dairy products, and thereby optimise their contribution to human iodine nutrition to avoid both deficiency and excess."
2009,19397837,Dietary diacylglycerol oil has no effect on hypertriacylglycerolaemia in lipoprotein lipase-deficient cats.,"A commercially available vegetable oil containing a high concentration (87 %, w/w) of diacylglycerol (DAG) has been investigated in humans and animals for potential beneficial effects in reducing serum TAG concentrations in fasting and postprandial states. Effects of DAG oil as a sole dietary fat source (25 % metabolisable energy) were evaluated in a feline model of hypertriacylglycerolaemia. Eleven adult (1.5 (sem 0.1) years) male cats deficient of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalytic activity from a heritable point mutation of the LPL gene were acclimatised to a semi-purified diet containing TAG oil for 21 d. After assignment into two groups, pair-matched by serum TAG concentrations (range 6.1-31.6 mmol/l), the cats were fed the diet with either TAG or DAG oil for 8 d. The dietary fat source was crossed-over and presented for 8 d more. Non-fasting serum concentrations of TAG, cholesterol and NEFA were measured on days 6-8 and days 14-16. Dietary fat source (DAG v. TAG) did not significantly affect food intake (491 (sem 16) v. 486 (sem 14) kJ/kg0.67), body weight or serum concentrations (mmol/l) of TAG (37.1 (sem 4.5) v. 33.9 (sem 3.4)), cholesterol (4.8 (sem 0.3) v. 4.8 (sem 0.2)) and NEFA (1.4 (sem 0.2) v. 1.4 (sem 0.2)). The results show that for a feeding trial of 8 d, DAG oil was well accepted and tolerated by cats but did not reduce hypertriacylglycerolaemia resulting from a deficiency of LPL catalytic activity."
2000,10879461,Purification and characterization of aspartic proteinase from sunflower seeds.,"Aspartic proteinases were purified from sunflower seed extracts by affinity chromatography on a pepstatin A-EAH Sepharose column and by Mono Q column chromatography. The final preparation contained three purified fractions. SDS-PAGE showed that one of the fractions consisted of disulfide-bonded subunits (29 and 9 kDa), and the other two fractions contained noncovalently bound subunits (29 and 9 kDa). These purified enzymes showed optimum pH for hemoglobinolytic activity at pH 3.0 and were completely inhibited by pepstatin A like other typical aspartic proteinases. Sunflower enzymes showed more restricted specificity on oxidized insulin B chain and glucagon than other aspartic proteinases. The cDNA coding for an aspartic proteinase was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that the mature enzyme consisted of 440 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 47,559 Da. The difference between the molecular size of purified enzymes and of the mature enzyme was due to the fact that the purified enzymes were heterodimers formed by the proteolytic processing of the mature enzyme. The derived amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed 30-78% sequence identity with that of other aspartic proteinases."
2012,21787455,The anti-metastatic efficacy of β-ionone and the possible mechanisms of action in human hepatocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 cells.,"β-Ionone (BI), a precursor for carotenoids, is widely distributed in fruit and vegetables. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential anti-metastatic effects of BI, but the mechanisms underlying such actions are not clear. Because liver cancer is the most endemic cancer in Taiwan and in a large region of the world, we hereby investigate the anti-metastatic effects of BI and its mechanisms of actions in a highly metastatic human hepatocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 cells. We show that incubation of cells with BI (1-50 μm) for 24 and 48 h significantly inhibited cell invasion, migration and adhesion. Mechanistically, incubation of cells with BI (1-50 μm) for 24 h resulted in the following: (1) significant inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator activities, (2) up-regulation of protein expression of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, (3) down-regulation of the expression of migration-related proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphorylated form of FAK, Rho, Rac1 and Cdc42 and (4) up-regulation of the expression of nm23-H1 protein (P < 0·05). Overall, the results show that BI effectively inhibits the metastasis of SK-Hep-1 cells, and this effect involves the regulation of gene expression and signal pathways related to invasion and migration."
2014,24516361,Toxicity effect of silver nanoparticles in brine shrimp Artemia.,"The present study revealed the toxic effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in Artemia nauplii and evaluated the mortality rate, hatching percentage, and genotoxic effect in Artemia nauplii/cysts. The AgNPs were commercially purchased and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Nanoparticles were spherical in nature and with size range of 30-40 nm. Artemia cysts were collected from salt pan, processed, and hatched in sea water. Artemia nauplii (II instar) were treated using silver nanoparticles of various nanomolar concentrations and LC50 value (10 nM) and mortality rate (24 and 48 hours) was evaluated. Hatching percentage of decapsulated cysts treated with AgNPs was examined. Aggregation of AgNPs in the gut region of nauplii was studied using phase contrast microscope and apoptotic cells in nauplii stained with acridine orange were observed using fluorescence microscope. DNA damage of single cell of nauplii was determined by comet assay. This study showed that as the concentration of AgNPs increased, the mortality rate, aggregation in gut region, apoptotic cells, and DNA damage increased in nauplii, whereas the percentage of hatching in Artemia cysts decreased. Thus this study revealed that the nanomolar concentrations of AgNPs have toxic effect on both Artemia nauplii and cysts."
2005,15802825,The endothelium-dependent vasodilator action of a new beverage made of red wine vinegar and grape juice.,"A new non-alcoholic beverage made of red wine vinegar and grape juice (Budo-no-megumi) has been recently demonstrated to lower the blood pressure of human as well as rats. In this study, we pharmacologically analyzed the mechanism of its hypotensive action. The thoracic aorta with intact endothelium was isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, and incubated with a Tyrode's solution. The beverage in concentrations of 0.25 to 2% relaxed the pre-contracted aorta with an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner, 2% of which induced 59% relaxation. In contrast, the vasodilator response disappeared in the aorta without endothelium. L-Nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, significantly reduced the vasodilator effect of the beverage, whereas indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, hardly affected it. These results suggest that the beverage can activate the nitric oxide synthase activity to exert vasodilation, which may partly explain its previously reported hypotensive action."
2019,30696997,Virus detection in the cerebrospinal fluid of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients is associated with poor patient outcomes: a CIBMTR contemporary longitudinal study.,"Limited data exist on characteristics of central nervous system viruses (CNS-V) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Between 2007 and 2015, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) received information on 27,532 patients undergoing HCT. Of these, centers reported 165 HCT recipients with CNS-V detected in cerebrospinal fluid within 6 months after HCT. CNS viruses predominantly included human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) (73%), followed by Epstein-Barr Virus (10%), cytomegalovirus (3%), varicella zoster virus (3%), herpes simplex virus (3%) and Adenovirus (3%). Median time of viral detection in CNS was 31 days after HCT; and viral detection was earlier in patients with CNS HHV-6. Concurrent viremia occurred in 52% of patients. Cord blood transplant recipients (CBT) accounted for the majority (53%) of patients with CNS-V. Myeloablative conditioning (65%), use of fludarabine (63%), or use of anti-thymocyte globulin (61%) were also predominant. Overall survival from the time of detection of CNS-V was 50% at 6 months and 30% at 5 years. Infections were the leading cause of death (32%). In summary, CBT recipients predominated in the population with CNS-V. Outcomes after CNS-V were poor with significant mortality seen in the first 6 months."
2013,23561168,Cultivar variations in antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic properties of pomelo pulp (Citrus grandis [L.] Osbeck) in Thailand.,"Pomelo (Citrus grandis L. Osbeck) is a native fruit of great economic importance in Southeast Asia. To provide experimental evidence for the antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic properties of pomelo, 6 cultivars, including Kao-Yai (KY), Thong-dee (TD), Kao-Tangkwa (KT), Kao-Numpueng (KN), Ta-Koi (TK), and Tubtim Siam (TS) were evaluated. KY had the highest phenolic content, and the strongest 1,1-diphenyl-2-pireyhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. From the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, naringin and naringenin were the major flavonoids in the KT and TK cultivars. Six pomelo cultivars had antihyperlipidemic activities including the inhibition of pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase, as well as cholesterol micelle formation and bile acid binding. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the 6 cultivars were separated into 2 classifications. In addition, the total phenolics of the pomelo cultivars were significantly correlated with ferric reducing antioxidant power and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity. The results suggest that pomelo provides significant health benefits and may be used for developing functional foods."
2008,18599028,Release of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from beta-amyloid plaques assemblies improves the spatial memory impairments in APP-transgenic mice.,"The major protein constituent of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta). Amyloid deposits contain ""chaperone molecules"" which play critical roles in amyloid formation and toxicity. In the present work, we test an analog of hyperforin (IDN 5706) which releases the AChE from both the Abeta fibrils and the AChE-Abeta burdens in transgenic mice. Hyperforin is an acylphloroglucinol compound isolated from Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), which is able to prevent the Abeta-induced spatial memory impairments and Abeta neurotoxicity. Altogether this gathered evidence indicates the important role of AChE in the neurotoxicity of Abeta plaques and finding new compounds which decrease the AChE-Abeta interaction may be a putative therapeutic agent to fight the disease."
2007,17202687,In vitro and in vivo antiallergic effect of the fructus of Evodia rutaecarpa and its constituents.,"The unripe fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa (JUSS) BENTH (ER, Family Rutaceae) has been used frequently as a traditional medicine against inflammatory diseases in Korea, China and Japan. To evaluate antiallergic effect of ER, we isolated its main constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, and evaluated in vivo their inhibitory effects against passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex and scratching behaviors by compound 48/80. ER and its constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, potently inhibited PCA reaction and scratching behaviors in mice, although ER weakly inhibited scratching behaviors. Evodiamine and rutaecarpine inhibited TNF-alpha and IL-4 protein expression in RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE-antigen complex, although these did not inhibit degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE-antigen complex and rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. These findings suggest that ER and its constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, may be effective for IgE-induced allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and rhinitis."
2019,30605873,Evaluating the protective efficacy of Silybum marianum against deltamethrin induced hepatotoxicity in piscine model.,"With the known facts of deltamethrin toxicity in aquaculture, efforts have been made to ameliorate its toxicity with supplementation of Silybum marianum plant extract in Cyprinus carpio. For validating its efficacy, standard techniques of histopathology, anti-oxidant profile and RAPD-PCR were used. By performing acute toxicity bioassay, 96 h LC50 of the pesticide to C. carpio was determined and was found to be 2 μg/L. Histopathological alterations were comprised of nuclear alterations, vacuolisation and oedema in the hepatocytes. Chronic exposure to the toxicant induced significant changes in antioxidant defense system (CAT, SOD, GSH and GST levels), lipid peroxidation being prominent. Diet supplementation with silymarin appeared to modulate the oxidative stress, histopathological alterations and genotoxic damage caused by the pesticide in the fish. RAPD-PCR studies revealed deltamethrin induced toxicity and its effective amelioration in form of restoration of bands which were lost in toxicant exposed DNA profile."
2011,21262220,Coenzyme Q10 counteracts testicular injury induced by sodium arsenite in rats.,"The protective effect of coenzyme Q10 against testicular toxicity induced by sodium arsenite (10mg/kg/day, orally for two consecutive days) was investigated in rats. Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for five consecutive days, starting three days before arsenite administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly increased serum testosterone level which was reduced by sodium arsenite. Coenzyme Q10 significantly suppressed lipid peroxidation, restored the depleted antioxidant defenses, and attenuated the increases of tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide resulted from arsenic administration. Also, the elevation of arsenic ion, and the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in testicular tissue were mitigated by coenzyme Q10. Histopathological examination showed that testicular injury mediated by arsenic was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the arsenic-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-κB, Fas ligand and caspase-3 in testicular tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect the testicular tissue from the detrimental effects of arsenic intoxication."
2010,20606295,"Resveratrol inhibits angiogenic response of cultured endothelial F-2 cells to vascular endothelial growth factor, but not to basic fibroblast growth factor.","Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol in grapes, is known to prevent the cardiovascular diseases and to exert the antiangiogenic effect in in vivo models with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). We examined the effect of resveratrol on tubule formation of cultured endothelial F-2 cells. In collagen gel matrix, F-2 cells formed an extended network of tubular structures in response to VEGF or bFGF. Resveratrol dose-dependently prevented the VEGF-induced tubule formation, but failed to inhibit the angiogenic response to bFGF. We next examined whether the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production is linked to the antiangiogenic effect of resveratrol on VEGF-stimulated F-2 cells, because NO plays a crucial role in VEGF-induced tubular network formation. NO production was increased by VEGF, but not by bFGF, and resveratrol inhibited VEGF-stimulated NO production. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) potently inhibited NO production under all conditions, including VEGF stimulation, and abrogated VEGF-induced tubule formation. However, L-NAME did not inhibit bFGF-induced tubule formation. To investigate the bFGF-induced in vivo antiangiogenic effect of resveratrol, we examined the effect of resveratrol on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) expression in NRK-F fibroblasts. COX-2 and its derived PGE(2) are important factors for bFGF-induced in vivo angiogenesis. Resveratrol dose-dependently prevented both COX-2 induction and PGE(2) production in bFGF-stimulated fibroblasts. These results suggest that resveratrol exerts the inhibitory effects on VEGF- and bFGF-induced angiogenesis through different mechanisms including inhibition of NO production in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells and inhibition of COX-2 induction in bFGF-stimulated fibroblasts."
1994,8296320,Theobromine toxicity on Sertoli cells and comparison with cocoa extract in male rats.,"The target cell(s) of theobromine toxicity on rat testes and reproductive toxicity induced by pure theobromine and cocoa extract are evaluated in the present studies. Theobromine (500 mg/kg x 7 days) inhibited body weight gain in treated rats. Decreased cauda epididymal sperm reserve (38%), seminiferous tubule fluid (STF) volume (33%), lactate concentration in STF (22%), inhibition of binding activity of androgen binding protein (ABP, 21%) and reduced ABP content in STF were also observed in theobromine-treated animals. Cocoa extract containing an equivalent amount of theobromine did not produce significant toxicity in treated rats. Theobromine concentrations in serum and testes from pure theobromine-treated rats were 1.8- and 1.6-fold higher, respectively, than that in rats treated with cocoa extract. The results support Sertoli cells as the primary target cells of theobromine toxicity. The lower theobromine concentrations in serum and testes of cocoa extract-treated rats could account for the lower toxicity in these animals."
2002,11828752,[Development of new methods in asymmetric reactions and their applications].,"Several novel methods using chiral reagents and biocatalysts for asymmetric reactions are described. Among those reactions, asymmetric reduction via a novel tandem Michael addition/Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of acyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones using a chiral mercapto alcohol, asymmetric synthesis of allene-1,3-dicarboxylate via crystallization induced asymmetric transformation, and improved asymmetric nitroolefination of lactones and lactames at alpha-carbon using new chiral reagents were developed. In the reactions using biocatalysts, asymmetric dealkoxycarbonylation of bicyclic beta-keto diesters having sigma-symmetry with lipase or esterase to give optically active beta-keto esters, the asymmetric reduction of bicyclic 1,3-diketones having sigma-symmetry with Baker's yeast to give optically active keto alcohols, and the asymmetric aldol reaction of glycine with threonine aldolase were also developed. The above mentioned products were effectively utilized as chiral building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of natural products and drugs."
2018,29415712,Anti-aging potential of extracts from Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst and its chemical profiling by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS.,"Degradation of components of the extracellular matrix such as elastin and collagen by elastase and collagenase accelerates skin aging. Phytochemicals that inhibit the activity of these enzymes can be developed as anti-aging ingredients. In this study, an investigation of the anti-aging properties of Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst (Marula) extracts was conducted in vitro with the aim of developing chemically characterized anti-aging ingredients.Marula stems, leaves and fruits were extracted using methanol:dichloromethane (DCM) (1:1). The stems were later extracted using acetone, ethanol, methanol:DCM (1:1) and sequentially using hexane, DCM, ethyl acetate and methanol. The stem ethanol extract was defatted and concentrated. Elastase and collagenase inhibition activities of these extracts and Marula oil were determined using spectrophotometric methods. The chemical profile of the ethanolic stem extract was developed using Ultra-performance-liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) with MassLynx software. Pure standards were used to confirm the identity of major compounds and were screened for anti-elastase and anti-collagenase activity.Marula stems extracts were the most active as they exhibited anti-elastase activity comparable to that of elafin (> 88%) and anti-collagenase activity as potent as EDTA (> 76%). The leaf extract had moderate anti-elastase activity (54%) but was inactive agains collagenase. Marula fruits and oil exhibited limited activity in both assays. The ethanolic extract of Marula stems was the most suitable based on its acceptability to the cosmetic industry and its anti-collagenase activity (99%). Defatting and concentration improved its antiaging activity and lowered the colour intensity. Six compounds have been tentatively identified in the chemical profile of the ethanolic extract of Marula stems of which four; quinic acid, catechin, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate have been confirmed using pure standards. Epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate were as potent (p < 0.05) as EDTA at 5 μg/ml in the anti-collagenase assay.The ethanolic extract of Marula stems can be developed into an anti-aging ingredient as it exhibited very good in vitro anti-aging activity and its chemical profile has been developed. Epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate contribute to the anti-aging activity of Marula stem ethanol extract."
2008,18451515,The effects of chronic resveratrol treatment on vascular responsiveness of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.,"Deficiency in the vasorelaxant capacity is a result of an oxidative stress in diabetic animals and seems to be an etiological factor of vascular complications of diabetes. The present study was designed to examine whether resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic compound which is naturally present in grape and red wine, has a protective effect on diabetic aorta. Resveratrol (5 mg/kg/d, i.p.) was administered for 42 d to streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg) induced diabetic rats. Loss of weight, hyperglycemia, and elevated levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in diabetic rats. Resveratrol treatment was significantly effective for these metabolic and biochemical abnormalities. The contractile responses of the aorta were recorded. Compared with control subjects, the aorta showed significantly enhanced contractile responses to noradrenaline (NA), but not to potassium chloride (KCl), in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with resveratrol significantly reversed the increases in responsiveness and sensitivity of aorta to noradrenaline. In diabetic aorta, the relaxation response to acetylcholine (Ach) was found to be significantly decreased compared with control subjects, and resveratrol treatment reversed this; no such change was observed in the relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). These results indicated that resveratrol significantly improved not only glucose metabolism and oxidative injury but also impaired vascular responses in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats."
2013,24041017,The antiproliferative effect of Moringa oleifera crude aqueous leaf extract on cancerous human alveolar epithelial cells.,"The incidence of lung cancer is expected to increase due to increases in exposure to airborne pollutants and cigarette smoke. Moringa oleifera (MO), a medicinal plant found mainly in Asia and South Africa is used in the traditional treatment of various ailments including cancer. This study investigated the antiproliferative effect of MO leaf extract (MOE) in cancerous A549 lung cells.A crude aqueous leaf extract was prepared and the cells were treated with 166.7 μg/ml MOE (IC50) for 24 h and assayed for oxidative stress (TBARS and Glutathione assays), DNA fragmentation (comet assay) and caspase (3/7 and 9) activity. In addition, the expression of Nrf2, p53, Smac/DIABLO and PARP-1 was determined by Western blotting. The mRNA expression of Nrf2 and p53 was assessed using qPCR.A significant increase in reactive oxygen species with a concomitant decrease in intracellular glutathione levels (p < 0.001) in MOE treated A549 cells was observed. MOE showed a significant reduction in Nrf2 protein expression (1.89-fold, p < 0.05) and mRNA expression (1.44-fold). A higher level of DNA fragmentation (p < 0.0001) was seen in the MOE treated cells. MOE's pro-apoptotic action was confirmed by the significant increase in p53 protein expression (1.02-fold, p < 0.05), p53 mRNA expression (1.59-fold), caspase-9 (1.28-fold, p < 0.05), caspase-3/7 (1.52-fold) activities and an enhanced expression of Smac/DIABLO. MOE also caused the cleavage and activation of PARP-1 into 89 KDa and 24 KDa fragments (p < 0.0001).MOE exerts antiproliferative effects in A549 lung cells by increasing oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation and inducing apoptosis."
1999,10102468,Vitamin K intake and sensitivity to warfarin in patients consuming regular diets.,"The effect of dietary vitamin K intake on warfarin sensitivity is known only from case reports and few small clinical studies. We followed 50 patients commencing warfarin and consuming their regular diets (for 8 weeks) to study this relationship. A one-week recall dietary questionnaire was completed at weeks 2 and 8. Daily intake of nutrients and vitamin K was calculated from standard tables. Warfarin sensitivity index (WSI) was defined as final INR/final warfarin dose (mg/day/m2 of body surface area) (week 8). Vitamin K intake was 17-974 (median: 179) microg/day. Median WSI was 0.82 (0.31-4.47). A WSI value of 1.1 significantly separated excess (>250 microg/day) from normal (<250 microg/day) vitamin K consumers (16/18 vs. 15/32, respectively, p <0.01). The former had lower day 5 INR (median: 1.9 vs. 3.0, p <0.001), needed more warfarin to achieve INR > or =2.0 (32.0+/-9.2 mg vs. 25.4+/-6.4 mg, p = 0.009) and required a higher maintenance steady state warfarin dose (5.7+/-1.7 mg/day vs. 3.5+/-1.0 mg/day, p <0.001). We conclude that in 32% (16/50) of anticoagulated patients under usual dietary conditions sensitivity to warfarin is decreased by vitamin K intake > or =250 microg/day."
,14556487,Antioxidant properties of captopril in vitro.,"This paper reports on the effect of captopril on the stability of unsaturated fatty acids in the evening primrose oil. The experiment was performed for captopril at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% in the samples of evening primrose oil at temperatures of 20 degrees, 40 degrees and 60 degrees C. The determination was performed on the 10th day of incubation. The results were compared to those obtained for analogous samples with octyl gallate, an antioxidant commonly used in oil systems, taken at the same concentrations and at the same temperatures. The changes in concentrations of the substances studied with time were monitored by gas chromatography. The results have shown captopril to be a stronger antioxidant than octyl gallate at all concentrations and temperatures used."
2018,29141236,Concentrations of a PGF2α metabolite during pregnancy on the days that luteolysis occurs in nonbred heifers.,"Concentrations of a metabolite of PGF2α (PGFM) were compared between nonbred (n = 6) and pregnant (n = 8) heifers on days 16, 17, and 18 postovulation. On each day, an 8-h session of hourly blood sampling was done. Averaged over the 8-h sessions, mean concentration of PGFM was less (P < 0.0009) in the pregnant group (45.2 ± 3.2 pg/mL) than that in the nonbred group (65.6 ± 7.9 pg/mL), but the minimal concentration per session was not significantly different between groups. Pulses of PGFM (identified by coefficient of variance) were similar in frequency between groups but were less (P < 0.03) prominent at the peak in the pregnant group (60.0 ± 5.3 pg/mL) than that in the nonbred group (92.8 ± 10.7 pg/mL). These results indicated similarity between groups in frequency and initial development of a PGFM pulse but without later development and a reduction in prominence in the pregnant group. The progesterone response to a PGFM pulse of similar prominence was made before the beginning of luteolysis in individuals in the nonbred group and during the hourly sessions on days 16 to 18 in the pregnant group. Progesterone concentration in the nonbred group decreased (P < 0.05) during 2 h before the PGFM peak (8.8 ± 1.6 to 5.6 ± 1.0 ng/mL) and rebounded (P < 0.05) completely during the 2 h after the peak (5.6 ± 1.0 to 9.6 ± 2.2 ng/mL). A transient progesterone decrease during a similar PGFM pulse and similar initial progesterone concentration did not occur in the pregnant group. Results supported the hypotheses that (1) pregnant heifers have identifiable but less prominent PGFM pulses during the days that luteolysis occurs in nonbred heifers and (2) the corpus luteum locally resists the luteolytic effect of PGF2α in pregnant heifers before the days of onset of luteolysis in nonbred heifers."
2016,27283600,Study of quinones reactions with wine nucleophiles by cyclic voltammetry.,"Quinones are electrophilic species which can react with various nucleophiles, like wine antioxidants, such as sulfur dioxide or ascorbic acid, thiols, amino acids, and numerous polyphenols. These reactions are very important in wine aging because they mediate oxygen reactions during both production and bottle aging phases. In this work, the major challenge was to determine the interaction between ortho-quinones and wine nucleophiles (amino acids, thiols, and the antioxidants SO2 and ascorbic acid), by cyclic voltammetry. Wine-model solutions with gallic acid, caffeic acid, or (+)-catechin and nucleophilic compounds were used. To understand the effect of nucleophilic addition in wine, a white wine with the same added nucleophiles was also analysed. Cyclic voltammograms were taken with glassy carbon electrode or screen-printed carbon electrodes, respectively, for wine-model and white wines solutions, in the absence and in the presence of nucleophiles. A nucleophilic order profile related to the cathodic current intensity decrease was observed. "
2014,24168107,Effect of mushroom diet on pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in healthy Chinese subjects.,"This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in Chinese subjects who received a diet rich in shiitake mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to contain high amount of ergothioneine. In vitro studies have shown that OCTN1-mediated secretion of gabapentin is trans-stimulated by ergothioneine. This study also investigated the concentrations of ergothioneine in plasma at baseline and following mushroom consumption.Ten healthy male subjects were recruited and received a diet containing no mushrooms (treatment A) or a high mushroom diet (treatment B; after at least a 7 day washout period) 1 day prior to administration of a single oral dose of gabapentin 600 mg.Ingestion of shiitake mushrooms produced significant increases in plasma ergothioneine concentrations that were sustained for more than 48 h. A statistically significant but modest increase in the renal clearance (CLR ) of gabapentin occurred after intake of the mushroom diet (91.1 ± 25.1 vs. 76.9 ± 20.6 ml min(-1) , P = 0.031). No significant changes in AUC(0,tlast ) of gabapentin were observed (P = 0.726). Creatinine clearance did not correlate with CLR of gabapentin at baseline (treatment A). After ingestion of the mushroom diet, creatinine clearance accounted for 65.3% of the variance in CLR of gabapentin.These data suggest that diet-drug pharmacokinetic interactions may occur during co-exposure to gabapentin and mushroom constituents. However, as it does not affect the AUC(0,tlast ) of gabapentin, it may not have clinically important consequences. Shiitake mushrooms can also be used as a source of ergothioneine for future clinical studies."
2018,29845904,Dietary supplementation with blueberry partially restores T-cell-mediated function in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice.,"Blueberry, rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals, has been demonstrated to lower inflammatory status in adipose induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and obesity. The effect of blueberry on systemic immune functions has not been examined. C57BL/6 mice were randomised to one of three diets - low-fat diet (LFD), HFD and HFD plus 4 % (w/w) blueberry (HFD+B) - for 8 or 12 weeks. Ex vivo T-cell mitogens (concanavalin A (Con A); phytohaemagglutinin), T-cell antibody (anti-CD3; anti-CD3/CD28)-stimulated T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. After 8 weeks, both HFD groups weighed more (>4 g) than the LFD group; after 12 weeks, HFD+B-fed mice weighed more (>6 g) and had 41 % more adipose tissue than HFD-fed mice (P<0·05). After 12 weeks, T-cell proliferation was less in both HFD groups, compared with the LFD group. HFD-associated decrements in T-cell proliferation were partially (10-50 %) prevented by blueberry supplementation. At 12 weeks, splenocytes from HFD mice, but not from HFD+B mice, produced 51 % less IL-4 (CD3/CD28) and 57 % less interferon-γ (Con A) compared with splenocytes from LFD mice (P<0·05). In response to lipopolysaccharide challenge, splenocytes from both HFD groups produced 24-30 % less IL-6 and 27-33 % less TNF-α compared with splenocytes from LFD mice (P<0·05), indicating impaired acute innate immune response. By demonstrating deleterious impacts of HFD feeding on T-cell proliferation and splenocyte immune responses, our results provide insights into how HFD/obesity can disrupt systemic immune function. The protective effects of blueberry suggest that dietary blueberry can buttress T-cell and systemic immune function against HFD-obesity-associated insults."
2019,31077340,"Propofol use in children with allergies to egg, peanut, soybean or other legumes.","Propofol is the most commonly administered intravenous agent for anaesthesia in children. However, there are concerns that the emulsified preparation may not be safe in children with an allergy to egg, peanut, soybean or other legumes. We conducted a retrospective study of children with immunologically confirmed egg, peanut, soybean or legume allergy and who underwent general anaesthesia at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children between 2005 and 2015. We extracted details regarding allergy diagnosis, each anaesthetic administered and any adverse events or signs of an allergic reaction in the peri-operative period. A convenience sample of patients without any known food allergies was identified from our prospective anaesthesia research database and acted as a control group. We identified 304 food-allergic children and 649 procedures where propofol was administered. Of these, 201 (66%) had an egg allergy, 226 (74%) had a peanut allergy, 28 (9%) had a soybean allergy and 12 (4%) had a legume allergy. These were compared with 892 allergy-free patients who were exposed to propofol. In 10 (3%) allergy patients and 124 (14%) allergy-free patients, criteria for a possible allergic reaction were met. In nine of the food-allergic children and in all the controls valid non-allergic explanations for the clinical symptoms were found. One likely mild allergic reaction was experienced by a child with a previous history of intralipid allergy. We conclude that genuine serious allergic reaction to propofol is rare and is not reliably predicted by a history of food allergy."
2003,12720588,Comparison of the effects of linseed oil and different doses of fish oil on mononuclear cell function in healthy human subjects.,"Studies on animal and human subjects have shown that greatly increasing the amount of linseed (also known as flaxseed) oil (rich in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) alpha-linolenic acid (ALNA)) or fish oil (FO; rich in the long-chain n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) in the diet can decrease a number of markers of immune function. The immunological effects of more modest doses of n-3 PUFA in human subjects are unclear, dose-response relationships between n-3 PUFA supply and immune function have not been established and whether ALNA has the same effects as its long-chain derivatives is not known. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the effect of enriching the diet with different doses of FO or with a modest dose of ALNA on a range of functional responses of human monocytes and lymphocytes. In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study, forty healthy males aged 18-39 years were randomised to receive placebo or 3.5 g ALNA/d or 0.44, 0.94 or 1.9 g (EPA+DHA)/d in capsules for 12 weeks. The EPA:DHA ratio in the FO used was 1.0:2.5. ALNA supplementation increased the proportion of EPA but not DHA in plasma phospholipids. FO supplementation decreased the proportions of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid and increased the proportions of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipids. The interventions did not alter circulating mononuclear cell subsets or the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 or interferon-gamma by stimulated mononuclear cells. There was little effect of the interventions on lymphocyte proliferation. The two higher doses of FO resulted in a significant decrease in IL-6 production by stimulated mononuclear cells. It is concluded that, with the exception of IL-6 production, a modest increase in intake of either ALNA or EPA+DHA does not influence the functional activity of mononuclear cells. The threshold of EPA+DHA intake that results in decreased IL-6 production is between 0.44 and 0.94 g/d."
,9673365,"The in vitro anti-tumor activity of some crude and purified components of blackseed, Nigella sativa L.","A crude gum, a fixed oil and two purified components of Nigella sativa seed, thymoquinone (TQ) and dithymoquinone (DIM), were assayed in vitro for their cytotoxicity for several parental and multi-drug resistant (MDR) human tumor cell lines. Although as much as 1% w/v of the gum or oil was devoid of cytotoxicity, both TQ and DIM were cytotoxic for all of the tested cell lines (IC50's 78 to 393 microM). Both the parental cell lines and their corresponding MDR variants, over 10-fold more resistant to the standard antineoplastic agents doxorubicin (DOX) and etoposide (ETP), as compared to their respective parental controls, were equally sensitive to TQ and DIM. The inclusion of the competitive MDR modulator quinine in the assay reversed MDR Dx-5 cell resistance to DOX and ETP by 6- to 16-fold, but had no effect on the cytotoxicity of TQ or DIM. Quinine also increased MDR Dx-5 cell accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate 3H-taxol in a dose-dependent manner. However, neither TQ nor DIM significantly altered cellular accumulation of 3H-taxol. The inclusion of 0.5% v/v of the radical scavenger DMSO in the assay reduced the cytotoxicity of DOX by as much as 39%, but did not affect that of TQ or DIM. These studies suggest that TQ and DIM, which are cytotoxic for several types of human tumor cells, may not be MDR substrates, and that radical generation may not be critical to their cytotoxic activity."
2013,24028940,Galangin inhibits proliferation of HepG2 cells by activating AMPK via increasing the AMP/TAN ratio in a LKB1-independent manner.,"Galangin, a flavonol derived from Alpinia officinarum Hance and used as food additives in southern China, induces apoptosis and autophagy to suppress the proliferation of HepG2 cells. In this study, we demonstrated that galangin induced autophagy by increasing the ratio of AMP/TAN in HepG2 cells. It stimulated the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and LKB1, but inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. Inhibition of AMPK activation suppressed the dephosphorylation of mTOR to block galangin-induced autophagy. AMPK activation by galangin appeared to be independent of the LKB1 signaling pathway because the down-regulation of LKB1 by its siRNA failed to affect galangin-induced autophagy. Collectively, the findings demonstrated a novel mechanism of how galangin induces autophagy via activating AMPK in a LKB1- independent manner. The induction of autophagy can thus reflect the anti-proliferation effect of galangin in HCC cells. "
2009,19809869,Resveratrol supplementation gender independently improves endothelial reactivity and suppresses superoxide production in healthy rats.,"Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound mainly abundant in red wines, has beneficial cardiovascular effects on various pathological conditions. However, at present, the effect of resveratrol on health promotion remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we assessed whether long-term resveratrol supplementation changes endothelial function, vascular contractility, nitric oxide and superoxide production in healthy male and female rats.Wistar rats were treated with resveratrol (50 mg/l) in their drinking water for 3 weeks. We investigated relaxation to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) M) and contractions to phenylephrine (10(-9)-3 x 10(-4) M) and angiotensin II (10(-10)-10(-5) M) in either endothelium-intact or denuded aortae from control and resveratrol-treated male and female rats. Aortic superoxide production capacity was measured in response to provocation by angiotensin II and NAD(P)H. Plasma nitrite/nitrate levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were also evaluated.Resveratrol supplementation gender independently increased relaxation to acetylcholine and decreased contractions to phenylephrine and angiotensin II in endothelium-intact aortic rings, but not in endothelium-denuded arteries, from healthy male and female rats. This was associated with increased plasma nitrite/nitrate levels. Furthermore, resveratrol caused a refractoriness to angiotensin II and NAD(P)H-induced provocation in superoxide production.Our results suggest that resveratrol supplementation gender independently could improve the capacity of endothelial function and suppression of oxidative stress under physiological conditions. Resveratrol ingestion indicates a potential for cardiovascular health promotion."
2016,26304321,Considerations on the use of enzyme-assisted extraction in combination with pressurized liquids to recover bioactive compounds from algae.,"Pressurized liquids, PLE, and enzyme-assisted extraction, EAE, have been tested to improve the extraction of phlorotannins from the seaweed Sargassum muticum. Enzymatic treatment with proteases and carbohydrases, alkaline hydrolysis and PLE with ethanol:water as extracting solvent have been studied in terms of extraction yield, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (TEAC assay). Results demonstrated that the application of PLE alone provided the highest yields and relevant antioxidant activity. An experimental design was employed to further optimize the PLE extraction conditions; optimum parameters included the use of 160 °C and 95% ethanol. Under these conditions, values of 21.9%, 94.0mg gallic acid equivalents g(-1), 5.018 mg phloroglucinol equivalents g(-1) and 1.275 mmol trolox equivalents g(-1) were obtained for extraction yield, total phenols, total phlorotannins and TEAC, respectively. A preliminary chemical characterization by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry provided insight in terms of the mechanisms involved in the different processes."
2018,29680039,Sulfur dioxide induced aggregation of wine thaumatin-like proteins: Role of disulfide bonds.,"Aggregation of heat unstable wine proteins is responsible for the economically and technologically detrimental problem called wine protein haze. This is caused by the aggregation of thermally unfolded proteins that can precipitate in bottled wine. To study the influence of SO2 in this phenomenon, wine proteins were isolated and thaumatins were identified has the most prone to aggregate in the presence of this compound. Isolated wine thaumatins aggregation was followed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our experimental results demonstrate that protein thermal unfolding after exposure of the protein to 70 °C does not present differences whether SO2 is present or not. Conversely, when the protein solution is cooled to 15 °C (after heat stress) significant analytical changes can be observed between samples with and without SO2. A remarkable change of circular dichroism spectra in the region 220-230 nm is observed (which can be related to S-S torsion angles), as well as an increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity (absence of fluorescence quenching by S-S bonds). Formation of covalently-linked dimeric and tetrameric protein species were also detected by SEC. The ability to dissolve the aggregates with 8 M urea seems to indicate that hydrophobic interactions are prevalent in the formed aggregates. Also, the reduction of these aggregates with tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) to only monomeric species reveals the presence of intermolecular S-S bonds."
1990,2327612,Influence of recombinant human interleukin-2 administration on lymphocyte and neutrophil function in clinically normal and dexamethasone-treated cattle.,"Recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was evaluated for its influence on total and differential WBC counts, lymphocyte blastogenic responsiveness to mitogens, and several measurements of neutrophil function in clinically normal and in dexamethasone-treated cattle. A single dose of rhIL-2 (2.5 X 10(7) U) given SC had no influence on the total or differential WBC count; however, it did cause an inhibition of neutrophil random migration. The other measurements of neutrophil function (Staphylococcus aureus ingestion, cytochrome C reduction, iodination, and antibody-dependent and antibody-independent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) evaluated were not significantly altered. The rhIL-2 treatment was associated with a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in uptake of [3H]thymidine in unstimulated lymphocytes and a tendency toward enhanced blastogenesis of lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. This enhancement was significant (P less than 0.05) only when the results were expressed as a stimulation index. Lymphocyte responsiveness to concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen was not significantly influenced by rhIL-2 administration. Dexamethasone (0.04 mg/kg) administered every 24 hours for 3 consecutive days altered the WBC count and several measurements of lymphocyte and neutrophil function. The administration of a single dose of rhIL-2 (2.5 X 10(7) U) 8 hours after the first dose of dexamethasone did not alter the influence of dexamethasone on any of the measurements. These results indicated that rhIL-2 has some biologic activity in cattle, but when used as administered here, did not overcome the influence of dexamethasone on the in vitro measurements of lymphocyte and neutrophil function that were evaluated."
2014,25446862,Protective effect of Satureja montana extract on cyclophosphamide-induced testicular injury in rats.,"The present study investigated the protective effect of Satureja montana extract against cyclophosphamide-induced testicular injury in rats. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extract were 1.03% and 0.34%w/w of dry herb expressed as chlorogenic acid and quercetin, respectively. HPLC analysis identified caffeic, syringic and rosmarinic acids as the chief phenolic acids, and rutin as the major flavonoid in the extract. Oral daily administration of S.montana extract (50mg/kg/day) for 7days before and 7days after an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (200mg/kg) restored the reduced relative testicular weight, serum testosterone level and testicular alkaline phosphatase activity, raised the lowered testicular sorbitol dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities, and decreased the elevated testicular hemoglobin absorbance. It also attenuated lipid peroxidation, restored the lowered glutathione content, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, and improved total antioxidant capacity. Moreover, S.montana extract mitigated testicular DNA fragmentation, decreased the elevated Fas and Bax gene expression, up-regulated the decreased Bcl-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) gene expression and normalized Akt1 protein level. Histopathological investigation confirmed the protective effects of the extract. Conclusively, S.montana extract protects the rat testis against cyclophosphamide-induced damage via anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic mechanisms that seem to be mediated, at least in part, by PPAR-γ and Akt1 up-regulation.

2010,20331462,"Systematic review of the addition of vincristine plus steroid pulses in maintenance treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - an individual patient data meta-analysis involving 5,659 children.","Vincristine plus steroid pulses have long been a part of maintenance treatment in many protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). A collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis of all randomised trials of the addition of vincristine plus prednisone/prednisolone (VP) pulses in childhood ALL was updated and extended to include trials comparing vincristine plus dexamethasone (VD) pulses to maintenance without pulses. VP pulses improved event-free survival (EFS) (70.1% vs. 62.0% at 5 years; odds ratio (OR) = 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.84; P = 0.00004); VD pulses did not have a significant effect (80.9% vs. 79.9% 5 year EFS; OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.80-1.11; P = 0.5). Heterogeneity between groups (VP or VD) was significant (P = 0.02). Neither treatment clearly affected overall survival. The difference between the VP and VD results is probably due to the greater early intensity of the backbone of the VD trial protocols and improved outcome seen in the VD trials, which were more recent. Pulses may still be useful in cases where less intensive early therapy is used and the balance between these treatments in terms of both effectiveness and toxicity needs to be considered."
2006,15946717,"Effects of zinc oxide and Enterococcus faecium SF68 dietary supplementation on the performance, intestinal microbiota and immune status of weaned piglets.","The objective of this study was to determine the effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) and the probiotic Enterococcus faecium SF68 (Cylactin) dietary supplementation on the performance, intestinal microbiota and immune parameters of the weaned piglet reared under commercial conditions. The diets were devoid of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). Two hundred and eight crossbred piglets were allocated to a 2 x 2 factorial experiment involving two levels of zinc oxide supplementation (0 or 3100 mg ZnO/kg feed), and two levels of E. faecium SF68 supplementation (0 or 1.4 x 10(9)CFU/kg feed (Cylactin ME10)). The diets were offered ad libitum for 20 days post-weaning. Piglet performance was assessed by calculating average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) on a pen basis. In addition, components of the distal ileal digesta, tissue-associated and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) bacterial populations were enumerated and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations were determined on days 6 and 20 post-weaning. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the bacterial populations at the different sites. Supplementation of the post-weaning diet with either ZnO or E. faecium SF68 did not affect piglet performance. E. faecium SF68 did not affect gastrointestinal bacterial populations but did tend to reduce serum IgG (P<0.1) on day 20. Zinc oxide reduced anaerobic (P<0.05) and tended to decrease lactic acid (P<0.1) bacterial translocation to the MLN, and tended to increase intestinal IgA concentration (P<0.1) on day 20. Generally, luminal bacterial populations were found to be poor predictors of tissue-associated or MLN populations. ZnO and E. faecium SF68 dietary supplementation were ineffective under these trial conditions. Further investigations into the possible immunomodulator role of dietary ZnO are warranted."
2013,23771005,A novel clofarabine bridge strategy facilitates allogeneic transplantation in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.,"Patients with relapsed/refractory leukemias or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) fare poorly following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). We report prospective phase II study results of 29 patients given clofarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day i.v. × 5 days followed immediately by HCT conditioning while at the cytopenic nadir. A total of 15/29 patients (52%) were cytoreduced according to pre-defined criteria (cellularity <20% and blasts <10%). Marrow cellularity (P<0.0001) and blast% (P=0.03) were reduced. Toxicities were acceptable, with transient hyperbilirubinemia (48%) and gr3-4 infections (10%). In all, 28/29 proceeded to transplant; 27 received ATG or alemtuzumab. Post HCT, 180 day non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-21), relapse was 29% (95% CI: 13-46) and OS was 71% (95% CI: 51-85), comparing favorably to published data for high-risk patients. Two-year graft vs host disease incidence was 40% (95% CI: 21-58) and 2 year OS was 31% (95% CI: 14-48). Disease at the nadir correlated with inferior OS after HCT (HR=1.22 for each 10% marrow blasts, 95% CI: 1.02-1.46). For AML/MDS patients, there was a suggestion that successful cytoreduction increased PFS (330 vs 171 days, P=0.3) and OS (375 vs 195 days, P=0.31). Clofarabine used as a bridge to HCT reduces disease burden, is well tolerated, and permits high-risk patients to undergo HCT with acceptable NRM. Late relapses are common; thus, additional strategies should be pursued. NCT-00724009. "
2015,26528995,"Lactic Acid Fermentation, Urea and Lime Addition: Promising Faecal Sludge Sanitizing Methods for Emergency Sanitation.","In this research, three faecal sludge sanitizing methods-lactic acid fermentation, urea treatment and lime treatment-were studied for application in emergency situations. These methods were investigated by undertaking small scale field trials with pit latrine sludge in Blantyre, Malawi. Hydrated lime was able to reduce the E. coli count in the sludge to below the detectable limit within 1 h applying a pH > 11 (using a dosage from 7% to 17% w/w, depending faecal sludge alkalinity), urea treatment required about 4 days using 2.5% wet weight urea addition, and lactic acid fermentation needed approximately 1 week after being dosed with 10% wet weight molasses (2 g (glucose/fructose)/kg) and 10% wet weight pre-culture (99.8% pasteurised whole milk and 0.02% fermented milk drink containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota). Based on Malawian prices, the cost of sanitizing 1 m³ of faecal sludge was estimated to be €32 for lactic acid fermentation, €20 for urea treatment and €12 for hydrated lime treatment."
2012,22248145,Cranberry proanthocyanidins inhibit the adherence properties of Candida albicans and cytokine secretion by oral epithelial cells.,"Oral candidiasis is a common fungal disease mainly caused by Candida albicans. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of A-type cranberry proanthocyanidins (AC-PACs) on pathogenic properties of C. albicans as well as on the inflammatory response of oral epithelial cells induced by this oral pathogen.Microplate dilution assays were performed to determine the effect of AC-PACs on C. albicans growth as well as biofilm formation stained with crystal violet. Adhesion of FITC-labeled C. albicans to oral epithelial cells and to acrylic resin disks was monitored by fluorometry. The effects of AC-PACs on C. albicans-induced cytokine secretion, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 activation and kinase phosphorylation in oral epithelial cells were determined by immunological assays.Although AC-PACs did not affect growth of C. albicans, it prevented biofilm formation and reduced adherence of C. albicans to oral epithelial cells and saliva-coated acrylic resin discs. In addition, AC-PACs significantly decreased the secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 by oral epithelial cells stimulated with C. albicans. This anti-inflammatory effect was associated with reduced activation of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylation of specific signal intracellular kinases.AC-PACs by affecting the adherence properties of C. albicans and attenuating the inflammatory response induced by this pathogen represent potential novel therapeutic agents for the prevention/treatment of oral candidiasis."
2013,24237471,A combination of grapefruit seed extract and concentrated cranberry juice as a potential antimicrobial preservative for the improvement of microbiological stability of hypromellose gel.,"Aqueous hypromellose gels are not microbiologically stable - they show signs of microorganism growth during storage. To extend the shelf-life of the gels, antimicrobial preservatives are needed. Some substances of plant origin are known for their antimicrobial properties, and thus they may be used as an alternative to synthetic preservatives. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological stability of aqueous hypromellose gel and the effectiveness of natural substances - grapefruit seed extract (GSE), concentrated cranberry juice, and a combination thereof - on the antimicrobial protection of the gel. The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of GSE and cranberry juice showed that their antimicrobial effects differed. Both cranberry juice and GSE inhibited the growth of the standard gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but the effect of GSE was significantly stronger. Candida albicans was sensitive only to GSE. For this reason, in order to affect all the microorganisms studied, either a combination of 0.7% GSE and 10% cranberry juice, or 5% GSE alone may be used. The combination of GSE and cranberry juice was effective only in acidic medium (pH being 2.5-5), while the antimicrobial effect of GSE was not dependent on the pH value."
2005,15856184,Decreasing the oxidant stress from paraquat in isolated perfused rat lung using captopril and niacin.,"The abilities of captopril and niacin to protect against the lung toxicity of paraquat (PQ) were studied. The anti-oxidative action of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, appears to be attributable to the sulphahydryl group (SH) in the compound, which gives captopril the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Niacin replenishes the NAD and ATP depletion caused by reactive oxygen species. PQ causes lung damage in man and in several species of laboratory animals. The damage is initially manifested by hemorrhage and edema, and later by consolidation of the lung and fibrosis development. In this study, the lungs of male Wistar rats (250-300 g in weight) were perfused by Krebs-Ringer buffer alone (control), niacin (150 microM), captopril (10 microM) and PQ (600 microM) in perfusion fluid, and the biochemical changes that occurred in isolated rat lung were examined within 1 h and compared to PQ alone. The results show that captopril significantly decreases the lung weight/body weight ratio when used as a pretreatment and a post-treatment to captopril (p<0.0001). The results also show that captopril (10 microM) and niacin (150 microM) significantly decreases PQ-induced lung toxicity. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity significantly decreased in treatment groups as compared to the PQ group (p<0.0001). This study suggests that paraquat causes increased lipid peroxidation and LDH activity and decreased glutathione (GSH) and total protein in isolated perfused rat lung. These effects are reduced under these experimental conditions by captopril and niacin."
2011,21963490,Electrocardiographic and biochemical evidence for the cardioprotective effect of antioxidants in acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in the beagle dogs.,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antitumor agent, but the cardiotoxicity mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species limit its clinical use. The present study aims to explore electrocardiographic and biochemical evidence for the cardioprotective effect of two antioxidants, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP, the main antioxidant in Lycium barbarum) and edaravone (a potent free radical scavenger, EDA) against DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity in beagle dogs. In this study, male beagle dogs received daily treatment of either LBP (20 mg/kg, per os (p.o.)) or EDA (2 mg/kg, intravenously (i.v.)) for 7 d and then followed by an intravenous injection of DOX (1.5 mg/kg). DOX (15 mg/kg) significantly induced acute cardiotoxicity in dogs characterized by conduction abnormalities (including decreased heart rate, ST segment elevation, QT intervals prolongation, inverted T wave, arrhythmia, and myocardial ischemia) and increased serum creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Pretreatment with LBP or EDA effectively alleviated both DOX-associated conduction abnormalities and increased serum CK and AST. Moreover, physiological and serum biochemical evidences demonstrated that EDA is more effective than LBP in alleviating these abnormalities produced by DOX in heart. All these results confirm and extend previous observations in rats concerning the effectiveness of LBP or EDA against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy."
2017,28092840,Suppressive effect of Spirulina fusiformis on diclofenac-induced hepato-renal injury and gastrointestinal ulcer in Wistar albino rats: A biochemical and histological approach.,"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac causes hepato-renal toxicity and gastric ulcer. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Spirulina fusiformis on Diclofenac-induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats.Rats were treated as follows: normal control (group I); diclofenac (50mg/kgb.w., i.p.) treated rats (group II); diclofenac-induced (50mg/kgb.w., i.p.) rats treated with Spirulina fusiformis (400mg/kgb.w., p.o.) (group III); diclofenac-induced (50mg/kgb.w., i.p.) rats treated with silymarin (25mg/kgb.w., p.o.) (group IV); Spirulina fusiformis (400mg/kgb.w., p.o.) alone treated rats (groupV). Biochemical (liver and kidney functional markers) and antioxidant parameters (enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants) were measured in the blood and tissue homogenates of the rats. Evaluation of intestinal ulcer score and assessment of liver and kidney histology were also done.Alterations in the levels of biochemical and antioxidant assays and histopathological changes in liver and kidney proved the toxic effect of diclofenac. The ulcer score was significantly increased in the diclofenac treated rats. Spirulina fusiformis showed to reduce such changes and was able to restore normal antioxidant status in the rats.Our study proves the hepato-renal and gastroprotective activity of Spirulina fusiformis in diclofenac-treated rats."
2019,30543483,Pharmacokinetic Study of Compound K in Japanese Subjects After Ingestion of Panax ginseng Fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei A221 Reveals Significant Increase of Absorption into Blood.,"Compound K (CK) is a metabolite of a saponin in Panax ginseng, formed from ginsenoside, a triterpenoid glycoside, by human intestinal bacteria. Lactobacillus paracasei A221 isolated from fermented food can hydrolyze (deglycosylate) the main ginsenoside, ginsenoside Rb1, and generate CK. However, the pharmacokinetics of L. paracasei A221 fermented ginseng (FG) and nonfermented ginseng (NFG) have not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of CK after oral administration of single doses of FG and NFG in healthy Japanese adults. An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, crossover study was conducted in 12 Japanese healthy volunteers (five men and seven women, aged 40-60 years). All subjects were equally allocated into two groups and administered tablets containing FG or NFG. Until 24 h after the administration, blood samples were sequentially collected, plasma concentrations of CK were measured, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. We also expected restoration of decreased testosterone level as one of the beneficial effects of FG and measured plasma total testosterone concentrations in male volunteers. The means of Tmax, Cmax, and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly different between the two groups. In the FG group, AUC0-12h (ng h/mL) and AUC0-24h (ng h/mL) were, respectively, 58.3- and 17.5-fold higher than those in the NFG group. Moreover, mean testosterone concentration in the FG group significantly increased 24 h after administration. These results showed that the main ginsenoside metabolite of ginseng, CK, produced by L. paracasei A221 has potential utility in health maintenance in healthy middle-aged and old Japanese adults."
2019,30696362,1H Quantitative NMR analyses of β-asarone and related compounds for quality control of Acorus rhizome herbal drugs in terms of the effects of their constituents on in vitro acetylcholine esterase activity.,"We used quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance analyses to measure the contents of major constituents of Acorus rhizome materials used as herbal drugs. The inhibitory effects of crude n-hexane extracts and their individual constituents on in vitro acetylcholine esterase activity were evaluated. The crude extracts had unexpectedly weak inhibitory effects (46-64% inhibition at 1.0 mg/mL), despite the high content (46-64%) of β-asarone, which independently had a potent effect (IC50 2.9 µM [0.61 µg/mL]). Further investigation revealed participation of eudesmin A, a lignan constituent, in the suppression of the inhibitory effect of β-asarone."
2010,19747411,Fish oil diets do not improve insulin sensitivity and secretion in healthy adult male pigs.,"The effects of long-term dietary supplementation of fish oil (n-3 PUFA-rich) in adult male pigs on body condition as well as insulin sensitivity and secretion were examined. Fifteen Duroc boars aged 204.5 (sd 9.4) d (body weight 145.8 (sd 16.8) kg) received daily 2.5 kg basal diet with a supplement of: (1) 62 g hydrogenated animal fat (n 5); (2) 60 g menhaden oil containing 10.8 g DHA and 9.0 g EPA (n 6); (3) 60 g tuna oil containing 19.8 g DHA and 3.9 g EPA (n 4). Rations were balanced to be isoenergetic. After 7 months of treatments, oral glucose and meal tolerance tests were conducted after insertion of a catheter into the jugular vein. Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA altered the blood plasma profile: DHA and EPA increased whereas arachidonic acid decreased (P < 0.01). Plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide responses to oral glucose and the test meal were not affected by treatments (P>0.34). For all animals, total body fat estimated from body weight and back fat thickness was correlated with both beta-cell function (by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA); r+0.63) and insulin sensitivity (index of whole-body insulin sensitivity and by HOMA; r - 0.63 and r+0.66, respectively). In conclusion, long-term supplementation with dietary n-3 PUFA did not affect insulin metabolism in healthy adult male pigs. The relationship between body fat and insulin sensitivity, well documented in human subjects, suggests that the adult male pig could be a promising animal model for studies on insulin metabolism."
